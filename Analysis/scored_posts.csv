In which case Trump will still brag about how much worse shit we could‘ve been in had it not been for him.

At the very very very best, we will be on life support at that juncture, like we are now, EXCEPT most people will all be in agreement about it, save a few diehard retard boomers like that bitch who got fired from fox for saying Wuhan virus is a fake plot to overthrow Trump. In any case, come November,  we all will all know how much worse it will get before it gets better. Trump will probably pivot to something like: “Imagine if demented Joe were at the helm. Then we’d really be fucked!”

And he might be right. But the more I think about it, when I see all you ABSOLUTE FUCKING RETARDS yoloing your life savings away on a whim, like a fucking millennial licking an ICU toilet seat in NYC, and still somehow making it out on top, I could actually see how in some ridiculous parallel universe, Joe Biden could be the unlikely retard who weathers us through the upcoming shitstorm, and into greener pastures.

But even though any halfway competent incumbent like a Governor Cuomo, would have a halfway decent chance of beating Trump, and even though Biden will be handed this presidency on a silver platter, Trump will still be re-elected, for better or worse.

First off, I'm a simple man that uses elementary ta to predict price movements with just a few indicators in my toolbox to gamble the future. Today I'm presenting two to support my hypothesis, Bollinger bands and Fibonacci retracement (in the discord we call this the double inverse fettucini retracement witcher indicator). I'm not going to explain these indicators at length because someone on google that isn't blitzed right now will do you better.

3) Hey, look. we are overbought, bigly.

**Economics and other points**

I don't think I have to go into deep detail on our economic situation, as it's posted everywhere on here and cnbc, bloomberg etc, and I'm not gonna argue about how rallys usually quickly follow steep declines like we experienced in march. What I will say is, in the upcoming couple days, [more and more shitty, leveraged banks and boomer institutions will be releasing their shitty earnings](https://markets.businessinsider.com/earnings-calendar). Keep in mind, a lot of these companies are banks: how has that sector faired this week post-earnings?

The cherry on top: unemployment numbers that will continue to be astronomical. The market hasn't cared the past month when these numbers come out BeCauSe IT;'s PrICED IN- but given that both retail and banking took huge shits this week, along with technicals that will make ur shitty python algo ejaculate, I think we're looking at perfect storm here.

With oil reserves filling up to the brim and a second deal with Opec potentially several weeks away when oil hits new low's it feel like its one-way traffic for oil.

Now, If you hold a position with Etoro x 10 leverage, for example, it pays 10% per day and 25% per weekend... I being completely retarded or is this not basically free money? if the position stays in play a week you cover your position and there is still a significant chance of oil dipping from here.

EDIT - for the record, i am not looking at a 50x leverage, this was an example. I am considering $10,000 on a 10x leverage. which pays $892 per day and $2,677 per weekend

EDIT 2. I have placed these two trades. With a total risk of $2,500. I think this is an excellent value bet, which pays $498 USD per day and $1500 per weekend to remain on

13,Discussion,*Someone* sold emails collected from the old Discord server to spammers,1250,g24tl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g24tl6/someone_sold_emails_collected_from_the_old/,299,1587027143.0,"So I had several accounts in Jtek's WSB discord server, which I signed up with throwaway emails unique in my domain. Guess what. They all just got spammed with [this](https://i.imgur.com/tl1dcWI.png). Note: that email was only used for a discord account that only joined the old server and did nothing else.

How did they collect these emails? The discord invite link that used to be on the sidebar asked permission to authorize a discord app to have access to your discord email, before redirecting you to the actual invite link. That way he harvested all of your emails. Check your ""Authorized apps"" in your discord account. [This is what you should see if you joined the server after the sidebar link was changed](https://i.imgur.com/4xNcJz5.png). It's likely if that's the case, you also got the spam email.

I've been asked by mods to not point any fingers, but let's just say it was very likely a former mod.

The fucker completely sold us out, and is milking it as hard as he can.

**Edit 1:** If you live in California, [CCPA](https://www.smartrmail.com/blog/ccpa-email-marketing/) might apply to you. In Europe, GDPR might too. He also violated Discord's [terms of service](https://discordapp.com/terms) since it prohibits ""attempt to obtain passwords or other private information from other members;"" by harvesting emails and IPs.

**Edit 2:** According to Cam, he had no idea that the email list was obtained illegitimately, please do not direct any hate towards him. While he did make the mistake of accepting a random email list without making sure the emails listed were interested, the person who sold him the email list is who we should care the most about right now. Yes, what he did was wrong and maybe even illegal. Cam said a discord account (now deleted) approached him about this. [Here is what he told me](https://i.imgur.com/qSiQ6jI.png). And [here](https://i.imgur.com/QOC7IZ4.png) is his statement in his Discord.

**Edit 3:** This thread is getting so popular I should write a book about it to make money off of autists :\^)

**Edit 4:** Cam also said he got the email list ""a couple of weeks ago or like two weeks ago, hard to remember, I get 100s of messages a day"". ~~So it's likely the former mod started selling us out before he got banned.~~ Nope, check edit 7 later on.

**Edit 5:** Holy shit. [Check this out](https://imgur.com/a/owgqjvB), a conversation between 2 mods from Jtek's server, one of them sent me that.

The mod who sent me that screenshot said then:

> Now the guy who does tech support for the discord is claiming the VM that the bot that collected our info on was hacked.
>
>But still, they harvested our info through shady means.

But was it really hacked, or is that the excuse they're coming up with?

~~**CHANGE YOUR DISCORD PASSWORD. AND IF YOU USED THAT PASSWORD FOR YOUR BROKERAGE ACCOUNT, YOU'RE A DUMBASS, AND CHANGE THAT TOO.** Who knows what they're up to.~~

~~What seems to be implied is that~~

~~1. Initially they collected usernames and passwords~~
~~2. Eventually they changed the method to just link their app to your discord account and collected your email~~

Later edit: according to one of their staff members, they only got usernames and emails

**Edit 6:** Thank you all for the support guys. I'm now announcing my very own [WSB championship](https://wsb.gg/championship). Please sign up now as spots are limited. More details to be announced soon.

**Edit 7:** [I found a guy who was creating daily accounts and joining that Discord server because he kept getting banned daily, so we discovered the email list includes all emails up until April 8th (maybe 9th).](https://i.imgur.com/c602xix.png) **Which means he started selling these emails immediately after he got banned.** Not before.

**Edit 8:** [Here](https://imgur.com/a/80WLtNG) are the conversations they had back then about this. They *knew*. Also, it's possible they never collected passwords, but only usernames and emails. That's if they always used that method. It's still unconfirmed.

**Edit 9:** Jartek and other admins started to remove mods from the server to try to curb the leaks. Most mods have turned against them already and saved every bit of incriminating evidence. I'm collecting them and publishing them here whenever we find something juicy.

**Edit 10:** [I'd like to announce my new book](https://i.imgur.com/3QDbY4h.png). And with that, I'm out of ideas on how to make money off of you guys. Does anyone know someone who can give me some fresh new ideas? Perhaps someone experienced in this area?

**Edit 11:** They have started to remove even more mods from their discord to curb the leaks and anyone criticizing them. They've also spent a lot of time deleting all incriminating evidence from the mod chats. Nothing to hide, huh.

**Edit 12:** I'd like to announce my latest money making scheme: since I don't have nearly as much time as others to setup a Discord server to steal your information, [fill out this spreadsheet with it to save me some time](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZwV7ay_fU7y3NagkjNj3Dl4Ay0qwlcMRfEyOvoCjJyQ/edit#gid=0) and I pinky promise I'll only use it to make money.",2020-04-16 04:52:23,-0.989,-0.6486,0.08132811650485441,-0.5187572944983818

And even with brr it's still trending up, you people talking about hyperinflation are extremely retarded.

Protesters have been [chanting outside the Ohio state house](https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-dewine-protest-end-social-distancing-reopen-economy-coronavirus) for a couple of days now, blaming the local health department officials for keeping the state closed and calling for it to open back up. What's my takeaway here? We all know lots of folks are in denial and we have been expecting our puts to print as the bad news keeps hitting, but the market keeps going up. The reality is, many folk haven't been hit hard by illness of friends dying, partly because of social distancing and all the state closures. Yet many have been hurt by furloughs, layoffs, and pay cuts. Many still agree with the president's sentiment to open back up, and feel it will happen. Short term, this is why calls are printing, and long term, this is probably why puts will print. People think the worst is over and that once the states reopen, things will go back to normal. Of course, they won't, so there's still more shock to come.

It's sitting at a multi-year low (around $1.60) due largely to us being in a shoulder season for heating/cooling demand combined with 'rona shitshow 2020 tanking industrial demand. All that being said prices are expected to rise towards the end of the year as the oil crash curtails oil production (and associated natty gas production) in the US. It's hard to say when prices will spike but I expect things to be volatile in the next couple of months. 

Coming to this week's play. Natural gas storage numbers are announced tomorrow at 10:30 ET and the EIA is expecting a big injection (storage build). With this much uncertainty in the market I expect a big swing (at least 5%) either way tomorrow. If the build is more than expected we might be breaking a multi-year support and breakout hard to the down side. If it's smaller than expected we'll likely head up to at least the 1.7 level.

This is for 4/14-4/15. I’m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.



Well, I'm gonna open this one with a little fuck you. I hope you assholes have been actually following these summaries because guess what? Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) did exactly what I said it would. I made 190% gains on that play. Today, Lakeland Industries (LAKE) jumped in the morning netting me and a few people that invested with me (I've got the DM's to prove it) a 210% gain on them. I can't promise you'll make money following my advice but I've been 100% right this week. So on to the DD I suppose.



After [reading this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g13vq0/buy_calls_on_echostar_sats_buying_now_is_the/) about Echostar (SATS) and doing a little of my own research I know that they are gonna be a good move. Echostar owns HughesNet which is satellite internet for areas where there are no fiber optic cables and other internet lines are shit. These plans that HughesNet sells all have data caps that run out surprisingly quickly. We upgraded our plans multiple times over the few months that we used them. With earnings coming out on 5/13, I expect HughesNet to have made quite a bit over the last two months in upgrades alone not taking into account the people that switch from their shitty provider to get slightly less shitty service through HughesNet. As we all know, internet usage is up by a lot so this is a reasonable thing to expect. Also, In 2021 SATS is launching another satellite, called Jupiter-3, which will allow them to offer higher download speeds. Overall they seem to be a stable company that isn't going away anytime soon. For more info about their cash on hand (which is quite a bit) and their debt, look at their 10-K from last quarter. This is a play that I plan to make.



Now [this one is probably my favorite](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1blor/this_has_to_work/) for the time being. Hasbro (HAS) is expected to go up after earnings come out on 4/29. The OP of the original post lays it all out perfectly;

* Everyone is sitting at home just trying to get their kids to leave them alone for five minutes. Go to Target and look at the toy aisle. Hasbro. Go look at board games. If they're not sold out, almost all the big boys are Hasbro (Monopoly, MTG, Clue, Sorry, etc). Too lazy to leave the house? Go on Amazon. Not only does Hasbro own the majority of the first few pages of results for toys and board games, they barely have any inventory left.

This stuff is sold out despite the supply chain being back up and running three weeks ago according to the CEO. Everyone is buying board games and their Hasbro gaming brands (all the board games) and Franchise brands (Monopoly, Magic: The Gathering, Nerf, etc.) make up quite a bit of their sales. With all of this stuff flying off the shelves, this is gonna be a good quarter for them. Now according to the OP, Mattel (MAT) is their closest competitor and they release earnings on 4/23. If they report higher earnings from this quarter then expect Hasbro to absolutely crush their earnings because they are much more diversified and just a larger company. They are sitting around 70 right now but I think 80-90 are decent strikes for at the earliest 5/1. I'm gonna go with the OP of the original post and say mid-may is best for expiry.

Edit; MAT changes earnings release to 5/5 so leave them out of it.



So, Yelp (YELP) is fucked. For a lot more in-depth look [check out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1ltpo/yelp_the_sick_company_of_the_tech_industry/) but I’ll get into it a bit here. The majority of their revenue comes from ads and that's not good when companies are worried about not going under instead of marketing their shit. They are laying off 1000 employees with another 1000 being furloughed. Pageviews have dropped between 64% and 83% across the board because no one is fucking going out. It's not rocket science. They have been in the process of dying for a long time and this virus is just going to expedite the process. Their next earnings call is 5/14 so that is when I would expect the biggest drop if not in the days before in anticipation of the drop. I know advocating for puts right now is scary. We all have PTSD from the fuckening a couple of weeks ago so I understand the hesitancy. I'm going to do more research and really see if this is a good idea as we approach earnings a month away. Still, this is definitely something to watch.



That's what I've got for you this time. Its a lot less when I only have two days especially when I have to wade through the chest-high shit river that is this Wallstreetbets. Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

TLDR; I was right assholes, Echostar goes up, Hasbro goes up, Yelp goes down, write more good DD.

My puts are still down ~33% (compared to ~60% earlier in the week) but trending in the right direction today obviously.

But I’m also half tempted to be a pussy and cash out on a day like this.

ESports betting is exploding in popularity and people are even gambling on (and watching) [Madden simulations](https://www.oddsshark.com/esports/sim-sports/madden-20-odds).  I thought I had seen peak degeneracy playing in underground NYC poker rooms and reading what you dirtbags post on this sub but betting on computer sport simulations takes the cake (then again, it's not that much more fake than this market). No one knows when live sports will come back now that Disney put their mouse cock on the table and forced Dana White to [cancel UFC 249](https://www.kxl.com/disney-steps-in-forces-dana-white-to-cancel-ufc-249/). And despite what Daddy Trump may tell you in his thus far incredibly successful attempts at feeding his leftover viagra to the stock market, it's looking like the only sweaty grunting dudes you're going to be seeing for the time being are in your bedroom.

Through the fog of godawful Big Bang Theory reruns and exciting free Pornhub premium, a hero emerges.  As u/killlthenoise posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0zfh0/wwe_was_deemed_an_essential_business_by_florida/), another fine demonstration of how this country functions took place Monday the WWE was granted essential business status in the state of Florida while, rather coincidentally, [Linda McMahon spearheads](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/linda-mcmahon-2020-america-first-trump-super-pac-1368075) one of the largest Trump super-PACs out there. I’m not here to bitch about the transparent shadiness here (tons of subreddits out there for that), I’m just trying to make some money so my cat isn’t seized by ETrade during a margin call. The WWE isn’t sports per se but it will scratch an itch that many people have as long as that itch isn't related to chlamydia.  Fans, even the casual ones, will watch because barely anyone's releasing new content even tangentially related to live sports unless you're a fan of Nicuraguan soccer or Russian ping pong (these are legit the last two live sports my book has listed).  Degens will watch because while mine doesn't, some sportsbooks are starting to take bets on WWE matches, especially since spoilers will be tough to come by with just a skeleton crew working these events. People are starved for some kind of live-ish entertainment and with no competition, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity for them to attract some new eyeballs.

The WWE Network hasn't been the runaway success they expected when they launched it a few years ago but they're making 265 million dollars a year from NBC for airing Raw, 205 million per year from Fox for Smackdown and, incredibly, 50 million per year from Saudi Arabia for hosting a few shows there.  Revenues are pretty much locked in besides gate which isn't a major part of their business model,  competition is as low as it'll ever be and costs are plummeting.  [From today](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2886744-wwe-announces-future-roster-cuts-executive-pay-cuts-amid-covid-19-pandemic): ""The Company's reductions of employee compensation and headcount result in an estimated monthly savings of $4 million along with cash flow improvement of $140 million primarily from the deferral in spending on the Company's new headquarters.""

Let's touch on a few possible downsides.  [The XFL folded last week](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/xfl-shuts-down-no-plans-return-2021-1289777) which is a shame because they were actually making some good strides this year and made gambling on games easier than ever (RIP  NY Renegades, we hardly knew ya).  The XFL is run by a separate company than WWE so it shouldn't affect the company.  The overlap is just the founder and apparently Vinny Mac was prepared to take a [375 million dollar loss](https://fanbuzz.com/xfl/vince-mcmahon-xfl-investment/) in the first three years of the league.  Losses will still be painful for year one, possibly even worse than the ones you're experiencing on your John Holmes-esque portfolio of SPY puts, but not as bad as they would have been had the league been planning for year two right now, and that's not even considering the possibility they had insurance to the tits [like Wimbledon did](https://www.liveinsurancenews.com/wimbledons-pandemic-insurance-will-pay-141-million-for-cancellation/8549427/) (they basically bought puts on themselves; wish there was a way for me to do that).  Vinny offloading 15% of his stock a month ago initially concerned me but on closer inspection he did the [same in 2018](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2809196-vince-mcmahon-sells-around-23m-in-wwe-stock-around-1-of-stake-in-company) when they were opening the XFL to free up some cash for his other venture; odds are he was doing the same here after they closed up shop.  I have heard the possibility raised that they filed for bankruptcy so they could get some of that sweet freshly printed government money.  Also doesn't hurt that Vince got a [sweetheart deal](https://deadline.com/2020/03/vince-mcmahon-sell-15-wwe-stock-1202892214/) to sell his stock, because of course he did, but he kinda still owns it now.

While most stocks have rebounded huge during this latest face-ripping rally, WWE stock is still trading around 1/3 of it's price a year ago when it was $99.25, and much of that drop was due to a [January shakeup](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-30/wwe-plunges-after-earnings-slump-and-company-sacks-management) that saw them replace some of their top execs.  I could go into technicals on the company and the stock but I know most of you are just skipping down to the bottom for a strike anyways so fuck it, let's make some cash...just make sure you declare it all so [Irwyn R. Schyster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNCy9_DU8I4) doesn't come looking for you.

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOK ladies and retards.

We've all read countless DD posts from other TA guys, so now I'm going to give you my take.

*WE WILL START THE NEXT LEG DOWN SOON* *If not this week then the next.*

**I HAVE 3 REASONS WHY:**

1. **JPOWS PRINTER IS GOING TO RUN OUT OF INK:** this is my only fundamental thought process. Yes, the fed has made it clear that they will do literally anything to keep the markets afloat. Rumors of businesses opening up by May 1st. **ARE YOU GUYS FUCKING RETARDED.** This isn't a fucking game COVID-19 is the most devastating thing that could possibly happen to this economy. It's being propped up on low volume and FOMO and soon we'll see the effects of this. **OIL** is in the fucking shitter. OPEC wasn't a failure but it also wasn't not a failure. Catch my drift? **EARNINGS** yeah we saw what happened today with JPM and WFC.... complete and utter retardation. You guys know the rest...this shit is what everybody talks about.  
 
2. **THE BASICS:**

* **VOLUME:** ever since we saw the first big rally off of the lows, we've been experiencing decreasing volume. This is especially true in the past week. This is a telltale sign that the ascending wedge and descending wedge are coming to fruition. The market is running out of steam and soon it will fall again.
* **VOLATILITY:** For the most part going on I don't expect to see any more circuit breakers until the summer when we begin to see the effects of COVID on credit and bond markets as well as Q2 earnings. I do, however, believe that VIX is going to rise in the near future. I don't think it'll get to what it was at in March, but it will go up. Here's a crayon drawing to show you why.   
 

[descending wedge on $vix](https://preview.redd.it/afxbyaqddzs41.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb5db2461c49b40171a3229ad9c89171d87599bd)

1. **ASCENDING WEDGE:** make fun of me all you want but this shit is tried and true. I don't give a shit about you gay bulls talking about *JPOWS printer* and a *Black Swan Event.* Both of these things are glaringly obvious but they don't discount the natural movements of markets.

if you don't know what this is.... look it up :D

-Contributing Background Factors Developing During the 1920s Leading to Prolonged “Great Depression”:

     1- High Consumer Debts - Spending by average Americans of the 1920s artificially pumped up the economy (and inflated stock 
prices) because many purchases made on overextended credit. Most Americans do not have savings to “ride out” hard times.

     2- Over Production on Farms & in Factories – Too many products grown/made & not enough buyers with “real” money.

    3-Lack of Government Regulation- Laissez-Faire approach allows the stock market, banks & consumers to get “out of control”.

  4- High Tariffs – U.S. Government attempts to “protect” American businesses during the 1920s with high tariffs (taxes on imports). 
Foreign countries retaliated with high tariffs on US products. The possibility of selling surplus goods overseas reduced.


1929 Stock Market “Panic” of October 1929 Catalysts were:

   -Panicked Investors (many of whom bought stocks on credit) Sell at Low Prices to recover some cash

   -Potential New Investors Lose Confidence in the Stock Market.

   -Less New Stock Investments

   -Less $ for “Publicly Traded” Bigger Businesses.

  -Big Businesses Produce & Spend Less.

  -Smaller “Mom & Pop” Businesses That Depend on Bigger Businesses Hurt.

  -Big & Small Businesses Cut Wages or Reduce Employees.

  -Unemployed Workers Cannot Pay Back Bank/Consumer Loans.

  -Bank Loans Not Repaid by Unemployed.

  -Banks That Invested Depositors $ in Stocks Cannot Pay Depositors.
 
  -Many Depositors “Run on Banks” to Cash Out Accounts Leading to More Banks Failures.

  -Depositors at Failed Banks Lose Savings (No government insurance).

-Remaining Banks Nervous and Less Credit Available for New Investment.

 -Less New Spending = More Wage/Job Cuts = Deflation & Long Term Depressed Economy.

Now you degenerates need to become literate and do your own research by digging through the financials of individual companies to figure out which ones will and won't survive this pandemic. Today I'll show you an example of how to do this. Keep in mind this is not financial advise and you shouldn't buy some random puts because some person on the internet said it might print in a week; do your own DD. Ok let's begin

**Inspiration**

It's obvious that small businesses are fucked. PPP and EIDL grants, which is meant to sustain small businesses until they can re-open, is a mess with the vast majority of businesses still not getting the money. Even with these loans, it might give small businesses a month or two of extra cash, it won’t be sustainable if we keep needing to lockdown the economy for the next 18 months until a vaccine is introduced.

So let’s use that fact to see what we should take short positions in. What stock has the most exposure to small businesses? $YELP. Let’s look at a breakdown of their financials for the year ended 2019 from their most recent 10-K. Let’s look at some select pieces of their financials to see how they’re doing.

**10-K Deep Dive**

*Income Statement*

|Revenue|1B (970M from ads, 30M from other)|
|:-|:-|
|Cost of Revenue|62M|
|Operating Expenses|977M (Sales: 500M, Product Dev: 230M, G&A: 135M, Depreciation: 50M)|
|Operating Income|35M|
|Net Income|50M|

Effectively all of their revenue is coming from ads. Another interesting fact here is that for every $1 of revenue they’re getting, they had to spend $0.50 in sales. Let’s take a closer look at where this ad money is coming from.

*Revenue Sources*

|Home & Local Services|35%|
|:-|:-|
|Restaurants|14%|
|Beauty & Fitness|12%|
|Health|10%|
|Shopping|8%|
|Other|21%|

Yelp recently announced on April 9 that 1000 employees are being laid off and 1100 are being furloughed, presumably mostly sales, out of a total of over 6000 employees. Also, in the period between Mar 10 - April 9, it has also seen page views for restaurants drop 64%, nightlife 81%, fitness 73% and beauty 83%. Clearly their revenue's going to be fucked for Q1 and Q2, and won't be recovering for a while.

*Balance Sheet*

|Current Assets|533M (Cash: 170M, Securities: 242M, AC: 107M)|
|:-|:-|
|Total Assets|1B|
|Current Liabilities|134M|
|Total Liabilities|315M (Only LT liability being leases)|
|Stockholders Equity|755M|

They’ve actually come into this crisis with a balance sheet that most public companies can only dream of. They literally have no debt (aside from leases), and ALOT of liquid assets, mostly from the giant influx they received from GrubHub when they sold Eat24 to them for $288M. They’re at no risk of bankruptcy, being able to survive at least 6 months with no revenue without cutting anything back with their liquid assets alone. But this is where the good news ends for $YELP investors.

**Yelp - The Sick Company of the Tech industry**

Here’s their stock performance since their IPO in 2012

[$YELP 2012 - 2020, monthly](https://preview.redd.it/zeenp3nr4xs41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c162aede36deada90444a1adf511cfcf0fa896c4)

Even before COVID-19, their stock price has barely increased since their IPO. Their IPO price was $22 in early 2012. In January 2020, it was trading at around $35, representing an increase of 36% over 8 of the best years in the stock market’s history, especially for tech stocks like Yelp. In comparison QQQ grew by nearly 230% in the same time period.

Yelp was founded in 2004, around the same time as Facebook. If Yelp was going to have an explosive growth period, like what almost every other tech company, they probably would have had it by now after 8 years since their IPO. Instead, this is the kind of growth they’ve been seeing in their 2019 fiscal year.

|Revenue|\+8%|
|:-|:-|
|Operating Income|\+37%|
|Net Income|\-26%|
|Current Assets|\-38%|
|Liabilities|\+215%|
|Stockholders Equity|\-30%|
|EPS|\-16%|

So they’re struggling to grow revenue, especially for a medium-cap technology company. Not only that but their earnings and equity is decreasing in what should have been a great year for small businesses and the economy, signaling that the company is slowly dying. They’ve also given up on international expansion and are focusing on protecting their US market share from Google, and it looks like they’re losing.

It also looks like they’ve also spent an enormous amount of their Eat24 cash last year, but it clearly didn’t go towards growth, so where did it all go?

**Propping up the $YELP share price**

During 2019, Yelp has spent $481M (20% of its Jan 2020 market cap) to buy back 14M shares, 20% of its 71M shares outstanding. For perspective, competitors $GOOG and $TRIP each repurchased less than 2.5% of their shares during the same time period. Instead of using that cash to grow their operations, they’ve been using it to artificially prop up their stock. Now, even with a strong balance sheet, they’re going to need all the liquidity they need to avoid having to shrink their already dying operations, and have announced suspending their stock repurchasing program. It’s pretty easy to see the distortion in the valuation of their stock that’s been caused by their stock manipulation - just look at its P/E ratios compared to its competitors.

Using April 14 prices

|$YELP|37|
|:-|:-|
|$GOOG|26|
|$TRIP|20|
|$NDAQ|22|

Using Jan 1 prices

|$YELP|67|
|:-|:-|
|$GOOG|26|
|$TRIP|34|
|$NDAQ|23|

Seems pretty overvalued to me. Now that they’ve stopped their stock repurchasing, we’ll slowly see $YELP fall towards it’s true fair value.

**Price Target**

They’re not going bankrupt, but this recession / depression will definitely accelerate the death of their operations, a process that started when Google first released Google Reviews. As of right now, it’s worth at least the book value of their equity - a 755M market cap, or $10.50 per share. Another simple way to look at it is to apply the PE ratio of its most similar competitor in terms of size and revenue disruption, $TRIP, which would give it a true value of $10.55. Of course, this is using their balance sheet and earnings from 2019, which has probably already been feeling the effects of the lockdown. Their next earnings call is expected to be 5/14, so we’ll see the real damage then.

**Technicals**

This won't be a true wsb DD without drawing some magic lines on the price charts, so I'll do a brief rundown of what I see from my horoscope.

[$YELP, daily](https://preview.redd.it/ikp9abvp4xs41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b1e57304335852cdef4b5e24c9fd1d6fd24c1f)

$YELP has been roughly following the trends of the stock market as a whole since the crash began, but we’re now starting to see actual price discovery in the market (eg. $AMZN hit a new ATH today). It’s currently in an upwards trend towards $22, which has historically been a strong support / resistance level for the past few years, is the 38% retracement level, and is also their original IPO price. It looks like they will fail to break the $22 resistance, fall through the ascending trendline, and resume plummeting before the end of next week.

**TLDR; Learn to be literate. YELP 15p 8/21**

If I would have started buying calls after this market started surging, I would've made even more.  All the volatility and MACD indicators are working just fine, so use them.  

We all know this thing is probably coming back down.  Might retest the lows, might not.  Might blow right through them.  We don't know, much less when.  So stop trying to predict and when the momentum indicators tell you to, just jump on that wave baby and let it carry you.

Movie theaters are done.  Ditch the normalcy bias you retard, it's the reality of our new world.

Movies, however, are not done.  They'll allow streaming on services like NFLX.  NFLX will allow you to purchase specific movies or they'll probably have a higher tier subscription where you get all the new releases.  Either way, they're going to get way the hell more subscribers and more money out of each of those subscribers.

It feels like January 2019: the market is booming (up 30% in the last month), stocks only go up, there is some weird beerflu going around, but it's no big deal.

Why is that?  Investors are happy.  New cases seem to be declining, and the bottom is in.  Anecdotal evidence from other autists, friends, and family alike all suggest that everyone wants to get in the market.  The past three years of this bull run put the market on easy mode for everyone.  You could have literally rolled dice to pick tickers, and you would get insta profits.  The pussys on the sideline have been waiting for their entry in the market.  The chose the last few weeks to hop on J-Powell's train to tendie heaven, hence the rise in stonk.

It seems like anyone with half a brain knows that corona is actually a bad thing and will have a lasting effect on the world economy.  They are on the sideline.  The only people buying are FOMOing into obvious quarantine plays (AMZN, NFLX, ROKU) and bringing up the whole market on low volume.

The very people supporting our current pump are weak-minded and paper handed.  MMs, hedge funds, the big boys all know this.  We are in for another rug pull. I don't know when, but when your dipshit friend who asked you last week how to do a call option starts panic selling when he sees his first -3% day...F

I think the story goes something like the top is when shoeshine boy asks how to get in the market.  Our shoeshine boy is Cam who is doing a 1000 to 1000000 challenge and the top is 292 tomorrow at 11:34pm.

This week has been a fantastic microcosm of what is going on in the market.

We've seen today that any news of recovery or news of opening the country rallies the market incrementally (drug release and plan for opening today). 

Likewise, we've also seen that banks earnings are all rotten, and banks have gone down the entire week. Look at JPM for an example, every single day it went down with each release of earnings from its competitors in the banking sector. (same can be said about oil)

despite banking and oil going down all this week, SPY has been going up. Why?

It's because SPY has a majority composition of companies that benefit from the crisis and are in a V shaped recovery. There is a minority of companies that are in an L shaped recovery.

What's the takeaway? FED goes brr, and that has helped get us to this point, but that's not helping banks or oil this week, so it shouldn't be helping tech & healthcare either, yet tech & healthcare are still up this week. In other words, what matters is whether or not a company is well positioned in this particular crisis.

tl;dr 

Close your puts spy holders, you're fucked otherwise. People that use TA on SPY in this crisis without going into analyze SPY's holdings are retarded, or are trying to get your attention for their own benefit

Hello autists. I've had my fair share of gains and losses these past few months, and I'm not going to predict which fucking way the market is going to go because no number of magical voodoo lines on a chart is going to do fuckall to change the market. I know which way the market is going to go as much as the other guy, and literally everyone on this sub is autistic which is to say nobody fucking knows anything.

&#x200B;

**The Current Situation**

Data, however, doesn't lie. [https://www.crystalbull.com/stock-market-timing/Unemployment-chart/](https://www.crystalbull.com/stock-market-timing/Unemployment-chart/)

This chart shows that in 2008, peak unemployment numbers hit 7 months after the bottom of the market. Same thing in 2002, which had about an 8 month gap between the two. Yes, shit is bad out there. Millions are unemployed, poor people can't pay for food, goods, or rent. But that's the thing: the impoverished of the US are the most affected, AKA the smallest portion of the nation's spending power. Two decades of promoting excess and overspending have conditioned Americans to still shop regardless of their financial condition. Many of you are complaining why the market doesn't affect this. It's because everybody **KNOWS** about the job market going to shit. Everybody **EXPECTS**  bad news. Bad news no longer affects the market, good news will cause violent moves upwards. 

&#x200B;

**The Road to Recovery**

Our economy is straight fucked. But we still have a populace that wants to spend money. To prove my point, cruise bookings are up [40% in the last 50 days](https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-ship-bookings-are-increasing-for-2021-despite-coronavirus-2020-4) compared to 2019 bookings. In addition, the destruction to the economy is less than some of the apocalpytics here. [This website shows the average expenditures for Americans.](https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/credit-cards/american-spending-habits.html) 84% of expenditures are necessities. That means the majority of US spending is still intact, and with new stimulus packages incoming it will help bolster this line of spending for a bit more (yes I realize the Fed is completely incompetent but the 1,200 stimulus checks will do *some* good). The phased recovery will bolster the economy even more, as services are slowly reinstated. Yes, more houses will be foreclosed, more businesses shuttered, and more jobs lost. But the economy as a whole will stay intact thanks to JPOW's 12 gauge liquidity minigun. 

&#x200B;

**The Stonk Market**

This is what ya'll actually care about. I have no idea where the stock market is going to go, but I can for sure tell you one thing; the initial stock market drop was fairly mild, with rumors driving price action. The massive increase volatility was mainly caused by the double black swan event (namely world pandemic and oil price war) that destroyed liquidity of major players in the market, forcing them to liquidate position to retain cash (this coupled with algos driving price action caused volatility to spike to 85-levels).  

But liquidity is back. MM's have all the cash they need to survive in this environment, and everyone is on prepared for another downwards spiral.  I see many posts talking about how ""unemployment numbers will drive markets down"" or ""reinfection will drive markets down"". Everybody and their mother knows about the potential for another shutdown, and shit is already priced in. While I'm not disputing the possibility of another downturn, it will not nearly be as violent because the catalysts contributing to high volatility in the initial drop are no longer there (liquidity crisis, unexpected). Everybody expects another downturn, and the fact that it's expected will make investors much more level headed about making trading decisions during a downturn. Short term plays still exist but you'll have to be relying on pure luck to make those plays. If you want consistent gains, LEAPS on stocks at their current bottoms such as CCL, RTX, and bigger bank stocks are great picks and potential 10-baggers in the next few months. Keep cash on hand and don't get burnt by theta by making stupid short term plays. A 10 bagger 3 months down the line is still better than zero next week. 

&#x200B;

**Longer TL;DR: Catalysts for a sharp market downturn are gone, any drop will be slow. The stock market is not indicative of the current economy, but rather the more hopeful future. Don't let theta gang fuck you, make long plays for fat tendies.**",2020-04-17 06:36:05,0.9826,0.0,0.15603888888888884,0.3795462962962963

To his first point. Yes, high temperature and fever is a symptom of Coronavirus. But, it's turning out a lot of people are actually carrying this virus asymptomatically. It doesn't matter though. A lot of governments, companies, and individuals are itching to get back to normal. Do you seriously think large sporting events, conferences, restaurants, and offices are just going to be shut down for the year? Fuck no! The relatively small cost of a few thousand to placate the public and provide false sense of security is well worth the cost. 

&nbsp;

Both the market and public, especially in red/purple states, are eating up the bullshit Donnie is hyping up about America being back to business May 1st. The White House has also released some guidelines about how the businesses can ""safely"" open back up.

Well, why don't companies just buy cheap thermal temperature scanners from China? Besides the [obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt26Wn_XE2I&loop=0), advanced thermal scanners allow companies to scan people more rapidly, accurately and safely.

&nbsp;

Well, why FLIR? Because it's public so you can actually fucking trade it, unlike most other thermal imaging companies. They are also [well-positioned](https://www.flir.com/products/flir-a320/) for the upcoming surge in demand as their products are tailored specifically for testing people. 

&nbsp;

Overall, $FLIR stands well-positioned to profit bigly from governments and companies, whether this virus turns out to be as bad as we 🌈🐻's expect or a giant nothingburger, due to pressure from governments and fear from the general public. 

&nbsp;

One last note: earnings are expected to be released 4/22, premarket. Not that I think bad earnings this quarter will negatively affect the price in this completely irrational bull trap. 

&nbsp;

I yolo'd 20x $40c for 5/15 because they were fucking goddamn cheap. The smart play would be either $35c 5/15 or $50c 7/17 per /u/Vainglory27 's advice

Any other guesses?

Junk bonds were only fetching 4%. There were huge pools of collateralized loan obligations made up of junk rate covenant light leverage loans.Housing prices had outpace growth in income and rents by margins akin to 2005-7. The US government was running a $1T deficit during an expansion, and now it will run a $3.2T deficit.  


But stonks are booming. Even if this shit started to get cured tomorrow, we'd have major swaths shut down through mid-May, and a month of reopening. Unemployment is 12.7% in my state, headed to 20% by early May. Our unemployment insurance trust will run out in 6 weeks at this rate. State and local budgets are shot.  


But we've reinflated to what was already bubble levels. Why?  


All I can think of:  
1. The big risk before was corporate debt. The Fed is basically promising to buy into junk debt and ensure no one can fail.  


2. Because people know inflation won't kick off right away due to all the unemployment, they aren't afraid (yet) that 4-5% inflation turns basically every bond and fixed income security issued from 2009-2020 into negative real yield toxic shit.  


3. As more info comes out, 80% of tax breaks in the stimulus went to people with over $1M incomes. The 10% of households own 88% of all stonks, so they will do the best out of all of this. The rich can pump into the market because they know the government won't let it fail (this also means trillions are being pumped to make sure the top 10% get theirs, even if this means Social Security and Medicare are getting fucked). Fixed income was already shit low and with inflation it will become negative yield. Stonks will at least gain value some day.  


4. Institutions are desperately trying pair losses buying back in for a rally they know won't last.

It is actually quite rational. However, it can act irrational in the short term and can be irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

What people fail to understand is that doing simple math, none of this correction up is extraordinary. It's called reverting back to the mean. We are currently more than 30% up from the bottom which sounds like a shit ton, but we are still only a bit above 50% of the entire correction from the top.In other words, we have retraced a bit above 50% of the entire move from ATH, which is **historically and completely normal.** During the Great Depression, after the initial drop, the Dow retraced almost 50% of that move as well up before eventually breaking the lows.

What people also are ignoring is that we have reached a level of volatility that was never before seen in the history of the entire stock market. Compare the velocity of the last drop to others. It was much, much faster than even the initial drop of the Great depression in the 30s. As such, mathematically, it's completely expected for the retracement to be much higher than people think. Also, given the fact that the downmove was swift, big players entered into massive shorts and puts. This gives the market enough freedom to use those shorts as liquidity to go up in the short term. High panic drops have always resulted in an immediate prolonged correction up or atleast a prolonged period of sideways movement, even if the market continued to go down eventually. Look at history. It has always done this. A good example is the initial drop in the Great Depression as I mentioned above.

Now, here's the thing. Contrary to what your impatient ass thinks, ""short term"" != days. It could mean many weeks or months. Just because your April/May/June puts are expiring worthless doesn't mean that the market is irrational. Fundamental factors will play out, just not in the time period you think it will. This is one of the reasons timing the market is insanely difficult and why most of you are getting their asses handed by options, especially short term ones.

159,DD,Peloton DD,34,g2ryk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2ryk8/peloton_dd/,34,1587114322.0,"First DD post...   Got left bag holding puts after following VS's posts... turns out 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 is not my style.  Hope this helps you make some money back.

Let's talk fundamental of Peloton (PTON).  Yeah, there's only one . New subscribers.  The fucks that have been buying up the stock from it's $17.70 low about 30 days ago to the $38.08 all-time high today think there are going to be a lot of them because the Chinese lab virus is keeping us from doing our bicep curls in the squat rack at Planet Fitness and enjoying a nice pizza afterwards. 

My gf insisted last August that we buy a Peloton bike.  $3,000 later, we have some nice shoes that you can barely walk in and a stationary bike that costs more than a car does per month to run these days.  I use it a few times a week.  It's a good work out and I have a soft spot for Dennis.  

But I digress.  The real problem here is that Peloton's subscriber's are not mooning like some SPY just mainlined JPow tendies.   And I think I have proof to back it up from data made available in Peloton's own API.

I don't know Python very well, so I paid some dude from Sri Lanka $30 on UpWork to write a script to scrape some data from Peloton's website.  Took him like 5 minutes to figure out they have an API that makes this data pretty easy to get if you have any coding experience that goes beyond recording VBA macros.     So he wrote me a script that exports their workout data by workout, going back for all of the workouts they still have on line (\~2016).

Now here's where my first-hand experience comes in to play.  When you first sign up, Peloton pushes  some easy-ass ""Beginner"" workouts, and like a good noob, you do those work outs once or twice before you move on to the real shit.

Check out this history by quarter going back to 2016.  It shows the number of Beginner workouts as a % of total workouts, and Beginner classes as a % of total classes.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ko0k9g96z9t41.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=035a8395128e72fb43d8326a73e4e9737f5c6b36

Notice anything about the % of beginner workouts and classes in that period?  It ain't mooning.  In Q2, they had significant subscriber growth (Christmas), and the beginner workouts over-indexed the beginner classes.  In Q3, for one of only 2 times in the entire history, the % of Beginner classes and % of Beginner workouts were roughly in proportion.  

My simple hypothesis is that if Planet fitness members were truly giving up (which let's be honest, they already did by joining Planet fitness for $10 a month to feel good about having a gym membership), then noobs should be pumping Beginner workouts.  The workout data does not show it.

In a couple of weeks, Peloton is going to report their earnings and also their subscriber growth for Q3.  

Peloton's previously published end-of-year guidance is to hit 930,000 subscribers.  They were at 712k from the last earnings report, and using an exponential growth function because I couldn't find it online, their pre-corona subscribers should be around 833k at end of Q3.

Using some fancy multiple regression against historical subscriber growth, my prediction is that they **MEET** their subscriber growth target, but this will be a **HUGE** disappointment to all of the Wallstreet bros that think Peloton subscriptions are mooning right now due to stay-at-home corona economy.  They will also report HIGHER user engagement, because current Peloton owners are doing more workouts.  But retention and engagement isn't really the play.

TLDR: Peloton subscriber growth will MEET previous guidance, but fall below the consensus analyst estimates for growth, which will be a huge disappointment and send the stock that has ballooned from $17.70 low 30 days ago to $38.08 all-time-high today, spiraling down.

First of all, 125 patients is a tiny sample size. 

Second of all, 2 patients died, which is a 1.6% fatality rate for patients who were probably receiving the best medical care available in the world. Do you really think a UChicago/Gilead funded study will have the same overworked doctors in any other hospital running the trial?

Third of all, and this is huge,THERE IS NO CONTROL GROUP. Seriously? Might as well rub a bat against your face to see if you'll get cured.

This goes back to point number two. We have no way of determining what the fatality rate might be for patients receiving top notch medical care (after all, Gilead has every financial incentive to make this drug look effective), but just a saline infusion instead of Remdesivir. Maybe the fatality rate would be 1.6% for anyone under Gilead's care, whether they received Remdesivir or not.

I'm thinking that the after hours algorithms never took a basic statistics or biology course.

SPY is heavily weighted toward tech stocks which have led the huge rally so far. We've all made insane returns betting that it will continue to go up, but I guarantee people start taking profits tomorrow, especially after hitting ATH's, and will start moving their gains to immensely undervalued companies.

To burst your drug-fueled bubble, and comfort my dying putfolio, this will not save the economy in time.

Even if Gilead can improve their rate of production to the optimistic timeline for at  scale production of 6-8 months, the availability will rapidly gobbled up by those nearest to death and then only to fill up stockpiles before common use. After a month of treating and finally releasing those nearest to death, they'll still have to deal with the surge of impending hospitalizations from anti maskers, and communities even more retarded than wsb. Demand for the drug will either send its price into the stratosphere, or price control measures will ensure that the drug is not available to the average retard for at least a year. 

The point is that until they have a stockpile of remdesivir or a vaccine or tracking, there are no profitable movie theaters, amusement parks, air travel, etc. 

When will there be a stockpile? My complete speculation is that it will take 6-8 months (Gilead's own estimate) to make round one of production, which will not be enough to treat everyone who needs it. Keep in mind that many synthesis steps have to be done by trained professionals with at least bachelor degrees (in fucking organic chemistry jesus), so you can't just throw money at it because there's a shortage of qualified employees for this physically and mentally challenging job. It will takes months more to produce and distribute enough so that the growth in remdesivir reserves match the growth rate of the virus, and perhaps longer to surpass it.

Lets look at the facts:

Lockdown started for >90% of states in mid March.

April rent was due end of March, the poor schmucks labeled as non-essential, literally millions of them, all could barely afford that.

Throughout April those same people are going to run up their credit cards just trying to survive. 

Stimulus checks got in, they can pay May rent (assuming the banks don't just immediately deduct the stimulus to pay off pre-existing debt due to them).

In May, those same, poor idiots max out their credit cards and start living off of unemployment exclusively. Not their fault, just trying to stay off the streets.

Unless *another* stimulus check arrives **before the end of May**, nobody will be able to afford rent. Spending on just about everything will drop drastically. JPow can dump all the trillions he wants into the big banks but the fact is that those same banks will be losing huge amounts of revenue come beginning of June.

A Federal Reserve Bank will lend up to $600 billion to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which will in turn purchase participations in either new loans under the Main Street New Loan Facility (MSNLF) or upsized tranches of existing loans under the Main Street Expanded Loan Facility (MSELF).

The SPV will purchase a 95% participation in MSNLF loans and MSELF upsized tranches at par value (the remaining 5% must be maintained by the Lender). The SPV and the Lender will share risk on a MSNLF loan or a MSELF upsized tranche on a pari passu basis.

**Eligible Lenders -**

U.S. insured depository institutions, U.S. bank holding companies, and U.S. savings and loan holding companies. 

**Eligible Loans -** 

***Main Street New Loan Facility***: provides funding for an unsecured term loan that (i) was originated on or after April 8, 2020, (ii) has a minimum loan size of $1 million and a maximum loan size that is the lesser of (a) $25 million or (b) an amount that, when added to the Borrower’s existing outstanding and committed but undrawn debt, **does not exceed 4x EBITDA.**

***Main Street Expanded Loan Facility***: provides funding for an upsized tranche of an existing term loan that was originated before April 8, 2020. The upsized tranche must have a minimum loan size of $1 million and a maximum loan size that is the lesser of (a) $150 million, (b) 30% of the Borrower’s existing outstanding and committed but undrawn bank debt, or (c) an amount that, when added to the Borrower’s existing outstanding and committed but undrawn debt, **does not exceed 6x EBITDA.**

If any collateral secures an upsized tranche (whether that collateral was pledged under the original terms of the underlying loan or at the time the loan was increased by the upsized tranche), the collateral will secure the participation on a pro-rata basis.

**Key Loan Terms -**

The following terms apply to both MSNLF loans and MSELF upsized tranches:

1. ***Term****.* Four-year maturity.

2. ***Interest Rate***. Adjustable-rate of Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 2.50 – 4.00%.

3. ***Principal and Interest Payment Deferral***. Both principal and interest will be deferred for one year.

**TL;DR -**

The Federal Reserve will take 95% of the repayment risk for loans between 1 and 150 Million USD; with principal and interest Deferred for 1 year. This program can be acronymized as F-MSELF.

Updates and gains,17,g2njn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2njn2/surviving_coronavirus_with_jd_updates_and_gains/,11,1587099647.0,"\~3 Weeks ago, I made a post -  [Surviving coronavirus with JD. Doing the research so you don't have to](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fne6fx/surviving_coronavirus_with_jd_doing_the_research/), and wanted to share a brief update on JD and inspiration for gains.

As China has successfully managed to lift their quarantine, and the rest of the world settles in for a protracted lockdown, investments in Chinese companies are looking more attractive. [JD.com](https://JD.com) is one of the few companies that managed to successfully navigate the coronavirus lockdown in China (demonstrated through revenue growth and surging demand), and has little exposure to the rest of the world (aside from retail and e-commerce in SE Asia, which is an asset during lockdown). With many days of negative S&P and positive JD, an [upgrade from Morgan Stanley](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/upgrades/20/04/15808492/benzingas-top-upgrades-downgrades-for-april-15-2020), and ongoing Chinese recovery, JD will continue to be in the news more frequently, and more investors will appreciate the growth play that it represents.

&#x200B;

**Dangerous political environment:** 

\- Number of countries, with [leadership from the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/08/coronavirus-crisis-is-turning-americans-both-parties-against-china/) and the UK, are increasingly blaming China for coronavirus and calling for severe economic punishment. Although this is highly unlikely in the middle of a pandemic where China is the only country where factories are actually working, it is highly likely that politicians will attempt to shift blame from their own missteps during the crisis, and take a more confrontational stance towards China.   
\- A the same time, China continues appalling levels of cover-up, on everything from [not disclosing the emerging pandemic quickly enough](https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9), to [manipulating number of cases/deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html), to [hiding the origin of the virus, and attempting to shift blame for the virus away from itself (and blaming the US)](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/30/beijing-coronavirus-response-see-what-sticks-propaganda-blame-ccp-xi-jinping/). China is also aggressively pushing an internal disinformation/censorship campaign and an international PR/propaganda campaign to [pitch themselves as saviors and use this pandemic to obtain further influence on the international arena](https://thehill.com/policy/international/490719-china-sees-chance-to-expand-global-influence-amid-pandemic).  
\- These two trends are likely to result in further major confrontation with likely economic consequences between the US and China, if not other countries. And with Trump being up for re-election this year, he will do everything to shift blame away from his poor handling of the pandemic and conduct a grand theater of ""punishing China"" to appease his supporters  
\- Given the above, it is possible that US may take draconian actions towards China in the Summer/Fall timeframe, after the crisis becomes more manageable. No one knows what these actions will be, but they may include further sanctions of individuals/companies, tariffs, restriction of access to the financial markets, more aggressive support to move certain supply chains (such as pharmaceutical production) out of China, and more restrictions on Chinese companies for access to US capital markets (partly due to [LK and TAL fraud scandals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2020/04/10/china-stocks-face-increased-scrutiny-after-tal-education-and-luckin-coffee-reveal-inflated-sales/#4a2373f2d51b))

&#x200B;

**Takeaway:**  
\- JD represents a great growth opportunity, but will be impacted by the shifting political winds, likely around when the pandemic starts winding down in the US/most of Europe (which will not happen for at least a month)

\- JD will have their next earnings on \~5/8, and they had announced an ""at least double digit"" YoY revenue growth. I expect they will meet the minimum 10% mark, and they will be one of the few companies during this earnings season that will have positive YoY quarterly growth and full-year guidance

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer:** 

The earnings season will be bad, with likely misses and lowered guidance across the board, which may drag down JD in the short/medium-term. However, it is encouraging that JD is often outperforming S&P 500.

Although this is still a longer-term, high growth play (200-300% in 1-2 years, with right positions), with a potential for a shorter term high profits through the earnings season, you should be very careful to not get caught up in a US-China spat. 

Always remember, the advice you see on here is enthusiasts sharing their opinion, and should NOT be taken as a credible financial advice, especially if you don't know what you're doing. Liquidate your account, uninstall Robinhood, sign up for an actual brokerage, talk to a financial advisor (most of them will do it for free), and take online courses before you start throwing money away.

\- Jan 15 2021 $45 Calls (Moderately Risky)

\- Jan 21 2022 $55 Calls (Moderately Risky)

\- Pay attention to US-China and US-World politics to unwind JD positions before things escalate in the Summer

Looks like remdesivir will have positive results from the studies that are pending release this month. We can talk about vaccines all we want, but they're at minimum 12 months away. This will be the first therapy that has RCT data backing it up.

We will see a pump by Donnie touting the success of big, beautiful, American pharma baby Gilead. I mention this in a comment below, but GILD has been constantly overlooked because the naysayers claim this won't be a big profit generator for them. The truth is: **it doesn't fucking matter**. Look at all these other companies that won't have the same levels of revenue for years to come. It's not about the bottom line anymore, but hype and time in the limelight.

Positions: [GILD 6/19 85c](https://i.imgur.com/I5CJ5ht.jpg). 6/19 to leave enough room for the US remdesivir results.

Edit: closed at 76 today, AH now at 85. Is GILD mooning the entire market? Dunno.

Edit2: for those that missed this, I would honestly buy puts on GILD, maybe 85p. GILD always, always, always, has a tendency to slide down soon after good news.

You can read up the report by yourself, but I don’t want to repeat anything in this report and want to tackle this problem in another way. My DD is a surface level proof to Citron’s report. 

2020 has not been a good year for GSX. It should have because stay at home order should have boosted their business. But short report come out twice for them and apparently they are getting [sued by VIPKID](https://cj.sina.com.cn/articles/view/1887344341/707e96d502000v34a?cre=tianyi&mod=pcpager_fintoutiao&loc=1&r=9&rfunc=3&tj=none&tr=9) for unethical acts and hacking yesterday asking for 8 million RMB (1.13 Million USD). 

The interesting thing I am seeing is some clear act of fraud just on the surface. 

Go into their website, you can see all the free classes have a number indicating how many people are signed up. But all the paid classes is not showing a number.

If you check a lot of the classes you will see most of them are having this little text, it is always 1-5 spots left. What are the chances most of them have so few spots left so you can join now or never? 

Another very interesting thing is their app on AppStore. (This is a Chinese AppStore account)

You can see there are a lot of different usernames comment the exact same long review 1 year ago. So goes for the untrustworthy 4.8 start review.

Now let’s talk about the [CEO](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%88%E5%90%91%E4%B8%9C/55090). He recently tweeted on Weibo about the situation. If you know Chinese, or use Google Translate on image, you can see what he is saying. He is basically saying none of these is making sense. But he did not give any solid number or arguments. All he said is a very emotional: No that’s all bullshit. You guys are so arrogant you don’t even know what we are doing. 

I don’t know what you think but my gut feeling is that he don’t have anything concrete to show.

Besides this He also replied with other [emotional messages](https://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/968093.htm). 

A semi famous Chinese writer also has written a response to the CEO. What this says is basically: if you have concrete earnings, them US shorting you is a great opportunity for you, just go ahead and buy your own stock. Why do you so eagerly go on Weibo and streaming rants trying to say they are wrong instead of taking this opportunity? 

He also explained they are expanding to a very small market (I don’t know what that is) right now, an act of desperation.

An example from Chancellor Merkel's press conference yesterday:

The basic reproduction number R0 indicates how many people an infectious person infects on average. Germany currently has an R0 of 1.0 and one of the most advanced health care systems in the world.

If the R0 number were to increase by only 0.1 points to 1.1, the German health care system would already reach the limit in October when it comes to the care of intensive care patients. With a reproduction factor of 1.2, this point would already be reached in July, with a factor of 1.3 already in June.

If countries were to start opening up their economies quickly, infection rates would skyrocket. Afterwards, however, it would take 2-3 weeks to bring the infection rate back down to 1.0.

According to one of my colleagues: ""We have been talking about this for over 10 years, seems like they have three options:

1. Hold Forever (let them roll-off at maturity, but the Treasury will have to pay the interest and principal to the Fed that then pays it back to the treasury, until maturity, unless they decide to forgive the debt, which I thought the Japanese would have done to their Central Bank by now);
2. Monetize the debt by creating inflation (which they have been doing for decades, the CPI does not fully reflect the true inflation rate, which has been double or triple what the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, this gives them the luxury of printing more money, but with no real effect on real GDP or wages or standards of living; and
3. slowly or quickly unloading the securities into the market under a QT-Quantitative Tightening scenario, which they did twice over the past decade (2016/2018) and the markets convulsed and corrected quickly after facing liquidity issues.

According to their model, all else being equal, the projected % increase in allowance for loan loss is:

1st Mortgage:
15% Unemployment = 62% Increase
20% Unemployment = 124% Increase

HELOCs:
15% Unemployment = 14% Increase
20% Unemployment = 53% Increase

Autos:
15% Unemployment = 31% Increase
20% Unemployment = 45% Increase

Business Secured:

All the small businesses we're supposed to be helping are either closed, going out of business, or no one wants to buy from them for fear of getting beer virus.

I think people are either going to:

1. Buy stuff from Amazon, which literally only helps Amazon and no one else
2. Get a couple of meals delivered from chains like Chipotle or McDonalds
3. Use it to pay for basic necessities like rent and groceries, which will be the most helpful of all these, but still only helps a small minority.

230,DD,NUGT,17,g2jxoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2jxoj/nugt/,38,1587088577.0,"The movements of NUGT x2 ETF roughly follow VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX). However, because NUGT is x2 leveraged and resets everyday it has higher volatility and is mostly meant for day trading. That said, there are periods where NUGT can be swing traded for larger periods of time depending on certain circumstances which I will describe below. First, however, we need to understand the current context of the gold market and how GDX is relevant.

Over the last several months, the gold market has been booming, going from the low 1500/oz  in 11/19 to the 1700/oz today (Fig.1). In mid-late March, gold dropped from these highs all the way back to the 1500 range for a short period before spiking back up rapidly (Fig. 2). This drop was caused by people selling their profitable gold positions to cover margin calls and other losses related to the COVID-19 crash. Simply put, stonks went down, a lot of people lost money, so they sold their gold to quickly recover from the losses. As you can see, gold has already returned to its highs and it will continue to grow. My speculation is that it will reach 2020 by the end of 2020.

&#x200B;

[Fig. 1 - Gold Trend\/6 Months](https://preview.redd.it/qxez17ils7t41.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=e046cc6be73bb0932febdab60bb283cfd358408d)

&#x200B;

Now, GDX roughly tracks the NYSE Gold Miners Index, which unsurprisingly has a trend which resembles that of actual gold. Gold goes up, gold mining goes up. Look at GDX's portfolio to get a better idea of their investments: [https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/gdx/portfolio](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/gdx/portfolio)

Like anything else, GDX has crashed from the COVID-19 pandemic, and like gold, it recovered very quickly to its previous levels, and is most likely to continue pushing into the territory of all-time highs. This is where things get interesting.

As I said earlier, NUGT roughly follows GDX, but with much greater short-term volatility. Because of its volatility, NUGT will sometimes reach price points that do not accurately represent the price of GDX. Whenever this happens, i.e., whenever the price difference between NUGT and GDX exceeds roughly 25%, a correction occurs, resulting in a rapid change in NUGT to match GDX. Inherently, NUGT wants to be as close as possible to GDX, but because of its volatile nature, it sometimes goes astray too far, and when this happens, it corrects itself. Below (Fig. 3) I have indicated some of those price points.

Today, NUGT is trading at about $11, but GDX is at about $30. That is about a 60% price difference, far greater than any of the other points indicated. Moreover, GDX is likely to continue rising in suit with gold. Therefore, I believe NUGT is going to experience another correction in the near future that will bring it closer to the $30 range. That is the conclusion that I have reached about its price movement.

The authorities had argued that restrictions were necessary to stabilize stock prices.

The one-month bans were introduced in March and were set to expire in the next few days. The regulators cited plunging stock prices as markets reacted to the coronavirus scare and its implications for the economy. The new restrictions will be in place until May 18 and could be extended further, the authority said.

I gotta say my experience is not great so far, there are far more bugs in the app then I expected and way way more bugs then I'd like to have for an app where I am moving actual money around. As far as I can tell there is no way within the app to move money between TFSA and a personal account I would like to so that I can day trade and not get in trouble with the CRA for day trading on a TFSA. The website says you can do that on the computer but when I log into the computer I see a totally different account then the one on my phone. I ended up accidentally moving $400 into a general purpose savings account on the computer which I can not buy and sell stocks from and I cant see that money on my phone which has a separate $200 for day trading.

The numbers on the phone are ping ponging all over the place. I currently have - $172 available for trading for some unknown reason. I bought 50 shares of one stock and it currently shows me having 100 shares. I can't tell if I am up or down because the share count if off and the app thinks I doubled my investment overnight.

I was watching one stock yesterday that was showing a %1700 increase. It was roughly $6 in value and had only gone up a few cents but the app thought the stock price went from less then a dollar to over $6 even though the 52 week low was $5 not $0.35.

The site above is tracking all cases of CV in the world. There's been past speculation on this sub that the IHME model isn't very accurate. Looking at the recent data, that statement could be correct. Daily deaths from April 14 and 15th broke RECORDS for number of deaths per day. 

The argument currently is that deaths are a lagging indicator. Fair to say. But we're having another problem as well: cases shot back up yesterday for the US, up 3,000 from the previous day. If I had to guess, Easter saw a lot of people coming together, and starting yesterday those people began experiencing the symptoms of CV.

Quick aside: we've all been aware of the fact that cases miraculously decline on saturdays and sundays over this whole timeline. Is it because cases are coming down, or are labs simply having part of their workforce take the weekend as per normal work week schedules, thus reducing testing capacity?

This is not just the US either. Look at Spain's data. Yesterday they had 6,599 newly reported cases. Last time their new case numbers were that high? April 4.

I'm no scientist, or statistician, but I make my money on looking at the real data and not just taking the narrative's word for it. And these new numbers are severely deviating from the consensus view of how the virus is declining.

I find it implausible that when we open the country back up we will continue to see cases level off or decline when the data is currently suggesting in a full lockdown America is struggling to see new cases decline. Taking the Easter weekend as a potential reason for new case spikes, it is worrisome to see the country trying to open up when clearly this virus comes back so easily.

I will of course disclaimer that I am not a scientist or a statistician, and if anyone with more expertise would have some rectification for these deviations from expected outcomes of case spread, I would welcome the correction.

However lets look at the numbers.

The average salary in the USA is around $56k; broken down that is $1150 USD a week.

Unemployment benefits pay you half of your income, so normally on unemployment you would be making $575. However, with the extra $600 weekly to UI benefits you would be making $1175, actually more than what you would be making working.

Now, not everyone makes $56k. Actually over 60% of people in the USA make LESS than $56k. This means that 60% of people in the USA are actually being paid more on unemployment than their actual jobs. So in reality; unemployment numbers = 60% of those people are getting more capital than the jobs they are leaving for the next few months. This is actually a conservative estimate since most of the people losing their jobs seem to be retail and hospitality which are around or below this $56k threshold",2020-04-16 15:38:50,-0.945,-0.4404,-0.11026400000000004,-0.4985546666666667

Stocks go up, as resources go down. Shit is rigged because I bought puts, with that aside I think I've been wrong in my thinking. 

I've been trying to think of possible resilient emerging technology, or areas that may get more traffic due to the pandemic. But I never stopped to think like a boomer. The creatures that make up the lion's share of stock trading. 

I think of the initial market sell of in February and wonder to myself : ""Why not December, or January, why February 20?""

A key factor here is that boomers are old, bold, and waycist to the bone. They could care less about Genocide, Violence, Slavery or Disease in other foreign third world countries. But the moment one of the Mario brothers got sick, the boomers sold off. This is a mark where white people, the most important people according to every depiction of wall street I've ever seen, think shit has hit the fan and can no longer ignore the problem. 

Fast forward to now, we're back to December 2019. The world is set for a recession, a big one, huge one, bigger than we've ever had, yet people are still investing. What could cause people to feel the effects of the virus or economic downturn and stop living in la la land?

For me, I think the biggest boomer idea is not related to the virus, or economics, but rather big government or the fear of martial law and chaos. I think this is the one wild card boomers may care about, where they think that the world is going to be taken over by the ""elites"" and that the government is going to make them more subservient. 

I think if more states enforce strict lock downs like Michigan, or the lock down lasts longer than people think it should, its likely for protests to occur. This could cause more panic and more fear towards others or the government. 

From this turmoil I think boomers will be scared to invest and instead hoard as we descend into a police state because they can't go to church anymore. 

For me, I'm trying to make money off of boomer fear by buying into AOBC (Guns and defense), but I'm not sure what else may be profitable. **AOBC $9 Call 09/18** personally.

One thing is for certain, this market moves more on emotion than logic, and for that reason I'm trying to think like a boomer.

I know what you're thinking, why would anyone touch CCL without a ten-foot pole? Hear me out, CCL is already more than 70% down from its all-time high of this past year. It has pretty much absorbed most bad news and expectations for people to go on cruises are already low. The slightest good news pumps this stock up as you probably have seen from earlier this week. I am going to tell you why I think CCL has seen the worst of its pain:

\-People have short-term memory for markets. People will still go on cruises, they may not go immediately after lockdown but many people are still booking and taking advantage of rare deals offered by the cruise lines. Don't believe me? Check out r/cruise \- lots of people are booking through major cruise lines like Carnival.

\-Despite the outbreak, bookings are up. ""CruiseCompete.com has seen a 40% increase in bookings for 2021 over the last 45 days, with only 11% of those from customers with trips canceled.""  Only 11% were rebookings. ""In an analysis of the cruise industry, Swiss banking giant UBS wrote that cruise booking volume for 2021 was up 9% in the last 30 days compared with the same time last year"" and ""Booking volume was even higher for trips to Asia and Alaska."" It appears that people are not scared of going internationally. Hell, speaking anecdotally, one of my own friends went on a cruise during heightened fears of the Coronavirus last month. Plus, in the current atmosphere, it actually is cheaper compared to international travel vacation via airlines in terms of value provided to go on a cruise for a vacation. (Lodging, food, sights for several days for only a few hundred dollars per person in a lot of cases).

\-Still don't believe me that people are not afraid of booking cruises? ""An online poll of more than 4,600 cruise passengers found that about 75% said they plan to either resume taking cruises at the same frequency as before or more often once the coronavirus crisis subsides, according to CruiseCritic.com, a cruise review site."" But, OP, what about the other 25%??? ""The other 25% in the poll said they plan to cruise less often or stay away from cruising indefinitely."" Hmm.

\-One of the concerns is if CCL can survive without short-term revenue, their balance sheet looks the best compared to their competitors and it's actually not too bad. They have the funds to survive this entire year without revenue. ""Carnival's CEO said the company has enough money to make it through the rest of 2020 without bringing in any revenue.""

\-Less than 5 P/E ratio after tanking. Cruises have some pretty good margins (comparing to other industries/businesses). Picture included showcasing the breakdown of costs.

\-It's executives and Saudi Arabia are extremely confident. "" Carnival director Randall Weisenburger bought a large block of shares in the offering"" (1.25 million shares).

\-Cruises will likely implement certain rules and actions for future cruises to ensure that customers to minimize the risk of breakouts such as imposing restrictions on those over 70 or pre-existing conditions. Require coronavirus testing of people before embarking, etc.

\-In a 5-year discounted cash flow EBITDA exit model, assume revenue falling by 50% this year. Sales improve starting in the fiscal year 2023, the CCL stock is worth $19 and also the slightest good news literally pumps this stock up.

For all of you autistic retards who are posting on my last post about PDT and how you dont have day trades... I'm going to settle this for you.

A pattern day trader (PDT) is a regulatory designation for those traders or investors that execute four or more [day trades](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daytrader.asp) during five business days’ time using a margin account.

RH is a margin account, which means it allows you to have your funds immediately before they are settled. Good for you. You closed your position for a loss and you can immediately enter another position to lose even more money. Congrats.... that money is available immediately and you wont have it much longer.

Get a real broker and use a cash account. You can make as many day trades as you would like until you have used your whole account in buying power for the day. Here is how it works.

Since you are all retarded and have roughly 1500 sweet tendies in your account. If you made 15 day trades all for a purchase of 100 dollars and a sell for 50 dollars, you are out of money for the day. Which is probably good because you suck. That money has to be cleared before you can use it again (TOS is cleared next day) so now you have 750 dollars available the next day. Now you can make 7x100 dollar purchases and lose half of those and sell. Your 350 will be available the next day plus your 50. Now you have 400 dollars to rip into USO calls because your retarded. At this point.... we all know you are going to hold them, and BAM you are now broke and didnt have to worry about PDT.

Every time I see one of you failures pissed because you are holding gains over night, and lose it all the next day due to disney jumping 8 dollars off some bullshit news I smile a little bit. With that being said, I'm sick of smiling. It makes my wife think I'm happy. Which means she wants to stick around instead of getting railed out by her boyfriend.

293,Discussion,Theta Plays for the Week,37,g3ggag,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3ggag/theta_plays_for_the_week/,77,1587208165.0,"I created a spreadsheet of my Theta plays over the last 10 days to illustrate a low stress strategy resulting in small gains that add up over time. You need to have cash or cash equivalent to purchase options you write in case in case of assignment, so don't write naked calls or puts if you are not willing and able to purchase the underlying equity. 

On April 7, I sold off most of my long calls and bought 1,000 shares of SPY. I started writing covered calls from April 8-April 15. I mostly bought back on the day of expiration and wrote new covered calls that expire the next available weekly. 

On April 15, SPY dropped, and I entered a stop loss order that is GTC and sells 1,000 shares of SPY if the price drops below $275.50. Since April 15, I have been writing puts at below the stop loss price. Since the strike price is less than the stop loss price, the puts I write will not be triggered unless I first exit my position. This would lower the cost for me to hold 1,000 shares of SPY.

I am not expecting huge gains, however, this strategy is also ""safe"" since I don't mind holding the equities, and I pick strike prices that would only allow me to reduce the cost to hold the same amount of SPY. More importantly, the stress level of making theta plays is magnitudes lower than holding soon to expire OTM calls/puts.

Reversals don't happen because a magical technical level is reached, or the chart looks some inordinate way, but rather flows shift. The reason flows change is pointless in the end, but rather should be observed. **That said, below I'll provide my best guess on what I believe might provide a catalyst for a reversal of this trend.

If one is inclined to make a trend reversal bet, option term structures give one an opportunity to take advantage of elevated premium, even when beta-adjusted, at 7-60 DTE in my view.

**Thoughts on reversal possibilities**: I do not believe recent stimulus is going to ""cure"" the economic contraction. This is to say, the amount of stimulus currently provided will not be enough. I expect an infrastructure plan of some sort, additional fiscal stimulus to small and medium size businesses, and a continued (if not accelerated) protectionism posture. These factors are likely to support smaller companies, publicly traded or otherwise.

I summarize from multiple sources so if you see an error blame CNBC or WSJ. 

  
This is what happened this week.   
 

04/11 - JP Morgan and other lenders are beginning to increase their mortgage borrowing requirements as they foresee a downturn in the housing market. They fear rising unemployment, sudden pay cuts, decreasing home values, in combination with social distancing guidelines will have a very negative impact and are looking to decrease their risk exposure. For the 2nd half of March, requests to delay mortgage payments increased by 1,900%. An alarming figure that even JPow might not have an answer for.

04/11 - It should be a surprise to no one that the numbers are not adding up with a swift economic rebound in China. Despite posting a much improved PMI number, China's pollution data last measured on April 5th, was determined to be at its lowest point since the outbreak began in Wuhan. Chinese coal use and property sale are still well below their pre-virus numbers indicating their factories are not ramping up to full production. Mayor Bill De Blasio stated that New York schools will remain closed until next fall, although Governor Andrew Cumo said he was the only one with the power to make such a declaration. Italy has extended its lock down to May 3rd. India is extending its lock down an additional 2 weeks to the end of April, and Trump has begun to take the stance that the US economy will not reopen until it is best for public health. He is assembling a ""Opening our country"" task force to determine when the US will be able to ease restrictions due to the virus. 

Spain and Austria plan on allowing small non-essential businesses to reopen while the lockdown in Wuhan, China has officially ended. Although outside arrivals to china has raised concerns in Beijing and Hong Kong about spreading a second wave as they logged an additional 34 new cases, all attributed to arrivals from overseas.

04/11 - Mexico over the weekend decided to play hard ball and would only make an oil cut of 100,000 barrels per day. Saudi Arabia was not happy with this and said they would only reduce their supply to 8.2 million bpd if Mexico cut their fair share too. US panicked and got on the phone with Mexico and Trump agreed that the US would cut an additional 250,000 bpd to make up for what Mexico refused to cut. OPEC agreed to cuts of 10 million bpd during May and June, then an 8 mil bpd cut from July to the end of the year, followed by a 6mil bpd cut from January 2021-2022 As of right now, it is estimated that there is a current demand loss of 20-35 million bpd while quarantines stay in affect.

\*\*\*UPDATE - A deal was finalized on Sunday with sources reporting that G20 countries will be cutting an additional 3.3 million barrels, in addition to the 10 million vowed by OPEC. IEA also plans to announce oil purchases on 04/13 adding to their reserve which will reduce the amount of oil on the market \*\*\*

04/12 - SoftBank Vision fund seems to be going through some difficulties to put it mildly. They are forecasting that 15 companies within the fund are expected to go bankrupt, while other companies they are significantly invested in such as uber, have heightened exposure to the Covid 19 pandemic. 

In recent weeks, Softbank withdrew its offer to buy 3 billion dollars worth of WeWork stock due to concerns over their ability to meet various closing conditions. WeWork has now filed a lawsuit against SoftBank for withdrawing their offer. SoftBank So far has invested 14.3 Billion dollars into WeWork, their biggest investment, which by all appearances seems to be largely failing throughout the US.

Uber has been another strain on WeWork, since the ride sharing service has seen a 40-60% decline in rides since the pandemic began. With multiple failed IPO, upcoming bankruptcies, and 40% of their fund being exposed to transportation and logistics, SoftBanks vision fund at the least may be screwed for a while. 

UPDATE. On 04/13 SoftBank announced a 16.7Billion dollar write down on the value of the vision fund. This write down reflects a loss of 9.9 Billion dollars of value in the quarter ending in March, wiping out their cumulative gains of 9.5 Billion through December

04/12 - Democrats and Republicans are getting ready to provide more relief to Americans through the CARES act. The Cares act initially provided 2 trillion dollars worth of relief to individuals and businesses but now Democrat and Republican leaders are saying it's not enough. New additions to the current CARES act could add more than 1 trillion in additional relief. The funding would mostly be targeted to small businesses, unemployment aid, and possibly a 2nd round of stimulus check to each household. Banks which began taking applications for small business loans last week, were quickly stretched to their limit. BofA took in over 177,000 applications requesting a total of 36.2 Billion in financing. While Wells Fargo quickly reached their cap of 10 billion they planned on giving out in small business loans. Confusion remained among small business owners about what exactly the criteria was for receiving this money, and many found themselves ineligible to file with their bank due to current guidelines. As of Wednesday the Small Business Association said it has received over 381,000 applications for small business loans totaling over $100 Billion dollars. President Trump also made statements that no additional funding would be provided for the US post office and that he would not sign off on any bill that attempted to do so. The US post office has requested 75 billion to help them maintain operations. Some fear without some sort of stimulus for the post office, they will not be able to operate through the summer in current economic conditions. 

04/13 - Soon, money might not even matter when we’re unable to actually eat. Globally, food processing plants have seen up to a third of their workers walk off the job, or not show up at all as they fear for their safety due to Covid 19. The closing of global economies has presented unique challenges for various parts of the food industry. While demand has dropped drastically from the restaurant sector, there's been a surge in orders from grocery stores for beef and pork. Add that to the lack of workers, processing plants are struggling to keep up with demand, while various plants all around the globe have shut down temporarily due to outbreaks or significantly reduce demand within their specific sector. Smith Field food, the world largest pork processor has shut down one of their pork processing plants which accounts for 4-5% of the US production. JBUS in Colorado announced they will be shutting down their beef plant temporarily which accounts for 5% of US supply. Additional closures in the industry are anticipated. 

Dairy has also been hit hard, as they see their demand plummet. The issue has become so bad that dairy processing plants are dumping out the milk due to oversupply. Farmers claim the issue is that cows simply can’t stop producing milk on demand. So dairy supply is likely to continue outpacing demand.

Globally crop workers have stopped showing up to work, or are not being allowed to travel to work, which is leading to rotting crops. The fruit that is salvageable has nowhere to go due to a lack of shipping containers, and competitive demand for air cargo space. The lack of workers also causes concerns that we’re missing our short window to plant fruit and vegetables for future harvest. 

To add insult to injury, sudden layoffs and furloughs have created an unprecedented influx of mouths to feed for food banks in the US and Europe. Some food banks have reported running out of food within just hours. A problem that many think will only get worse the longer world economies remain under lockdown. 

 04/13 GE has made a move to replace all their short term debt with long term debt that will push the due date to 2024. The move is said to be debt neutral and will not add onto the total amount of debt that GE owes. Currently GE has $35 billion in bonds due between now and 2024. 

04/13 A chapter 11 bankruptcy is looking more and more likely for AMC movie theaters. On Monday 04/13 they were downgraded from neutral to sell out of fears they are running out of liquidity options and won't be able to rebound or even open after the quarantine. AMC has started taking drastic measures to keep it's doors open though the shut downs. All 600 of AMC corporate employees have been furloughed, and they have told their landlords that they will not be paying rent for the month of April. Their rent is currently 250 million per quarter. 

04/13 Governors of democratic states are taking lockdown easement measures into their own hands. California and Oregon have joined New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts in saying they will rely on health & economic officials to determine when to reopen their economy. This caused backlash from president Trump who tweeted out that it is ultimately the Federal government who holds the power to determine when states could begin to reopen. There has been no official date discussed on when the economy may reopen, but some governors believe that the lockdowns could extend beyond May 1st. Overall it seems to be the stance of the Democrats that everyone must be healthy before we worry about the health of the economy. Republicans have pushed for reopening the economy sooner than later while practicing social distancing fearing the longer we remain quarantined, the less likely a quick economic recovery becomes. 

04/14 - To kick off earnings season Wells Fargo reported revenue of 17.78billion, which was lower than the expected 19.35 Billion. WFC posted an earnings .01cents per share, which is down from an earnings of .93 cents per share from their previous quarter. Their net income also dropped a staggering 89% to $653 million for this quarter. 

JPMorgan reported revenue of 28.3 Billion, which was lower than the estimated 29 Billion. They also posted an earnings per share of .78 cents, well below the 1.84 estimates. 

Both banks reportedly added billions to their reserves in anticipation for a high level of credit defaults from their customers and businesses. 

$GE, $DIS, $XOM and $WBA have all made moves in regards to securing and rolling over their credit, as fear grows that they’ll run out of credit to maintain their operations. XOM issued 9.5 Billion in debt, while DIS extended their credit line by 5billion dollars. 

Companies such as $F, $M, $DAL, and $GPS, have seen their Corporate bonds ratings drop to Junk bond status. Although the Fed has announced that they will be making purchases within the junk bond market. 

Some estimates are predicting that the airline industry could take a 300billion dollar hit this year. 

Vaccine manufacturers are under pressure to create vaccines faster than ever before, due to the belief that the economy can’t truly return back to normal until we have a vaccine. For every day the economy is shut down, it is estimated the US loses 25Billion dollars.

WeWork will not be paying their Manhattan rent for this month, joining a growing list of companies who told their landlords they will not be paying rent**.** WeWork is currently the largest tenant in Manhattan paying $500 million dollars a year in rent**.** The Cheesecake factory, and AMC are other notable names who have also told landlords they will not paying rent. 

This has all been seen as fantastic news to investors, and reason to be bullish. Markets have now regained about 50% of their losses from March after having their best week in decades last week, the NASDAQ is on its longest winning streak since December, and the S&P500 is trading at 35x earnings. $TSLA is back above $700, and most tech stocks are racing towards their ATHs. 

04/16 - The IEA, which is seen as a more neutral player in the oil industry in comparison to OPEC that provides accurate information, found that Oil demand was down by 29M BPD for the month of April. They estimate overall, oil demand will fall by approximately 9.3M BPD for the year of 2020. Under the current OPEC deal, OPEC countries will cut approx 9M bpd starting May until June, then 8M BDP for the rest of the year after that. Globally oil reserves are starting to fill up due to excess demand, and the US is forecasting their oil reserves will be full by summer. Trump is considering paying US Shale companies to cut back on production to prevent this from happening. 

As of 04/16 unemployment claims have increased to 23 million, as 5M more americans filed for unemployment benefits the previous week. Economists predicted that the US would have an unemployment rate of 12% by the end of the month, while some payroll indicators predict that we may already be at 16% unemployment midway through April. 

The Small Business Association has run out of 350Billion in funds approved by congress to loan to small businesses affected by the Corona Virus. The reported figures vary, but somewhere between 1.6 - 1.9M applications have been approved for loans, while over 3M applications have been submitted. The SBA says they can approve no more additional applications until congress secures more funding for the PPP (payroll protection program). Congress is in talks to add an additional 250B in funding for the program. Democrats refuse to support the current bill, and are requesting billions more in funding be added for hospitals and local governments. 

**\*\*UPDATE\*\*** 23% of the SBA loans went to California, New York, and Texas receiving a total of 81billion in loans. Retail, food and accomodation accounted for less than 9% of the approved loans despite being the industries hit hardest by the Corona virus. Construction firms received 13% of all loans,. 

After markets closed on Thursday, Gilead $GILD announced positive results from their clinical drug trials being conducted at The University of Chicago Hospital. Their antiviral drug Remdesivir was identified as one of few that may be effective at combating Covid-19. Out of 125 patients enrolled, 113 were classified as severe covid cases. Out of the 125 only 2 died during the trial, and “a majority of the patients enrolled in the trial have already been discharged from the hospital” although the exact number of patients discharged was not given. It is noteworthy that there was no placebo group included with this study. Also this drug will only work for patients already infected with covid-19 and does not act as a vaccine. 

The white house has released a list of guidelines for states to follow when reopening their counties. Withdrawing from his previous stance, Trump has now said he’ll leave it up to the governors to decide when their state/counties have satisfied the requirements for reopening. The guidelines suggest that “Regions see a decline in documented cases over a 14 day period, ensure hospitals can treat all patients without crisis care, have a robust testing program in place and antibody testing for at risk healthcare workers.” The guidelines are to be followed in 3 different phases with each phase allowing more sectors of the economy to open up while still following social distancing measures. It is still believed by many physicians and economists that the social distancing measures will have to stay in place until an actual vaccine is developed. 

Boeing $BA also announced after the markets closed that they will be resuming production of their commercial airplanes. The announcement by $BA in combination with $GILD clinical trials and reopening guidelines sent futures higher heading into Friday. At the time of writing this the Dow Jones is up 860 points in the futures market.   

04/17 - Apple $AAPL received a downgrade this morning from Goldman Sachs from *neutral* to *sell* over concerns that iPhones sales would slump due to Corvid 19. $AMZN, $NFLX are also down by greater than 2% which seems to be weighing down on the rally everyone had hoped for, although the day is still green overall. $MRNA is up over 15% over hopes of a vaccine and federal funding, $BA is up by 13% due to revamping production of their commercial planes, and $TSLA continues to inch higher towards $800. As of midday, $TSLA is trading at $756.

04/17 - The race to create a vaccine for Covid 19 is still in full effect as Moderna $MRNA is set to receive $483 Million from the federal government to accelerate the development of a vaccine. Phase one for the vaccine is already underway with patients being vaccinated in March. The additional money from the government will go towards supporting Phase 2 & 3 of development. 

In the UK a million doses of a potential vaccine are already being developed, though the vaccine is still being tested in trials and has not been approved. It is estimated that production of the vaccine will be ready by September. The company developing the vaccine is putting itself at great financial risk by starting early production, because if the vaccine proves to be ineffective or is not approved then it can not be distributed to the public population. No official number was given, only that production costs tens of millions of dollars. There are currently over 70 vaccines under development with at least 5 of those already in the human trial phase.",2020-04-18 06:46:14,-0.8228,0.0,0.4707774193548387,-0.11734086021505376

This post is also for me to collect my thoughts. I'm not about to baby you fucks and tell you exactly what to do and when, this is for the general trend of the market to follow along with and hopefully make better trades.



TLDR: If we break above 290 on SPY then we will head much higher, if we break down from 290 area then we may see new lows. This is the battle grounds for SPY and whatever the market gives us, make the trade and let's make money. 



We are at key support on SPY, 286-290 range. Most of the time when you have a sharp pull back you have a 33% - 50% pullback. This is usually based on Fibonacci. We dropped around 117 points and are now around 66 points gained. 



As you can see on the chart 287 is a major area with it acting as resistance and support in multiple areas throughout the years. This will hold true and be an area to watch....DO NOT GET FOOLED though, this area will be highly contested and you WILL see over and under shoots, meaning everyone is watching the same number so people will try to jump over it. 


You can trade this two ways: on the initial trade, going above/ under 287-290 or.... When we come back to test the line. Under normal circumstances we will come back and test 287 area, we may shoot above or under it but we will test the area again. That is when you can get in for a long position because we will likely not coming back to this area again. Meaning, if we go above and test then we will continue going up from there... or down and test 287 then we will be going down much more for a while. This is the make or break point for this market. 



* I know it seems im just saying, it will go up- or down without saying anything, but that is not the case. I'm saying, if we break out of the 290 area then we will be going up for a while, if we break down from the 290 area then we will be headed south hard. 


I want to make a note on these charts, they are not perfectly aligned and do not represent dates or times. This chart represents movement and the types of movements to look for. This chart is set to a hourly close and should be looked at on a hourly chart. Lastly, these will take a while to play out over all, we will have huge swings between it all but the general market should move as I noted on the chart.


I personally think we are headed for new lows but this time will probably be a slower bleed.

DD based on publicly available information only:

Fluor reached all time lows a month ago ($2.85) due to a string of earnings losses, an SEC investigation into financial reporting, and a confluence of oil crunch and coronavirus uncertainty. Sounds like a recipe for near bankruptcy after being 80% down from the 52Wk High ($41.91), but hear me out:

Some fundamentals:

1. FLR cash on hand is $1.85B, or $13/share
2. 1Y Target value of $16.3
3. Price/Book ratio = 0.74
4. Forward P/E = 5.87
5. 5% dividend yield
6. New CEO, new risk profile, and new management
7. $33B project backlog
8. 108 year old company, which has withstood several downturns

Current volatility stands at about 112%, leading to some very attractive option opportunities.

The following events could make this stock jump massively in the short-term:

1. Clearing of SEC investigation with minimal fines

2. Posting a profit on upcoming earnings

3. Passing of infrastructure bill

Then a couple months would go by and things would start to look hairy with the market down a little and he'd state ""we're close to wrapping up phase 1"".  And when things got iffy again and the market dropped a couple more points 6 months later all of sudden BOOM he'd state ""we've wrapped up phase 1 and are now on to phase 2.""

Most of you called me a retard as I would expect and made fun of technical analysis which is to be expected here, but update my points. 

1. **RETRACEMENT:** I expect to see no more than a 60-65% retracement from the lows before we continue our next leg down. That will happen when SPY is around **290-295.** 
2. **VOLUME:** It gets lower and lower every day. It's pretty insane if we compare it to our late February early March levels. [Here's a pretty picture.](https://imgur.com/a/2zFoiUb) Obviously this is very rough but you can see what I'm trying to get at. 
3. [ASCENDING WEDGE:](https://imgur.com/a/8vew4Rz) The ascending wedge which I've said is forming on $SPY is still going strong. 

In summary, I think SPY is going to end its massive bull run soon. It will peak around 290-295 but don't be surprised if it goes as high as 300. This is where you should ask mom and dad for a loan and jack yourself to the fucking titties with SPY puts.

As we all know, despite the stock market mooning the real economy is not doing so well. $Z operates within the residential housing market and has three segments: 

\- Homes: Zillow buys and resell homes. This is a new segment they started in Q4 2018

\- IMT: Primarily advertising revenue from agents and rentals

\- Mortgages: Advertising sold to mortgage lenders/professionals

Ok now that you understand the business lets get down to the fundamentals. Lets start with the pros: 

* **Strong liquidity:** Zillow has a fuck ton of cash and they aren't going bankrupt. Lets juts get that out of the way. As of Feb 29, 2020 the company has $2.5 billion in cash and short term investments (mostly government bonds). Against these liquid assets they have liabilities totaling $2.5 billion comprising of $563 million in loans against their inventory of homes and $2 billion of corporate debt. The corporate debt holds a relatively low interest rate (\~1.75%), is convertible to equity (means they arent forced to pay it back in cash if they don't want to), and only $460 million of this corporate debt is due by 2021 with the rest due much later(no imminent refinancing needs).
* **Strong management team:** Zillow's CEO Rich Barton knows what the fuck he is doing and has experience leading in a crisis that is going to fuck over his industry. He founded Expedia and led it not only through the 08 crisis but also 9/11 when everyone thought travel was dead forever

Ok now on to the cons and why I believe this stock has a long way to fall

* **Terrible Industry Fundamentals:** Housing is extremely cyclical and will fall drastically in a recession scenario. If you all think people will buy less iphones in a recession just imagine how many fewer houses will be bought. Zillow thrives in a market where there are lots of transactions since they make most of their money on advertising sales. No transactions = no advertising. Housing will be a lagging indicator here as it will take more time to see the full effects of the recession within the housing market. On the most recent investor call the CEO actually affirmed their Q1 guidance. He did say that the market did not start seeing any sort of changes in buyer/seller behavior until March 15 and later so they will only have 2 weeks of downside data in their next earnings. The CEO did also mention however that they saw up to a 49% decline in website visits in shelter-in-place markets. Zillow themselves have also said they will put a hold on buying new houses. 
* **High level of unprofitable homes inventory remaining:** As I mentioned earlier Zillow began their new homes segment late 2018. Rather than just acting as a middleman, Zillow is not in the business of taking ownership of and selling homes directly. The past 2 years have been some of the  best years for the housing market with home prices getting extended to relative levels not seen since the 2008 crisis. Zillow has been buying homes during this entire time. As of March 2020, Zillow has 1,859 remaining homes on their balance sheet totaling about $645 million in value. Now lets dig into the profitability of these homes. According to the company's 10K, Zillow sold $1.4 billion worth of homes in 2019. However, the gross margin was only 3.6%. So in the best housing market in over 10 years the company eeked out 3.6% before any sales/marketing, development, or other administrative costs. On an EBITDA (proxy for profitability/cash flow) basis the homes segment generated **negative** $241 million. We would expect negative profitability for a new segment such as this because of the new costs behind the scenes to set up this program but it shows that the segment is already unprofitable. Now what do you guys expect will happen to the selling prices of the remaining 1,859 homes? During what period of the cycle were they purchased? Now you have your answer to the profitability.

Lets talk timing. The company's Q1 earnings report is May 15. Management held a conference call on March 23 where they reaffirmed Q1 guidance but pulled full year guidance. So there will be no surprises here and I don't expect the stock to move much due to earnings. Q2 earnings will be a different story and I expect them to post historically bad earnings at least Q2 and Q3 and likely longer. 

All this being said I still believe in the company long term. Crisis' often accelerate trends and Zillow is the leader in the shift towards a more digitized home buying and selling experience. On top of that they have a great management team and no bankruptcy risk. The good news for us is that Wall Street often does not think in the long term view and shits its pants each quarter due to earnings. I expect a significant retrace in Zillows stock price in the next 3-5 months. If it does get down to the sub $20's again I recommend buying leaps or boring old stocks.

But, the similarity between a snapshot of the August - November 2018 SPY daily chart and the current SPY daily chart is pretty interesting. The main difference is the scale of movement, which I believe is why the SMA 50 and 200 death cross is timed differently; it is a different environment. The recent original selloff was much more aggressive than in 2018. That argument could mean that the similarity between the two charts is nothing more than an interesting correlation.

However, there is some severe damage to the economy from a number of different vantage points, and even if Gilead's drug does work (and it looks like it may actually make a meaningful difference), AFAIK, it's IV-only. Because of that, I could see a similar pattern repeating.

The board structured the purchase specifically to avoid a shareholders vote. This required an outside financier (Warren Buffet) to loan OXY the billions necessary for the purchase. He wrote himself a hell of a deal which the board agreed to - 8% premium dividends, payable by cash or equity.

The bill is coming due for OXY, and they are so strapped for cash with oil crashing that they're paying Buffet back by issuing new shares, diluting the value of existing holders. OXY is also paying a premium for paying his dividend in shares rather than cash [Barrons](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.barrons.com/amp/articles/occidental-petroleum-would-pay-a-bonus-if-dividend-payments-to-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-are-in-stock-51586179749)

Revised: ~~Buffet has signaled he may sell the shares off.~~ poor source. 

OXY still has several billion dollars in bonds outstanding and coming due this summer and near zero cash flow. The equity values are dependent on oil being $50/barrel. The risks on puts are acquisition (unlikely when the other major players are also hurting) or government subsidies, which are unlikely as congress is in recess and the House will be obstinate after Trump bypassed the oversight in the first bailout.

If oil stays below the $20 mark, I see OXY going to $5 by end of May.

Tech stocks were soaring, people were buying stocks to crazy levels despite reality, Buffett retreated to his cave. Not dissimilar to right now. Then it all came crashing down.

What gets lost in the noise is that *advertising rates fucking sank like a rock, almost immediately*. I'm talking $35 CPM rates went to $1 within a month. Why is this relevant? There are many, many signs that advertising is dead right now, across the board. Affiliates are cancelling programs, ad prices and revenue are dead, etc. Ads are the first thing that get cut in situations like this. And why not? No one is buying shit they don't need right now and companies are hoarding their cash. This is a systemic issue because people aren't going to spend as much on random shit, but more importantly *companies aren't going to spend anything trying to get extra market share.* They all shut it down in recessions, every time.

Once they drop, ads stay low for a long time. Ads are a marketplace and ad prices only go up with competition. That takes a long time to rebuild. Even if everything turns rosy, ad revenue is going to be dismal for at least a year and has no chance of getting ""back to normal"" for years.

So who gets fucked? All companies that rely on ad revenue, especially exclusively ad revenue. They see the shit on the wall right away. $YELP, who already fired a bunch of people and furloughed more. $SNAP is fucked. $PINS is fucked. All these companies are going to be a bloodbath when earnings come out (or likely before that when people start to notice). Fuck their cash reserves, that is now their burn rate. Think about where these companies should be priced when suddenly getting only 20% revenue with their expensive offices and expensive employees. They are going to shrivel up as quickly as they can if they want to survive at all.

Yes, this also means $GOOG is going to eat shit. Google announced they are stopping/slowing hiring immediately and just cut summer interns, too. They get almost all their revenue from ads. Immediately that revenue has gone tits up and will stay at a fraction for some time. There is no way they don't get screwed here.

This isn't a stimulus-fixable issue, it is a deep, long-term reaming for years to come. This is WITHOUT considering joblessness, lockdowns, COVID outbreaks, supply chain issues, etc. **These companies literally can't make half their income for quite a while.** Understand that and everything is straightforward.

The only question is, where to stick your puts? I think once earnings hit in May the writing will be on the wall for all of these companies, probably before. But June/July is a bit safer so you don't have to cry when your puts go down 50% in a day from some continued frothy bullshit. If you are smart, accumulate puts carefully until the market starts to turn then buy even more when the selloff starts.

The market is not recognizing how quickly the bottom comes for ad-sensitive businesses in a sharp market turn.

I have reason to believe that shorting these bonds over the course of the year may lead to some gains.

For those who do not know what a high yield bond is, it is a bond from issuers that are at a higher risk to not pay back interest or their returning principal at the time of expiry, so they give higher yields than other bonds because of the risk associated. Here is more info from the SEC's website ""High-yield bond issuers may be companies characterized
as highly leveraged or those experiencing financial
difficulties.  smaller or emerging companies may also
have to issue high-yield bonds to offset unproven operating
histories or because their financial plans may be considered
speculative or risky.""

Due to china flu, the issuers of these bonds are more than likely going to default in the coming months. That $1200 stimulus might pay the bills for a month, but when the economy has literally been in a standstill for months and so many people are filing for unemployment that the systems that process this information are crashing every day, the smaller guys issuing these bonds are going to default because consumers will be spending their money on the essential goods. The Fed can't keep putting a band-aid on these junk bonds forever because there are other parts of the economy that are equally, if not more fucked once these guys start declaring bankruptcy.

For the naysayers that say remdesivir won't matter for GILD's bottom line: **it doesn't fucking matter**. Look at the market right now. Nothing makes sense. Why is ZM 40bil? What about SPCE? Look -- potential future profit doesn't not matter right now, just hype and time in the limelight.

For the naysayers that say the results won't be good based on anecdotal evidence: **it doesn't fucking matter**. I'm in the pharma industry, and let me spell it out for you guys right now in capitalized bold italics:

***THE ONLY THING MATTERS: WILL THE DATA BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT REGISTRATION/FDA APPROVAL***

And it's a fucking yes because you guys that know nothing about the FDA approval process are missing 1 key factor: unmet need. There has never been more massive unmet need. People may be recovering and the spread may be tapering off, but countries will be stockpiling this for years and possibly over a decade. I'll also say this may be the only time in history the FDA doesn't even care about safety anymore. Any hint of slight efficacy and it's a straight approval. They absolutely need a FDA-approved drug for therapy with RCT results backing it up. We just saw GILD pop to near 90 based off a leaked video of study investigators shooting the shit for fucks sake. GILD WILL hit 90-100 off the results and FDA approval, and so I'm buying back in once this train on GILD dies down.

**Background on PRPL**

[Purple Innovation (PRPL)](https://www.purple.com) is a vertically integrated manufacturer, wholesaler and DTC brand of mattresses and other comfort products.   They rocketed their growth through [clever social advertising](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7Afve778_kuhkGXm0RsCg) that has seen hundreds of millions of view over the years.  Just before going public through an SPAC in February 2018 (a very bad move for them to use an SPAC... part of the reason why coverage of their stock has been poor), they started exploring wholesale relationships, primarily with Mattress Firm (MFRM).  They have since aggressively expanded their wholesale relationships to 1,700 doors with various partners (see below), which has driven significant EBITDA improvement (wholesale is more bottom line profitable due to no DTC acquisition costs, although it does drive lower revenue per unit), to the point where PRPL has been ***manufacturing capacity constrained*** since some time last year.  According to [news appearances by the CEO](https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple) and [the Q4 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/13/purple-innovation-inc-prpl-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx), ***Purple sells every mattress they make AND expect to be able to continue to do so***.   CEO Joe Megibow:  "" So I mean so far, as best as we've been able to prove out, there is still significantly more demand out there than our capacity to produce"".

\*Includes a $13.4M non-cash loss associated with the change in fair value of warrant liabilities.  Discussed below.

Purple's growth into cash generation has been phenomenal over the last two years, largely fueled by the very profitable wholesale relationships.   Their revenue growth significantly outpaces their full competitive set, as seen below.   Their Net Income outpaces Casper (CSPR), their closest comparable and the ""other"" new publicly traded bed-in-a-box brand.  PRPL stock experienced a repricing when Casper (CSPR) announced their IPO earlier this year.

&#x200B;

**Comparable to CSPR**

Market Cap (as of 4/16/2020)

PRPL:  $468.3M

CSPR:  $300.3M

Despite signficantly better financial performance and upside, PRPL is currently priced only 55.9% better than CSPR, whose cash reserves were measured in months before COVID-19.

&#x200B;

|*Revenue ($ MM)*|Pre-COVID Guidance|*2019*|*2018*|*2017*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSPR|$108-$112 (Q1)|$439.3|$357.9|$250.9|
|PRPL|$550-$575|$428.4|$285.8|$196.9|

CSPR is slightly larger as of the end of 2019, but PRPL has significantly greater revenue acceleration.

&#x200B;

|Net Income *($ MM)*|Pre-COVID Guidance (Adj EBITDA)|*2019*|*2018*|*2017*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CSPR|$(30)-$(27) (Q1)|$(93.0)|$(92.1)|$(73.4)|
|PRPL|$44-$49 (FY)|$(12.4)\*|$(19.6)|$(8.8)|

CSPR is burning cash like the dumpster fire that it is.   Excepting for a non-cash expense that, in my opinion, should be actually viewed as equity, PRPL would have been net income breakeven for the year and EBITDA positive for the last four quarters.

**Warrant Liability Increase Driving Down the Bottom Line**

I don't want to get into a FASB debate with you, but treating value increases of [warrants](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000121390019007779/fs32019a1_230522purple.htm)  issued with their debt refinancing as an effective expense instead of the equity that it is, is just garbage accounting policy.  Every competent investor should treat those warrants in their calculations of equity (along with the PRPLW warrants), EBITDA per share, and earnings per share.  Regardless, due to COVID, those warrants are materially down in market value, so we may see a favorable adjustment to earnings for Q1.

&#x200B;

**Guidance for 2020**

On the [Q4 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/13/purple-innovation-inc-prpl-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx), CEO Joe Megibow admitted that guidance was very conservative for the year (aka sandbagged) when he admitted: ""We have the capacity we need to meet our sales goals for the year.""  Per Joe, with an additional 40% increase in manufacturing capacity (from 2019 capacity) ""coming online later in the year..., that's upside potential, and ***we will sell every mattress we make as we always have***. That's ***upside potential late in the year***, but that's also building up the capacity we need into the expected growth into 2021.""   The team was planning for 20% upside to their guidance (40% capacity for the last half of the year by my estimate).

This 40% in planned capacity increase (from 2019 capacity) is in additional to the 40% increase in capacity that comes from Mattress Max machines 6 & 7 that have already been executed against.   From the call:  "" Again, 6 and 7 will be up imminently. We said 6 would be up by the end of Q1 and 7, early Q2. We're clearly on that path right now.""   Lastly, [Joe previously announced](https://www.nasdaq.com/videos/silicon-slopes%3A-joe-megibow-ceo-purple) operational efficiency improvements to bring capacity up a total of 100% by the end of 2020 (40% capacity due to machines 6 & 7, which are complete, 40% due to machines 8 & 9, and 20% due to efficiencies).

The planned 2020 capex of approximately $40M is largely attributable to PP&E used to create the additional 28.6% in capacity (mattress max machines 8 & 9).

&#x200B;

**COVID Updates and Cash Preservation**

During the Q4 earnings call, Joe summarized their supply chain risk due to COVID as: "" as of right now, we don't see any critical bottlenecks of any kind.""   This is because they do their own manufacturing in the US.

On 3/26, similar to many other companies, [PRPL withdrew its guidance for the year](https://investors.purple.com/file/Index?KeyFile=403411085).  PRPL stated at this time that more than half of its wholesale doors had closed, but that its online business had increased year over year.   Keep in mind, PRPL had been pulling back substantially on its online business in the second half of 2019 to service its wholesale business, so this is a marked acceleration in digital.

On Monday 4/13, [PRPL gave additional guidance](https://investors.purple.com/file/Index?KeyFile=403589988) on their COVID activities.   Wholesale continued to decline due to wholesale location temporary closures, but digital revenue was pacing at a 35% YoY increase over Q1 2018 ([Digital Revenue was 64% of Q1 2018 Revenue or $53.5M](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-prpl-earnings-conference-051110542.html)), which means the team is on track for $72.2M in digital revenue for Q1.   In addition to this Q1 digital revenue, as of the [March 9 Q4 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/13/purple-innovation-inc-prpl-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx), PRPL had ""not yet seen any impact and are hopeful any future impact will be minimal"" from COVID in regards to sales revenues.   This means that the team saw the full wholesale revenue for 2/3s of Q1 and half of wholesale revenue for the last 1/3.  So far, **the net loss to revenue has not been catastrophic in the least**.  Q1 should be solid.

To hedge, PRPL has gone into cash preservation mode using ""this increase in digital demand we've experienced \[to allow\] us to work through a significant portion of our on-hand inventory"".   35% of their workforce was furloughed (so we assume a temporary 35% drop in manufacturing capacity).  Interest was deferred, compensation of executives reduced, and capital projects delayed, which all mean that PRPL is well prepared to weather the storm with its $26M cash on hand as of 3/31.

# HERE IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY FUN

**Wholesale sales resiliency**

Assuming the US begins to open up, over the next few weeks, ***PRPL will be able to recover ALL of its sales for the year up to its manufacturing capacity***.   Here is why:  it only occupies 30.9% of its disclosed wholesale doors as of 12/31 (1,800 doors per Q4 earnings call out of a potential 5,825 doors of known partners).  Per the Q4 earnings call, PRPL simply needs to add 900 doors (which partners are eager to do) to meet its full year plan, or an increase from 30.9% of doors to 46.4% of doors.

List of Partners from the Q4 earnings call:

* Mattress Firm (3,420 locations total--great relationship here and expansion has been limited by manufacturing capacity--PRPL is only in 800 per Q3 call)
* Macy's (770 locations total -> reducing by 125)
* Bloomingdales (38 locations total)
* Furniture Row (330 locations total)
* Home (188 locations total)
* Bed Bath & Beyond (1,024 locations total)
* Steinhafels (18 locations total)
* Mathis Brothers (20 locations total)
* Raymour & Flanigan (142 locations total)

***PRPL has many more potential partners***.  Additionally, per the earnings call when asked about further partner expansion, Joe responded:  "" We believe there's still significant opportunity for expansion and are nowhere near a point that we're cannibalizing from any one channel to each other or from any one retailer to another.""

He later added: "" Right now, for the prior comments, we are still feeling more demand than we've been able to meet. We have many more partners. I mean, honestly, we're at a point right now that when we speak with other retail channel partners, it's not where it started years ago, which is, ""Hey, we'll throw it in 10 stores and see how it goes."" If they want to work with us, they typically want to go fleet wide. So it's really just making sure we've got the capacity to support a major regional player as we look at that. Again, right now, we have some existing retailers like Mattress Firm, that there's still plenty of opportunity for expansion. And we're making sure that we are leveraging our existing players first.""

***To fully sell out its manufacturing capacity for the year, PRPL simply needs to expand the number of wholesale doors it is servicing***, which, per the Q4 earnings call, it can easily do.  Because PRPL can fully meet sales plan at 46.4% of doors, ***those doors can have more than a 50% reduction in consumer demand*** (especially considering that Q1 was already baked) ***and PRPL will still make numbers***.  This doesn't even include the benefit of the digital acceleration seen due to COVID.

&#x200B;

**Macro Trends in Mattresses**

The US mattress market on one report was $17.3B forecasted to grow to $18.9B by 2023.   Per PRPL Q4 Earnings Call, Purple estimates that they only have 2.5% market share.  There are somewhere around [200 other bed-in-a-box mattress companies](https://www.consumerreports.org/mattresses/is-a-bed-in-a-box-right-for-you/) crowding the digital space.   Purple's ability to stand out due to its unique product offering in a crowded space is well proven at this point.   Its opportunity to expand in digital will only accelerate as its competitors begin to drop like flies.

Pre-COVID, private equity markets took a marked turn late last year and early this year with the WeWork, Casper, and Outdoor Voices fiascos.   Investors are no longer willing to pay for growth at all costs.   This has forced cash-burning DTC brands to get desperate in acquiring more funding, including down rounds and poorly timed IPOs (looking at you Casper).

With COVID, we should expect to see many of these upstart digital competitors to fall out, which will improve digital advertising efficiencies for PRPL in the intermediate term.

&#x200B;

**Near Term Trend**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z00pr80kddt41.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=76e1fc7bbc86266cee0a4179341baf58b3f0df3b

I expect PRPL to return to the $12-$14 range before earnings on 5/12, and then to hit $20-24 by the end of Q1 2021.

This means PRPLW warrants should be in the range of $1.80-$2.20.

&#x200B;

I am long 530,038 PRPLW warrants and very bullish for PRPL as a solid COVID recovery stock.

389,DD,Taking stock of tanker stocks,81,g2zhb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2zhb0/taking_stock_of_tanker_stocks/,87,1587148350.0,"Ladies and Autists, thank you so much for reading this post this morning. Now I’ve travelled across half of my basement to be here and see about this post. Now I daresay some of you have heard some of the more extravagant rumors about what my plans are, so I just thought you’d like to hear it from me. This is the account - it’s no mystery.

I’m an oil man, ladies and autists. I have numerous tanker stocks across my brokerage accounts. I have many tankers storing many thousands of barrels per day. I like to think of myself as an oil man. And as an oil man I hope that you’ll forgive just good oil-fashioned plain speaking:

Two weeks ago on April 5 I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fux17s/buy_tanker_stocks_if_you_like_tendies/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) some DD encouraging you all to invest in tanker stocks. Now those tanker stocks have [appreciated meaningfully](https://postimg.cc/BPq8gfPn), some by as much as 20%, which may tempt some of you to profit and return to your old ways of speculating on SPY puts. 

But what I’m trying here to do is invest. Yes I said it: *invest*. I know this is an unfamiliar concept to you all, but I promise that as a seasoned speculator and investor alike, both can generate substantial tendies. And these tanker stocks are an *investment*.

It’s well known at this time that there’s a shortage of oil storage. It’s well reflected in the substantial contango exhibited in the futures market. It’s well reflected in elevated day rates for VLCCs. And it’s well reflected in DOE numbers showing record builds in crude inventory. But are tanker stocks fully pricing it in?

I daresay they are not. The majority of these stocks are trading at mere 10-20% premium to their net asset value while day rates continue to soar. Where before these tankers earned a mere $20k/day transporting oil, many are earning well above $200k/day. I expect these tankers to achieve day rates in excess of $100k/day for most of the 2Q and into the 3Q. 

Now I’m no mathematician, but if the average VLCC ranges in value from $15m to $90m brand new, let’s say for an average of $50m, and these VLCCs are earning perhaps $100k/day for 90 days, that’s $9m in revenue. In one quarter. 

Yet the average *sell side analyst* - if you still pay attention to any of them... is reluctant to raise their (edit) day rate estimates for VLCC companies beyond $40k-$50k / day for the 2Q and beyond. How come? Because they’re pussies. And having earnings estimates that imply 100%+ upside would seem *unreasonable* and attract too much attention from management, even if they know it’s quite plausible.

So I reiterate. I’m an oil man. I own many tankers storing many barrels of oil. And I’ll continue to do so until the excess earnings is paid to me in the form of substantial price appreciation, perhaps through buybacks, or through  special dividends. DHT, FRO, TNP, and STNG remain among my favorites with EURN and TNP now my top picks. See you all again in two weeks.",2020-04-17 14:32:30,0.9996,0.0,0.2670855072463768,0.4222285024154589

Specifically real estate holdings.  Many of the multi-generation companies that have grown past ""growth companies"" has a ton of corporate real estate assets on their books.  Perhaps they are okay with that , but as the smaller and medium sized businesses begin to leave and new businesses become cautious to enter into a 10 year lease agreement - it will likely mean that the surviving companies will have real estate in a failing corporate real estate market. 

An example is Apple Park.  On their books it is a 5 Billion dollar facility. But it's own technology prevents it from being a 30 Rockefeller Plaza type of asset, where the real estate continued to grow in value over the years because people needed offices, shops, etc around high foot traffic. 

I'm not saying that Apple will have to sell Apple Park, but imagine if it did. Who buys Apple Park for 5 Billion dollars?  There's no market for gigantic headquarters.  Theoretically you could try to find other businesses to move in.  But the truth is that newer start ups are going to want to keep a mortgage+construction off their books and figure out ways to keep people working at home.   


At the worst case scenario Apple could probably find a way to turn Apple Park into housing in SF. And their loss won't be so horrid.    


But if you look at other companies that have relatively useless and inefficient real estate on their books their values are likely carrying a ton of water weight.  And in some scenarios if they do have to sell property to advance their company it'll come at liquidation pricing on top of a financial sheet lowering of evaluation.    


Companies that own construction vehicles that create new corporate real estate.  Or have older semi trucks that will need to be replaced by new electric self driving ones ( or will be replaced by uber-fic-ation ) will all have assets that aren't worth as much as they put in the books.   


 This will be a huge reason why I'm bearish moving forward. Yes, companies will reduce payroll / pensions / etc. And I'm not too concerned about traditional long term investment stocks losing b2b or b2c business in catastrophic ways. But the bulk of the money on wall street is going to take their money away until these assets are priced in and it could be awhile before these companies bleed enough for that consensus to take place.",2020-04-17 13:29:41,-0.9997,0.1779,0.13439999999999996,-0.22913333333333338

#Abstract
Gild is up 16%+ After hours based on a rumor of a study in Chicago in regards to remdesivir as a treatment for COVID, but the only real study on the drug so far is in the New England Journal of Medicine study here:

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007016

The NEJM study is garbage, and it 100% cannot be justified as a cure for COVID. This new study does not sound much better. Even if the results are more promising, they only have 113 subjects in the study (the last study had basically less than 50, more on that in a minute). This stock has fluctuated a LOT based on hearsay, and I see some FD potential as people realize the miracle cure is not here. Not only that, but the current news leak likely is based on fradulent hype that some people are going to Cash in on when the market opens.

#The NEJM Study

First the nerdy stuff. This study has many flaws, but here's a few:

1. Population. They selected patients who had an O2 sat of <=94% on room air, or who were on O2 support (including Nasal Cannula). 30 of these people were ventilated (associated with very high mortality rates), 4 were on ECMO (associated with extremely high mortality rates, and the rest were on noninvasive ventilation assistance (Nasal cannula to BiPAP)

2. Number of subjects. An N of 61 is far too low to draw real conclusions, and apparently 8 of those people ""could not be analyzed. So really an N of 53. THEN 4 patients discontinued the treatment prematurely, so REALLY and N of 49.

**Results**:
57% of the ventilated patients were extubated
13% of the patients died (Mortality rate was 18% on vents and 5% off vents)
100% of those who were on low-flow O2 or ambient air were discharged.
28% of patient's on NIV died or were intubated

**Problems**

1. I can't see how they chose their population, so it is unclear if these people were randomly chosen. It is suspicious that so many of them are Intubated despite their selection including people who would otherwise be on low oxygen, although they did list this as ""compassionate use,"" so high-risk patients were likely chosen, and not randomly.

2. The population is EXTREMELY small for a conclusive drug trial. I know that it isn't a large double-blind FDA trial, but that is my point.

3. As a result of the above, their statistics are hardly worth considering, but they report a mortality of 13% and then try to compare their numbers to studies who report mortality rates of 17-78% in ""similar populations."" This is mostly on data from China, specifically Wuhan. They then *explicitly say* that their data is not comparable:

>However, the patient's enrolled in this compationate-treatment program are not directly comparable to those studied in these other reports [from China].

4. This data is based on 18 days worth of treatment. It does not indicate that everyone who survived for 18 days. Their follow up is anticipated to expand to 28 days, but over HALF of their patients were still hospitalized after the study was published.

Now, anecdotally I have heard COVID mortality rates of about 20% for mechanically ventilated patients in the US. I did a quick search and had a hard time finding data related to the mortality rates for people with similar characteristics to those in this study. Of note, the people in this study did not appear particularly unhealthy. Only 17% had diabetes, 11% had asthma, 25% had hypertension. Off the top of my head, this doesn't seem like a representative population of those who would be high risk for complications, and doesn't seem to account for things like COPD for some reason.

#The New Chicago Study

https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/16/early-peek-at-data-on-gilead-coronavirus-drug-suggests-patients-are-responding-to-treatment/

There are only rumors surrounding the new study, but some facts that we know are that it is 113 subjects, and supposedly only 2 people died in the study. Now, SUPPOSEDLY this study is based on treating *severe* cases of COVID, but there are a couple of problems with that.

Remember how the previous study included people who weren't even on O2, but also for some reason was HEAVILY weighted towards people who were intubated or on Non-invasive ventilation? This makes me HIGHLY skeptical as to what they consider ""severe."" If they are lumping in people who are on things like ECMO with people who aren't even on O2, how can you even compare these two populations in terms of mortality? The last study had 7 people die out of less than 50 real subjects. This one supposedly has only 2, but how do we know that more people were included that were on, say High-flow nasal cannula (not mechanically ventilated)?

Additionally, they say ""over half of our participants were discharged."" Well, just under half of their patients were discharged in the last study. This also doesn't say anything about improving morbidity or mortality. The previous study still had over half of their patients in the hospital at 18 days. Unless they changed their treatments some how, I'm willing to bet that the population was different (they already seemed to have an an unusually healthy ""severe"" population in their previous study, as I mentioned).

But the real kicker is that this study does not and cannot say shit that will sustain this stock trading at ATH. Premarket is already over 4% over their ATH. A 113 person study is not going to say shit, and if the study was so magical that it was game changing, it would have likely been shut down and advanced to much bigger trials because of the massive benefit they saw.

#The Drug

If this drug were approved *tomorrow* for COVID treatment by the FDA, it would be At or over a YEAR before it would be massively produced. The same is true of a Vaccine (though a vaccine could probably come out faster and cheaper). If you are betting on this drug to be a success, it doesn't have to just be a success...


...it has to be success and PRAY that other drugs that are available aren't effective in treating COVID **and** a Vaccine doesn't come out before the drug is rolled out. EITHER of those scenarios would all but tank this drug and the stock with it.


#The Stock

This stock has been extremely volatile since February, but before that was consistently trading below 70. Now it is at or above **90** premarket, basically putting all its new-found value in this one drug that has really not proven much. 

This stock basically booms and busts on a weekly basis. But, I know what you're thinking: ""If the stock moons because of rumors, it's going to hit the ceiling once the study comes out."" Here's some TA for you, look closely:

https://imgur.com/a/7UuNRuV

Don't see it? Look closelier:

https://imgur.com/a/0wNpop5

This stock has been booming and busting ever since the WHO pushed the drug, and it has always cycled in less than 1 week, until recently when it settled at about 75. With this new boom, I predict it will crash **during the day,** and it likely will crash further before 04/23. If you want to be safe, cash in before then because the study data may come out around that time.

Starting next week, expect all the negative articles to pour out about the drug highlighting what I already have said here, and all that enthusiasm will deflate this stock by end of next week. I would say short this bitch a week out by 9-10% every time it booms. Literally cannot go tits up.

#But wait there's more (Juicy drama)

Some people have already posted this, but there were a SHIT TON of calls purchased just before the news dropped after hours, and many are pointing to the author of the original news:

https://twitter.com/RealTianZeng/status/1250979087079878656

Apparently Adam Feurnstein has a history, I don't know. But some HIGHLY suspicious trades were put in for calls that expire tomorrow. Tons of FDs. There's ZERO reason for that volume unless there's some shady shit going on.

This is showing all the signs of a pump-and-dump that you can cash in on with puts

#Conclusion

So, even if the data for the new study shows that the new drug reduced mortality in severe patients by 66%, it STILL isn't saying shit with an N of 113. The last time this stock got pumped by rumors, it cratered in less than 7 days and didn't even budge when the actual NEJM study cam out. Meanwhile, it looks like some people in the background planted the hype and got calls anticipating the pump. This thing is going down, so it  Literally can't go tits up

But just because you are smart doesn't make you money. Let me explain...

According to Gallup (link here) about 55% of Americans own stocks/ETF's, which is around half the population (170 Million People).

 [https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx) 

OK, so what? So...

I have been digging around google a bit, and I didn't find an exact figure but according to various articles and estimates there are about 5 - 10 Million active day/swing traders in the U.S. each day. Lets just call it 10 million.

So here's us, all 10 Million of us and we have a plan. Any LOGICAL person would agree when looking at this market that it HAS to do X - Y or Z, right? I mean we look at the market all day we know what we're doing. WRONG! Those other 160 million people that listen to the media, politicians and what their brokers say will FUCKING CRUSH YOU and there is a good reason. Volume.

Yea, there are some ""lucky"" people on WSB, that's a fact. But 95% of us lose. But you don't have to...

**Stop trying to be so damn smart**. Listen, these people are sheep, OK? They are sheep. They run in any direction they are told to and they run together, just like the Bulls. Bears are solitary creatures for good reason. Nothing is LOGICAL about this and it never will be. I have tried to convince myself time and time again that ""this can't be real"", ""that's impossible"". Well wake up Lucy, it's fucking real. 

This whole system is BIAS and the MM's that run it would rather WATCH PEOPLE DIE than let this market fall. Yea it falls a little bit here and there, and looking at past charts and graphs you would think that A - B - C would happen but its fucking 2020. The markets have learned from past mistakes, politicians and MM's are more cunning, there are algorithms and new laws. 

The shit is rigged and it's more rigged now than it has ever been, as obvious as that may seem. 

I want everyone to make tendies, but most of us won't. Because to be honest this post probably wont be taken seriously and I understand. It's not fun to be a sheep. There's no thrill. Like why even do it if you're not taking a risk. I get it. I lost 10K this month. That might not be as much as some people but it still hurts. I'ts a ten thousand dollar lesson I had to learn. But **YOU** don't have to.

I still don't think we hit bottom, but I know a lot of us Bears are discouraged. All I can say is the next time it dips, if it does, seize the opportunity, don't get greedy and **FOLLOW THE SHEEP**.

If you wanna be a Bear, I get it. If you are a Bull, I can see why. There is no right or wrong. Don't get caught up in what SHOULD happen, or why ""this shit is fucked up"". **You don't have to make sense, you just have to make money.** You guys got this. I believe in all of us.

First, **war in the middle east**.  Do you think the Iranians forgot about Soleimani?  They were not going to give Trump a reason to own them in January.  Things have changed.  They were binding their time to attack when America was weak or distracted.  They have already proven they can destroy Saudi oil installations, and Saudi just gave a big F U to to Republicans in Congress responsible for their defense by flooding the market with oil. 

[This Nouriel Roubini interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI5NRhoPstk)  At 40:20 Roubini explains how regime survival incentives an escalation.

Second, **a severe contraction of the money supply**.  Yea the fed is creating money by making loans to both the private and public sector.  Making loans increases the money supply which which has the effect of brrrrrrrrrrrrr.  The issue is a wave of defaults has the opposite effect, it leads to a massive contraction of the money supply which = deflation.  When an entity defaults on a loan that money just disappears, never to be seen again.  The future beyond three months is very murky, no one knows how many insolvent companies are out there in a post-Covid world.  If they just gave newly created money to people directly this could be avoided, but chances of that are unlikely beyond the survival checks just sent out.  A severe contraction in the money supply would increase defaults by making debt payments more expensive per economics 101.  Oh and the credit markets would freeze up.  This is the specter hunting Powell and why he looks nervous when he speaks in public.

413,DD,Why I'm Not Fucking Selling - The Bear Case (Some Confirmation Bias to Help Bears Sleep At Night),132,g2upsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2upsz/why_im_not_fucking_selling_the_bear_case_some/,84,1587125453.0,"To start this off I want to say I'm just some kid who thinks he's the next Michael Burry but I am actually just retarded without the genius part. My Puts are down quite a substantial amount  since purchasing but these are all the reasons I could come up with for the Bear case and why I am buying more Puts

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Buy longer dated Puts retards**

&#x200B;

**Election Year -**

It's getting increasingly more likely Biden wins due to Trump's depreciating approval rating and if he does win the market will inevitably tank. On the flipside if Trump happens to win the Democrafts will lose their fucking shit and maybe we see something pop off that tanks the market anyways who knows.

**Massive Debt Bubble -**

This one is rather obvious but a government debt to GDP ratio of 110% isn't supposed to be healthy. Obviously there will be long term consequences from this obsessive debt how long that takes to become relevant who knows, but it is important to be aware of it.

Corporate debt also stands at record levels compared to GDP at around: \~75%

Consumer Debt is higher than it was in the 2008 bubble

2008 household debt 14.7 trillion

2020 household debt 15.8 trillion

**Overly Optimistic Lockdown Openings -**

Lockdown dates haven't officially changed at all yet, in fact LA was extended to May 15th. Lockdowns are going to vary WIDELY between states and even counties. So even if we are able to open parts of our country up we wouldn't be running at full capacity anyways so why is the market pricing like we will be back to normal.

This also doesn't consider the fact that there is a very real possibility of having another outbreak by loosening restrictions too early.

**Lifestyle Changes -**

The fact is people will start to live a very different life then they did pre-Covid. Schools are already closed for the rest of the school year and if we don't figure out a way to stop schools from being Covid hotspots then they will stay closed or go online. This would mean parents either have to stay home or pay a stranger (who they probably can't afford anyways) to take care of their kid in the middle of a health pandemic.

People aren't going to be wanting to go traveling, concerts, sporting events, large gatherings anymore, not for the rest of 2020 at least. Unless we get a vaccine or miracle drug, which experts say is minimum 10 months out, then people simply aren't going to be living the same lives anymore.

**Uncertainty -**

The US economy relies on consumers buying shit they don't need. No matter how optimistic Trump is no one is going to be 100% convinced Donald Trump did the impossible and cancelled the looming Global Depression so we can go out and spend money like normal. They will start to save because of uncertainty. Uncertainty/Fear is the only reason people sell and become frugal. There are so many things to be uncertain of right now and no one who means anything in the market is going to ignore that. There's still many unknowns about the virus, the ramifications of unlimited QE, the effects of buying junk bonds, future relations with China and other nations, if policymakers and government will actually come together and work effectively, no one fucking knows this is all our first runs. Relations with China are going to be shaky at best in the coming months to years, possibly saying goodbye to the cheap labor market.

**Unemployment -**

The big one people believe we are flattening the unemployment curve yay! What these autists don't realize its not flattening we are seeing the maximum amount of cases that can be processed daily. We had a holiday last friday

6.62M unemployment cases that came out last week divide that by 5 working days = 1.32M a day

5.25M unemployment cases that came out this week divide that by 4 working days = 1.31M a day wouldn’t that be quite a fucking coincidence huh?

Unemployment is projected to be worse than the Great Fucking Depression also businesses that are currently learning how to operate with less employees will realize they don’t need as many employees to run the business as they thought and they won't suddenly want to add on extra expenses in these uncertain times if they dont have to.

Uncertainty leaves people frugal. Even tech industries that are thriving in this environment like Google are cutting back on hiring because they are""uncertain"" of the future. So we are supposed to believe the companies that are closed right now will reopen ready to hire their whole workforce back?

**Disconnection of Fundamental Investing -**

Companies are no longer being traded at reasonable P/E levels, pretty much every single company is leveraged to the fucking tits

Stocks go up and down but they’ve only been going up for the past 10 years

There hasn't been any fundamental relation to the market valuations anymore they have been pumped by QE, excessive share buybacks, and absurd investor growth expectations and speculations

GDP decelerated from 3.6% in 2018 to 2.9% in 2019 yet in 2019 the SP500 saw 30.43% growth.

Warren Buffet has been sitting on a mountain of cash because he is waiting for prices he doesn't think these are bargain prices yet and I have to agree.

**The Printer Go BRRRRRRRRR -**

We make memes about the printer going brrrrrr but realistically the Fed’s only job is to maintain financial stability and they are aware of hyperinflation. I am not saying they aren’t going to print a shit ton of money but they too know that there is a limit because if they overdue it then they also fuck themselves over by collasping the US dollar.

Even if Powell somehow prints us out of a recession and we escape unscaved, the rest of the world is still fucked and not gonna have a miraculous recovery like us. I bet you autists didn't even know 40% of the SP500 revenue is international so even if we fully recovered there is no reason for us to suddenly start trading at prices like there was no coronavirus.

**Stimulus Money Is Running Out -**

Money for the SBA loan program has already run out and how many of us actually know people that got the money and will be able to use it to successfully turn around their business. The demand is insatiable because it's literally free money, they didn't budge enough for the plan and they let it be first come first serve. Congress isn't exactly happy with Trump at the moment and they are hesitant to allow another bill pass as rushed as the last one was.

**Possible Mortgage Crisis -**

Nearly ⅓ of U.S. apartment renters didn’t pay april rent

Forbearance requests grew by 1,270% between the week of March 2 and the week of March 16, and another 1,896% between the week of March 16 and March 30th.

You expect me to believe that once all the forbearance payments are due in one lump sum the homeowners will have enough money to pay it?

Only 40% of Americans are able to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense such as an Emergency room visit.

**Debt Cycle -**

There are two debt cycles a short term debt cycle which happens ever 10 years or so and the long term debt cycle which takes about 100 years to go through.

According to the theory we should be due for another depression like downswing which would match up with the timeline of the great depression roughly 9 years ago.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=19s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=19s)

Ray Dalio explains it very well.

**Fucking Logic -**

At this point SPY is at $287 which is actually closer to our ATH of 339.08 than our “bottom” at $222.95

Unless you believe we are going to new ATH soon then there’s much more room for downside than upside in the short term, switching to calls would seem in layman's terms retarded

**Conclusion -**

Stocks go up and they go down. But I believe we will see another bottom. The problem is when? To be honest I have no fucking clue. The best I can do is pick something far but reasonable. I have Puts dated all the way to October

Hold the fucking line you pussies you can still hear the greedy ass bulls slapping you in the face with their cocks

1. Results from SARS 2003 trials were grim.

“These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.”

***DEADLY FAILURE***

[SARS 2003 Vaccine Candidate Results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335060/)

2. We have never successfully vaccinated against a corona virus. COVID-2019 is a highly transmittable diseases while its little brother SARS 2003 was easy to contain.
 
“With SARS, most human-to-human infections occurred in health care settings that lacked robust infection control procedures. When infection control practices were implemented, the outbreak ended. Since then, the only occurrences have occurred through laboratory accidents. They have not spread throughout the community.

COVID-19 appears to spread person-to-person, through droplets that are expelled when a person coughs or sneezes and then are inhaled by a nearby person. Less often, it may be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching one’s mouth, nose, or eyes. Transmission may also occur before a person becomes symptomatic”

[SARS 2003 v COVID-19 Comparison](https://www.biospace.com/article/comparison-2003-sars-pandemic-vs-2020-covid-19-pandemic/)

Now you may be thinking? Market is mooning shut the fuck up. Hey, can’t fight the trend I personally will ride the momentum...just remember this is short sided thinking...the FED has never lost a battle yet. It also has never had an adversary quite like this; COVID-19 having the ability to permanently alter society and reduce economic productivity for a VERY long period of time. Florida reopens, more states to follow...and TRUMP has put us in the perfect spot to go through another shock and awe period.  Remember by no means think this is a short term play, ride the FED pump and bullish euphoria up to its highest levels. The second you start seeing headlines and hints of a second wave you put everything you have into shorting everything that requires a face to face interaction or a grouping of people (hotels, restaurants, retail, leasure, etc).

How does it work? You write a cash secured put as well as a call credit spread on a security. For instance, for the week that just passed, I wrote a 56.5 put on SQ and simultaneously sold the 61.5/62 call credit spread. I closed the spread at 50% profit.

For May 15, I’m looking at MSFT as well as MGM. Personally, I’m an ultra msft bull and wouldn’t mind getting assigned a 100 satya shares. I’m also happy holding MGM shares, and the IV for puts is crazy. Personally, for MGM, it seems that weekly options will also give you quite lucrative returns with relatively little risk. Twitter is also a good stock for this as well as AMD. Basically, you wanna do this on a stock u wouldn’t mind holding. I’m bullish on all the tickers above but also don’t wanna go full bull mode hence this mildly bullish trade. Puts still carry crazy premiums so take advantage of this.",2020-04-19 05:30:02,-1.0,0.0,0.0948638888888889,-0.30171203703703703

Very well positioned to weather the economic headwinds the market has been facing, due to its abundant cash position and sustainable margin improvement. It's been steadily going up even during the crisis. I know it's risky to buy Chinese stocks at the moment but that's precisely why it's so undervalued & a good opportunity

**Diageo (DEO):** Underpriced for literally no reason. People are consuming alcohol at the same rate as pre-coronavirus times. Their inventory costs are also low since distributors bear the burden of unsold goods. Soon with a potential lockdown end and summer months ahead, I can see their Q2 earnings skyrocketing.

**AerCap (AER):** Worlds largest aircraft leasing giant. Has $43b assets and owns the best fleet in the leasing industry. They are severely underpriced right now (60% less than where they were before the crisis) only because aviation industry took a hard hit. However they own more aircraft than any airline, and were offered shares from many airlines that are currently their customers and struggling with their lease payments (i.e., Norwegian airlines)

**Moderna (MRNA):** Everybody is betting on Gilead but I think they will be the ones to surface with a vaccine. Federal government just injected $485m fund into them. Dr. Fauci mentioned at a briefing that government can't afford to see if a vaccine works or not, and then place order of millions of it. It has to be ready as soon as all stages of clinical trial are finished (assuming the vaccine will work). Which makes me think government is all in on Moderna. 

Looking forward to your thoughts, challenge me!

Nothing fancy, and around half a year of options experience and I am also very bearish. Technical analysis obviously has some truth to it, it's a tool to allow more accurate decision making but is not an oracle which is why I wanted to question one of the points that continuously get brought up - **volume**. Before the black swan event SPY traded at 50million average, now it's at around 130 million average. Given that there hasn't been extreme bearish news lately, wouldn't it be normal for SPY to be trading at a lower volume? The way I see it SPY shouldn't have increased volume unless there is a reason to, for example - a large GDP decrease, unexpected terrible earnings, a major country going under a 2nd lockdown, mass bankruptcy or extending lockdowns even further. I do believe DOW will decrease in the future but unless a major event happens, I don't see why SPY would gap down a lot within 2-6 weeks since there is also a good chance none of those examples will happen in that timeframe. Insight would be much appreciated.

I believe everyone will be disappointed by their earnings report, and their stock will decrease right after earnings.

**Position:** I trade with a cash account, so no options. Bag holding an inverse daily index ETF position (not leveraged) that's down like 18k, and I'm crying everyday the market is rallying because of decay.

&#x200B;

**My Reasons:**

If you try to order from Amazon right now, it tells you 2-3 weeks estimated delivery time with/without prime, but the shit still comes pretty fast, like 3-4 days for most stuff that are considered non-essential. However the estimated delivery time is giving regular people the illusion that Amazon is busy af, and that their orders are through the roof, but I don't think it's the case. And they are reassuring themselves of the logic because ""everyone must be ordering Amazon right now"".

Are they busier than before? Yes. Are they busy enough to justify ATHs? I don't think so. However regular people that want to get into investing are seeing those long ass delivery times, thinks Amazon will crush their sales, and are FOMOing into buying them lately, driving the stock to ATHs.

As well, Amazon has shit profit margins outside of their own products, they make little margin on stuff such as toilet paper and essentials, which is what everyone is panic ordering. What they excel at is being as efficient as possible with their ordering/delivery system, which probably only got less efficient due to changes in people's ordering patterns, as well as having to conform to somewhat stricter sanitary regulations. This can also be seen again with their 3-4 weeks estimated delivery times, their algorithms to make shit as efficient as possible is not optimized right now, meaning their crap profit margin got crappier.

And before people talk about AWS, I understand people think every company and their grandma is upgrading their server capacity, but it's still a small % of their revenues, somewhere like 13% last year. As well, do you think every company is going to be flocking to upgrade their servers when their POS sales are dropping like a brick and they need to cut operating costs to offset it?

Disagree? Leave a comment and discuss. I'm not changing my position so I'm not going to be trading on this news, meaning I don't have skin in the game. Just want to hear other views.

Edit1: I am personally bullish on Amazon longterm, I think they will come out ahead in the future post-corvid because bigger companies are only going to get bigger. I'm merely talking about right now in the next two weeks. ",2020-04-19 02:32:24,0.9952,-0.25,0.4207620689655172,0.38865402298850577

Something similar might happen again.   The Fed has been reducing its level of asset purchases.   Eventually it will get to a point where they might be neutral or even reduce their balance sheet.   If this happens there might be a brief opportunity where the markets retrace down by 10%.   Unlike before I doubt it will go further than that.

Simply observing the [daily changes of SP500](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/price-history/historical) it is apparent to anyone who has autism that the feds time their ultimates perfectly, it is not known if their ultimates have a cooldown, but they time it perfectly and heres what I mean.

Every Thursday, unemployment numbers are released. The numbers have been ridiculous, and [news coverage about the bread line](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-poor/layoffs-and-food-lines-how-the-pandemic-slams-the-poorest-u-s-workers-idUSKBN21C1M6) seems to have [no apparent effect](https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/everything%20wrong%20with%20america.jpg?itok=YGKacJG_).

&#x200B;

It is apparent that every week, the Feds **MUST** release one piece of good news to the shareholders before the bad news and thats what creates the impression of bull weeks that we have been witnessing.

If we follow this theory, the most autistic strategy is to bank in on the fact that **the feds burn 1 ultimate every week between Wednesday and Thursday**.

&#x200B;

**How can we use this to our advantage?**

Feds need to time their ultimates so optimally we buy calls before they use it.

&#x200B;

**When will the Feds use their ultimate again?**

I don't know for sure, but here are some critical dates:

[GDP Estimates](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule) \- 4/29 08:30am, 4/30 08:30am

[Weekly Jobless Claims](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/laus.htm) \-Thursdays 08:30am

[FDA Approval Dates](https://www.fdatracker.com/fda-calendar/) \- These are the ultimate abilities that Feds have in their pocket, it doesn't matter if the drug works, they just need to make the headlines.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Buy calls every Wednesday morning, sell it once the Feds use their ultimate.

The US stock market is going up and up because there is no where else for the money to go.  The massive fed backstop that has been put in place has created a safe haven for the world.  Other countries and/or organizations are not doing infinite QE so why would people put their money somewhere else?  

This isn’t like 2008 because back then it was mostly a USA caused crisis, people could move their money to perhaps other safer locations and avoid the disaster.  In 2020 the whole world is fucked and the USA has created a safe haven among the destruction.  The FED is bankrolling the whole planet.  Also, the FED was much slower acting in 2008.  They've learned some lessons from then.

Amazon/Netflix and other techs are also at the same time gaining market share just due to their fundamental setup and people are seeing that.  The whole world is seeing that.  The stocks are going up so people keep dumping more in because its a safe bet and hence it goes up more, albeit on lower volume. 

So basically, the US market is going to keep rising until people find another safe haven, ie the virus is cured or another bank does infinite QE or.... everyone runs out of money and has to start selling shares to buy food/live.  For most investors running out of money is still probably a ways off.  Poor people without jobs or food probably aren’t sitting around day trading.

The more the fed spends the stronger the dollar becomes, for now...

I believe I understand why the rally has gone so far now. The optimism is that the FED and US government can support the economy for a few quarters and therefore it doesn't matter that 2020 earnings are a COMPLETE write off - investors are looking to 2021 earnings and trying to price those in and are optimistic we will have a quick bounce back in the economy and 2021 EPS will bounce back with it.

Therefore anything that puts 2021 earnings in jeopardy could cause a massive repricing of equities to the downside, and cause risk assets to converge with 2020 earnings expectations which have continued to fall even as the rally extends upwards. There is now a HUGE divergence between 2020 earnings expectations and equity prices.

Look at the divergence between 12m forward earnings expectations and the Nasdaq:

https://preview.redd.it/s3ix3726xkt41.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=59df183ccd225c91b1c8d3212a9941e7d0aa91f1

Another user has also pointed out the divergence between the VIX and realized vol in the S&P, there are an awful lot of divergences in the markets because of optimism about 2021 - vol remains high now but the consensus is that there will be lower vol in the future.

We are at a point in the market now where we are beginning to reprice equities for both effective treatment of the virus (remdesivir) and re-opening of the economy. If a second wave of infections does begin - even if it's not that many infections - it could really spook investors with equity prices where they are currently. That being said, I no longer thing we will see some dramatic random ""rug-pull"" out of nowhere, I think that equities are going to reprice in a nasty way if there is any meaningful second wave. Another user also pointed out that a secondary wave could occur in another country and paint a picture for the future - which could spook investors before a second wave in the USA.

Fellow gay bears, I think the truth is there needs to be a real catalyst for more downside - specifically something that spooks investors about 2021 earnings expectations. List of things this could be (feel free to think of your own):

1. Secondary wave(s) of infections
2. Lockdown/mass unemployment continues for approx another 60 days which would mark the end of ""90-day grace period for credit card, mortgage and auto loan/lease payments"" - [JPM Q1 2020 earnings presentation](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/investor-relations/document/b087dc23-d2fd-4dd7-8022-c3ca70e7e46f.pdf)causing a lot of defaults. I'm assuming grace periods are similar at other major banks.
3. Increasing bankruptcy rates of businesses causing damage to long term economic growth prospects.
4. Firms start to be more pessimistic in their guidance about growth prospects for the next 24 months.
5. It becomes apparent that the FED and US government no longer have the capacity to support the economy for the next 1 to 2 quarters (not very likely).
6. Virus mutation/new strains.

Think I'm going to sell all my May 15th puts and roll them into June/July.

TL;DR: Investors are very optimistic about 2021 earnings - that doesn't mean they are wrong, but if there is a second wave of infections or similar catalyst its going to be ugly ... for the bulls ;) . But until that happens STONKS ONLY GO UP, MONEY PRINTER GO BRRR etc. Or I'm completely wrong and we circuit breaker on Monday, honestly who the fuck knows.

The banks are in charge of giving out the money the govt gave them. We’re seeing reports of banks fucking over businesses or people who don’t hold debt in their bank. Market manipulation at the hands of Gilead and the president. 

What we’re going to likely see.

Small businesses are going to be left to flounder and die. The bigger players either know this or even helped coordinate it. Assets and markets are going to be cheap in the near future. Things like family restaurants are going be turned into fast food places, stuff like that. Companies that can capitalize on that, like amazon, will go straight to the moon. Private healthcare will shoot straight for Mars, right behind Elon, because public healthcare will be rammed harder than someone buying TSLA puts. Tech companies have already and will continue to make a killing off of consumer fears of being in public. 

We may not see one big recession at all. Rather a bunch of smaller ones spread out over a longer period. The service and retail sectors were the first to go. Next will be manufacturers because their value comes from having made product, and it’s only a matter of time before the efficiencies of these companies catch up to them and they hit the red. Housing market will be down by September as the vast majority of household do not have 6 months rent on hand. The cashflow will be dead.

It takes months for the consequences to really set in. The banks know this after 08. If they gamed the system before, they’ll keep doing it so long as they think it’ll make money. Short term, stonks up. Anything after July, stonks down.

1. People are convinced that the worst is over... many believe that everything will soon return to ""normal"". While this may or may not be true... there's no reason not to buy in at these levels.
2. While some tech stocks may have a recovered too quickly, many other industries are still cheap.
3. Stocks are forward looking - sure, Q2 / Q3 earnings will suffer.. but companies like Apple & Amazon aren't going anywhere. Think ""long-term earnings potential""
4. I do believe a correction will occur at some point, but I don't believe it will happen next week... there's simply too much upward momentum right now

1. Dow is lagging because financial sector hasn't fully recovered

I was doing some DD on this lovely evening after watching “The Big Short” for about the 5th time. I was inspired by the Mortgage Based Securities bailout of the Financial Crisis and was trying to find something that had not been touched by the Fed’s outstretched arms. 

I happened upon the auto market. Yes, one might say, “but sir papa Powell already issued asset backed securities in the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).” I would say you are quite right, but what about the upcoming demand for future vehicles.  Sure airlines, hotels and cruise lines will have a hard time getting demand back, but what about the purchase or lease of a car? That is a major purchase that I don’t think many autists are willing to acquire in the foreseeable future. 

With that, I did some research and found out that GM Financial revenue is about 3% of revenue for GM which I know doesn’t sound like much but it’s about 4 billion in total revenue. So, I thought if people lease less cars it’s going to hurt GM’s bottom line, right? And worst comes to worst demand will surely decrease for direct selling of cars so GM will be hurt. 

But then I remembered about my King in DC, Jerome H. Powell. He told me one time that stonks only go up and that he will print ungodly amounts of money to make sure that happens. 


I have come to the conclusion like many autists that it is an univestable US equity market and that the best move is to get out now. But I will continue to buy my $SPY 9/30 275p and kill myself, but what’s an autist to do?",2020-04-20 06:32:48,0.9998,-0.5574,-0.5280960396039605,-0.02856534653465348

505,DD,"AMZN/SHOP - The Fundamental shift towards Ecommerce, SHOP to double",88,g4fbd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4fbd8/amznshop_the_fundamental_shift_towards_ecommerce/,124,1587358700.0,"TLDR; There is a massive shift to E-commerce under way across all demographics, and especially under boomers and older people who have resisted online buying. With the spread of the virus, these demographics are shifting to online buying, expanding the market by 50%. Younger people ordering online are doing it even more. The sector will see long term extreme growth. Sales profits will consolidate under SHOP and AMZN. SHOP will double.

Basically right now, as stocks recover, we are going to see a fundamental repricing of companies. Some will be worth more and some worth less, as the economy and the way that people buy and communicate changes. The post pandemic economy will be different, understanding this is where the huge economic opportunity lays. Online sales profits will moon, and the profits consolidate under AMZN and SHOP. 

Shopify is poised to see massive growth as a result. They were already booming, with their previous ATH at 593, they sit at 590 right now. The stock was already on a massive bull run with SHOP before this shift to online buying. With the addressable market for ecommerce effectively doubling over night, SHOP is STILL underpriced. 

How do I know this? AMZN did not start to boom on this until recently announcing they were hiring 100k employees, and then 75k more. This sent their stock booming last week. The market had not priced that in until literally LAST week. It’s still early on these stocks. 

SHOP is basically an index for ecommerce. Going forward, holding shopify is like holding an index on small and medium size businesses selling online. They have extremely low capital requirements, can scale basically immediately as they hold no merchandise, get a cut of every transaction. This is a dream stock.

PROOF:

“As we help thousands of businesses to move online, our platform is now handling Black Friday level traffic every day! 

It won't be long before traffic has doubled or more.”
Shopify CTO - https://twitter.com/jmwind/status/1250816681024331777

Offhand comments from hacker news:

“I am presently scaling a client on Shopify who started at a 30k a month ad budget. Today we scaled past $8,000 per day (So a little under 250k a month). I fully expect and we'll hit $500,000 a month in ad spend for them monthly probably in the next 2 weeks. The combination of increased screen time and major companies pulling ad dollars has cratered media prices, and in the process, created a once in a decade opportunity for DTC brands that have cash on hand and are ready to scale up production. This announcement from Shopify themselves surprises me not at all.”

“Same here. We have provide a warehouse management system specifically for e-commerce warehouses, as SaaS. We are (one of) the biggest player in the Netherlands, and since ""social distancing"" started here 4 weeks ago we see Black Friday 2019 levels of orders every day, for 4 weeks straight now.
We have some customers that saw there orders come to a stop, even a few bankruptcies already. But almost all see a 30-40% bigger order flow. Some customers that sell DIY hair products see a doubling or tripling in orders per day and revenue.
When I talk to the biggest e-commerce players in the Netherlands and the top 3 parcel shippers, they all see (near) black friday levels of orders/shipments.”

The best part is it doesnt matter if the virus wrecks the economy, sales and profits will consolidate under AMZN and SHOP.

If not Monday, within the next 3 weeks. I expect new lows within 2 months and I expect the S&P will hit 1000-1500 within the next 18 months. Unfortunately, we are potentially looking at massive permanent changes in the structure of our society. There will be no ""V"" shaped recovery. Settle in, it's a long read.

**The Virus was man-made (Genetically Modified)**

Here you go: [https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part.\_the-end%29](https://project-evidence.github.io/#%28part._the-end%29)

My personal belief is that they were experimenting with the ability for Bats to carry the virus without getting sick. Apparently the Navy carrier that had a huge outbreak has a 60% rate of asymptomatic cases. South Korea has a bunch of positive cured cases. A homeless shelter in Boston just had a ton of cases with zero having symptoms. We really don't know what will happen to them in the long run - will their immune systems just kill the virus? Will they spread it unknowingly for weeks, or will it reappear months or years later? Will they suddenly turn symptomatic at some point or become more or less susceptible to wave 2 or other diseases? The long term effects are unknown and that is a risk.

Also the scientist who discovered Aids also believes it is man-made [https://www.zerohedge.com/health/covid-19-man-made-virus-hiv-discoverer-says-could-only-have-been-created-lab](https://www.zerohedge.com/health/covid-19-man-made-virus-hiv-discoverer-says-could-only-have-been-created-lab)

**The Vaccine isn't coming**

Vaccine's aren't easy to make. Is there a vaccine for AIDS or the Common Cold? Also, this virus is spreading quickly which is making it more likely to mutate. In fact, there are already tons of mutations which makes it exponentially more difficult. All this talk about one in the works is mostly just hope, providing an excuse to pump the market. On the positive side, the scientific community seems to believe that it is more likely that it will mutate into a less deadly form, like the common cold.

Also the treatments that are being hyped may not work as effectively as hoped. The Gilead action was clearly a fake pump and Remdesivir has been known for a couple months as a potential treatment, but not a cure all. Hydroxychloroquine may help but studies are mixed, such as [this report from Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-15/hyped-malaria-pill-doesn-t-help-clear-coronavirus-in-study?utm_content=business&utm_medium=social&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic) just this morning. Again, it's not a miracle cure.

**Rolling Lockdowns**

The lockdowns aren't meant to eradicate the virus. They are meant to control it and allow the healthcare system to handle the stress. Some areas may contain the outbreak but probably only temporarily. And even if entire countries get it under control, they will need to keep their borders shut to avoid another outbreak. Good luck getting the virus under control in poor countries, especially when the wealthy countries are trying to contain it themselves. Look at all the lockdown protestors out and about lately? Does that look like a lockdown to you? It looks like the start of a another wave to me. Global travel is essentially dead and trade is severely impacted.

When the politicians say the lockdowns will be in place for another month, they really don't know. They hope that will happen but most likely they will just keep moving out the date. And they know that if there is another outbreak, the lockdown becomes wasted.

What this also implies is that unless we can come up with a vaccine, this is our new reality, possibly for a few years. Otherwise, we will eventually reach herd immunity or it will be contained but I estimate it will come at a cost of a death rate of 1% to 3% of the global population.

**BRRRR Money Printing and Inflation**

Without the Fed directly buying stocks, there is no real money moving directly into stocks. The Fed doesn't want hyperinflation and they don't want deflation either. They want stability and control. Even if they were buying stocks, that doesn't mean the market has to go up. Just look at how that is working out for the BoJ who has been buying ETF's for years.

The amount of stimulus thus far isn't enough to spark major inflation. It may be enough to prevent deflation but it's still early to tell. Everyone thought we would have massive inflation in 2008 but that didn't materialize because of the trickle up effect. You may think the $1200 stimulus and unemployment benefits will have an impact; they won't. Once people panic buy at temporarily high prices, there will be an oversupply of junk we don't need, thus once again, preventing inflation.

Also some food for thought - What asset class will benefit from deflation? Bonds, specifically treasuries. What does the Fed mostly own? Bonds. What asset class gets wrecked with inflation? Bonds. Do you really think the Fed wants inflation?

**Debt and Share Issuance and the Impact on EPS and future EPS**

All of these companies getting bailouts and issuing more debt and shares to raise capital are all taking a bite out of their future earnings. Recession/Depression/Expansion whatever, if you double your share count, EPS is cut in half and it takes years to even get it back to what it was before. Debt leads to the same problem as share raises. That debt is eating away at earnings and forcing the company to repay debt instead of buyback shares. And as you may realize, buybacks have been a major driver for higher EPS and share prices over the past number of years. This is now over. This is why I am comfortable being short even if I am ultimately wrong. The upside is limited. I think Dip Buyers at this level are forgetting about this.

**The Psychological Aspect**

Whether or not a person or business survives this period in time, they will be permanently scarred. Everyone is impacted. Those who lost jobs, those who watched their investments crash, those who got sick or knew someone who passed. Everyone will or has gotten hurt. This applies to finance because people will now want a bigger safety net and this is a good thing. But it comes at the cost of deleveraging - paying down debt and making less risky investments. And deleveraging is not good for the stock market and economy. The psychological impact also carries over to...

**Real Estate, WFH and other Trends**

A lot of people are realizing that working in an office is not necessary. This will cause a permanent decrease in the demand for offices. Retail is also impacted and although the demand loss might not be as big or as permanent, the short term effects are much stronger due to all the bankruptcies and closures.

AirBnB's are also screwed. No one is renting them now and some of the owners are over-leveraged and will now be forced to sell or rent. If they rent it out, they are probably no longer cash flowing after debt servicing. Also most major cities rely on property prices increasing to justify investment as most condo units don't cashflow with a mortgage.

And lastly, the fact that so many businesses and people have already not paid rent in Month 1 of the lockdowns is a very ominous sign. Residential real estate will also take a hit

The Real Estate market is much bigger than the stock market and the debt that backs it up is equally as massive. What happens when the lockdown is over and people and companies start selling their real estate holdings?

**Fundermentals**

We have witnessed an era of record high valuation metrics for a number of years now. Do you really think we deserve to have those same metrics in an era of uncertainty and sharp revenue drops? Valuations will come back to earth.

**Tech and the Nasdaq will Fail**

Eventually, fundamentals will matter for Tech. Although these companies will survive, they will be punished. Google, which derives about 80% of its revenue from advertising will see those revenues evaporate. Advertising is an easy expense for most companies to cut. I could see advertising revenue drop by 20 to 50%. Facebook has the same problem. Apple can feel the pain in multiple ways - supply chain disruptions, cost conscious consumers and margin compression. Netflix and Amazon will both do relatively well. But how do you justify buying those if Apple drops to a 10x P/E for example? All tides rise and fall.

**Banks**

I was going to do a big write up on banks but this guy already did so I won't bother:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3tdko/welcome\_to\_the\_liquidity\_trap/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g3tdko/welcome_to_the_liquidity_trap/)

TLDR: Everyone will soon want to hoard cash (or pay down debt) and this translates to deflation as well. Also I believe JPM just stopped approving new HELOCS.

**Warren Buffet is not buying to save America**

In fact, he is raising cash and selling some stakes. Berkshire's insurance business will likely struggle and some of the weaker businesses will be closed entirely. They won't be buying until valuations are much cheaper to justify the extreme risk.

**VT World 50% Retracement**

Many people are using the Dow or S&P to determine levels that may create or support or resistance and start a reversal. What these technicians fail to realize is that this is a global pandemic and thus the global market is a much better indicator. Unlike 2008/2009, it's not just US Banks and a few other places that overleveraged - China was and emerged as a key component of the recovery. This time, China is at the epicentre of the problem and although the virus has faded in China, their economic problems are just beginning.

The World is now at the 50% retracement level. It closed at $68.11 and the exact 50% retracement is $68.47. It may have already hit this in theory when it was closed and futures spiked Thursday night/Friday morning. Or it may hit it this in the upcoming week and then retrace.

**SPY's Friday After Hours Close $286.66**

SPY's all time high was 339.08. S&P's 2009 low was 666.79. Notice all the multiples of 3? This is how the real insiders mark their charts and signal each other to indicate reversals and advances. I'm not saying the selling starts Monday, but I'd say within the next couple of days, maybe weeks.

**And some Advice:**

Stop buying naked, short dated calls and puts. It's so easy for the market makers to screw you. Let me give you a simplified example of how easy it is: 2 market participants, each with $1MM. Player A thinks the market will go down, so he buys $1MM worth of puts. Player 2 sells him those puts, collecting $1MM in premium. Player 2 then buys $2MM worth of stock. Stock goes up due to no selling pressure, puts expire worthless. Obviously simple but think about it. Instead, buy longer dated options, use spreads, etc.

**TLDR** \- Stonks going down. All time highs are years away. Downside Risk is much higher than the upside. The next couple of years will be miserable for everyone.",2020-04-20 00:26:32,-1.0,-0.9992,0.02776064516129035,-0.6571464516129032

Hey WSB! I love this sub so much so thanks for being hilarious, retarded, smart, autistic and everything in between. Today I just wanted to share my perspective on a where we stand in the market. I'll start by saying I'm not an expert, I'm a business person in his thirties who has built his business from nothing to being a multi million dollar revenue business.

**""Be fearful when others are greedy"" - When I look at the market today I see a whole lot of greed.** On March 20th to 23rd the bears were greedy ( I was one of them and I've learned my lesson) but now I can say that I think the bulls are getting greedy.

**""Buy the rumor, sell the news""** \- I was looking at back at what was the exact day that I closed my stores because of Covid and the date was Mar. 20th. Just a few day before my province (I'm in Canada) made it mandatory. This also happened to be the same time that the market was bottoming. If I had been smart as a bear I would've bought the rumor that businesses were going to shut down (by buying puts) and sold the news when the businesses actually closed (by selling my puts and going long).

Hindsight is 20/20 as they say but I'm not going to make this mistake again. I think today we can put buy the rumor and sell the news to our advantage again. I believe that the second half of this rally has been investors buying the rumor that we're going to start slowly reopening the economy. I don't know if you guys saw the link below but based on this MIT model and honestly just common sense IMHO I just don't see how we reopen without having a second surge. Alternatively we don't reopen and the economy will be hit even more.

[http://news.mit.edu/2020/new-model-quantifies-impact-quarantine-measures-covid-19-spread-0416](http://news.mit.edu/2020/new-model-quantifies-impact-quarantine-measures-covid-19-spread-0416)

**Even when we do reopen it won't be at full capacity.** As the owner of several retail stores I would love to believe more than anyone that once we start reopening there will be so much pent up demand and we will be back to normal before we know it. I just don't see it! For my business we plan to bring staff back in stages because it wouldn't be wise of us to bring everyone back all at once. Realistically a good 25% of my staff won't be brought back.

**Businesses can't pay their bills.** We're a small business that was both quite lean and conservatively ran and yet we owe vendors thousands of dollars that we just don't have. This has to do with the cyclical nature of the golf business (buy a bunch of golf clubs in the late winter, sell them in the spring / summer) but still I'm sure there are literally millions of business that owe bigger businesses money and when that starts to rear its ugly head in the numbers it ain't going to be pretty.

I especially see greed in the technology sector. I know that obviously the FAANG's are the ones owe stand to come out the best on the other side of this but I also know that the market tends to overshoot to the downside and to the upside. I was fine with QQQ's valuation until the end of last week. You mean to tell me that 8% down from the already overvalued ATH's we were at is a fair valuation? I get the lesser of two evils idea that there are very few places to park your money right now that are safe but I still think we're over extended on the QQQ.

Realistically the market could go up a BIT from here given the momentum but I don't see a world where we see spy break through 300. I would have short positions right now and put more in as we hit 290, 295 and then go all in a 300.

What doesn't make sense to me, is how you can justify these all time highs on Amazon or Netflix, but at the same time assume the markets will continue to pump as a result of the economy reopening.

Neiman Marcus is in the final stages of negotiating a loan with its creditors totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, which would sustain some of its operations during bankruptcy proceedings, according to the sources. It has also furloughed many of its roughly 14,000 employees.

1. Be adaptive to the market. Failure to adapt leads to extinction - **Todd Harrison**
2. Never trade in situations you don’t have control. I don’t risk significant amounts of money in front of key reports since that is gambling, not trading. - **Paul Tudor Jones**
3. If you have a losing position that is making you uncomfortable, get out. Because you can always get back in - **Paul Tudor Jones**
4. Everything gets destroyed a hundred times faster than it is built up - **Paul Tudor Jones**
5. You always want to be with whatever the predominant trend is - **Paul Tudor Jones**
6. Beware of Wall Street Hype - **Jim Cramer**

7. Don’t try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. This can’t be done — except by liars - **Bernard Baruch**

8. Learn how to take your losses quickly and cleanly. Don’t expect to be right all the time. If you have made a mistake, cut your losses as quickly as possible - **Bernard Baruch**

9. There is nothing new on Wall Street. There can’t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again, mostly due to human nature - **James P. Arthur Huprich**

10. Understanding mass psychology is just as important as understanding fundamentals and economics - **James P. Arthur Huprich**

11. Even the best looking chart can fall apart for no apparent reason. Thus, never fall in love with a position but instead remain vigilant in managing risk and expectations. Use volume as a confirming guidepost - **James P. Arthur Huprich**

12. Never let a profitable trade turn into a loss, and never let an initial trading position turn into a long-term one because it is at a loss - **James P. Arthur Huprich**

13. Human emotion is a big enemy of the average investor and trader. Be patient and unemotional. There are periods where traders don’t need to trade - **James P. Arthur Huprich**

14. Where there is smoke, there is fire, or there is never just one cockroach: In other words, bad news is usually not a one-time event, more usually follows - **James P. Arthur Huprich**

15. Technical analysis is a windsock, not a crystal ball. It is a skill that improves with experience and study. Always be a student, there is always someone smarter than you - **James P. Arthur Huprich**

16. This time is never different - **James Montier**

17. Buy that which is showing strength – sell that which is showing weakness. The public continues to buy when prices have fallen. The professional buys because prices have rallied. The rule of survival is not to “buy low, sell high”, but to “buy higher and sell higher.” - **Richard Rhodes**

18 Markets form their tops in violence; markets form their lows in quiet conditions **- Richard Rhodes**

19. Speculate with less than 10% of your liquid net worth. Risk less than 1% of your speculative account on a trade. This tends to keep the fluctuations in the trading account small, relative to net worth **- Ed Seykota**

20. I usually ignore advice from other traders, especially the ones who believe they are on to a “sure thing”. The old timers, who talk about “maybe there is a chance of so and so,” are often right and early - **Ed Seykota**

The WSB classic: **If you can’t take a small loss, sooner or later you will take the mother of all losses- Ed Seykota**

**tl;dr**  Go against the trend, don’t have patience, use all your capital at once, let hope decide your trades, never takes a loss, if you know something for sure then it has to be true: Go all in.

There are many post here, which logically makes sense i.e  to buy puts or have a negative view on the markets. Shorting stocks or index in a time of unresolved COVID issue seems a no brainer. Airlines, hotels, cruiselines, automotives and a wide variety of other business that have lost or are losing customers and revenue, or even facing bankruptcy seems like once in a lifetime opportunity to make a hundred thousand odd dollars or two by shorting the stocks or the index. 

But in reality, many of the bearish traders have lost their shirt and are now bruised bears. Just think about this from another point of view. For every trader buying puts, there is also an option seller. The option seller is just as informed if not more than the put buyer.  This is because as a seller, he is taking a huge risk on the downside for a limited amount of premium. Now why would he do that? Or ask yourself, what information, data, insight  or strategy an option seller has that gives him the confidence to sell puts when there is a negative perception of stocks in the market?

From what has happened till now, it would seem that the option sellers had factored in profit booking of shorts, short covering of bears, the stimulus and money printing machine from the Fed etc. which has led to a sharp pull back in the market resulting in many a bears to lose their shirt.

For making money in the market, a trader needs to align himself to the market sentiments and not fight it. Hence, logic alone cannot be the criteria to trade. Market timing is also important. and there will be opportunity to short. The market will give clues. Once there is limited upmoves, or congestion on the upside, bears will take control of the situation. It is at that time an individual trader can take a position which is in line with market sentiments and logic. Trading on the basis of only having a logical and rational view is highly risky if not supported by market data/charts in the short term. 

Hence, study of market sentiments besides rational and logic is also necessary. 

Hence believe that besides logic and reasoning, trading in line with the market sentiments (and not against it) is the way to make money.",2020-04-19 17:35:33,-0.9999,0.0,0.17882923497267766,-0.27369025500910743

An 8% loss in the value of assets held on Household balance sheet will be greater than the loss of asset values during 2007-09 in dollar terms.

Estimation of equity allocation to total assets on balance sheet of households is 22%, or roughly $30 trillion by the way of direct ownership, Mutual Funds, and Pension Entitlements.

Taking into consideration draw downs on deposit  accounts, losses in home values, proprietors’ equity, etc. I suspect a decline in asset values on Household balance sheets to be between 15-20%, or $21 to $27 trillion. This results in declines in assets on household balance sheets of 90-154% greater than 2007-09.

Edit: for context, the loss mentioned above would still put household asset values well above 2007 peaks. My worst expectation would imply asset values on household balance sheets are reduced to a total of $108 trillion. At the peak of asset values in 2007, the amount was $85 trillion.

Edit 2: I expect the decline in the value of assets on household balance sheets to primarily be in the financial category, as opposed to non-financial category (e.g. real estate), given current asset composition.

Strong indicator that there is about to be a big drawn down of value among the top five. But given the circumstances, how will it play out the next ten years? What will be the top five ten years from now?

Amazon: Seems best positioned for success given e-commerce and cloud are their two biggest businesses.

Microsoft: Also looks to be on solid footing given cloud and collaboration apps. Only company that was a top 5 in the early 2000s as well. Has proven it can reinvent itself.

Apple: Has a ton of cash on the sidelines but current outlook doesn’t look great, as people will probably delay buying new hardware for a year or two, or buy the cheaper options they are rolling out. A lot of supply chain exposure to China, and we could see a lot of that brought back home for security / political / unemployment reasons, which will eat at their margins.

Google and Facebook: I think the least well positioned. I work in digital advertising and am seeing budgets cut left and right. Search activity is almost directly tied to demand for products, and given this is a demand-side crisis that doesn’t bode well for Google. Facebook might be in a better spot since people are glued to social media, which is an opportunity for creative advertisers to sell them shit.

Yeah, duh, millions are and many of those will get back to work. That is why I say 10(!) million will get their jobs back instantly. But you’re too autistic to read that far! However, maaany companies will not take back their full 100% workforce because demand will still be subdued for a long time. A restaurant might take back 30% and run a skeleton crew. 

Learn how to read and I’ll try and use your retarded American English the way you want me to. Apparently 20 inches of jobs didn’t make sense to you for some reason. 

https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet

So that was the fastest growth ever in the US for a single month. The following months was above average at 300k+. Adjusting for population that would equate to 1,6” jobs added in one month. We have no idea how the job market will act once restrictions begin to lift but it would be reasonable to assume we get an initial boom in employment followed by a slower pace.

Just for fun, let’s do some massive assumptions:

Job losses stops at 30” (two more weeks of losses.. that is optimistic in other words) 

Initial boom is 10” for the first month
4” second month
3” third month
2” fourth
1,6” fifth
This leaves us with 9,4” still unemployed
Follow that up with a slower but still accelerated pace of 400k/month on average it would take an additional 24 months to get back.
All in all 29 months to get back to 4% unemployment

So what does this tell us? **Even if we “only” get another 8” jobs lost AND the first five months have an average 12,5x ***(10+4+3+2+1,6=20,6/1,6=12,5)* **the previous RECORD monthly job growth we could still be looking at 2,5 years before we are back at previous levels...**. And those are optimistic numbers I would argue.

This at the same time as the rest of the world is trying to do the same. Way more added debt on corporate and national level from already record highs. Fear/caution regarding a second wave. A consumer that dramatically increases their savings-rate (paying off debt / regular savings) as always happens after a crisis. All of this in an economy (the US) that is 70% consumer driven.

TLDR: it’s fucked up. A depression scenario is the most likely for a few years. How this is still assumed by the markets to get a U- (or even V-!) shaped recovery is insane.

1) The huge and rapid sell of mid-March was not just corona, it was also a liquidity crisis that had been brewing since the FED started QE and Repo back in Sept. The rapid economic downturn and JPows printer jumped in hard and fast, providing liquidity for markets. That solved an issue that was a big force driving the sell off and has been a huge source of anxiety of the markets pre/corona. If you think corona was the only thing that produced multiple circuit breakers in March than you are stupid and there’s no help. 

2) People really do believe that the fundamentals of the world economy and international market systems are not on par with 2008, which was a real financial crisis of epic proportions. Not just the flu with paranoia as a symptom. A leading component of the massive March sell-off was the idea that a recession was in order.

I’ve driven by multiple car dealerships in the past few days and you know what they are advertising? 64-80 months of 0% APR on cars. What does that tell you? People think that once the virus has calmed down, people are going to go bananas over lower interest rates and start buying shit like crazy. 

3) In sum, the virus is overblown and the Fed’s actions have, inadvertently, helped continue a massive bull run. They’ve solved the liquidity crisis that came with the Fed’s plans to roll back QE and repo in April (originally proposed in beginning of Feb, before the virus really hit american markets) and the market panic of March. 

So what we might be seeing is the groundwork being laid for another bull run and a massive bubble. 
V shaped recovery. 

***Bear case*** 

1) the virus is actually quite bad and opening up the economy will not immediately result in everyone having their jobs back. If the economy even opens back up. Huge unemployment numbers plus the Fed’s desire to reduce the levels of QE and Repo and Bond purchases, will re-introduce the liquidity issue, which combined with huge unemployment numbers, will result in another leg down. 

2) solvency issues. How many companies are about to go bankrupt? If movie theaters cannot open until the fall, then Hollywood is down the shitter. Just think about all of those companies with terrible balance sheets, debt that they cannot pay back, negative cash flow (cough Seaworld cough), we will see sectors of the economy, and the millions of jobs attached to them, drop like a lead ballon. 

Conclusion: 

Bull case; coronavirus induced massive and unprecedented action by the Fed, which has inadvertently given new legs for another bull run. That’s all premised on most of the economy and most people getting back to work, having money, and being able to buy cars, max our credit cards, get loans, and buy homes, at historically retarded low interest levels. 

Bear case: Certain industries are beyond fucked and they will tank, and when they tank, unemployment will continue to stay high, which means no one will be able to take advantage of historically low levels of interest rates. They won’t be buying shit cause they got no jobs. Which will result in loan defaults and a real financial crisis. 

I’m leaning toward the bear case this week. But I know JPow and his unlimited printers will come out with something novel and unprecedented which will give rise to another short term bull run. 

But it all depends on if people will actually get their jobs back. Unemployment numbers haven’t tanked the market yet, but that moment is coming, I think. You cannot have these levels of unemployment and markets rising forever. Unless we reopen big and soon.

If my investment thesis is true, I believe there is still time for money to be made in the interim, especially in markets such as oil. Despite the inevitability of the next stock market crash, I believe we're a good 3-12 months out. First and foremost, let me start off by saying that I could't give two fucks about your short term SPY put predictions. You should've rolled down ya momma's leg when you were born. I believe your autistic investment logic just as much as I believe my wife when she says she didn't fuck Darrell. YEAH RIGHT BITCH, I HEARD YOU MOANING WHEN DARRELL BENT YOU OVER LAST NIGHT, AND YOU LET HIM PLOW YOU HARDER THAN THOSE AUTIST BEARS GOT PLOWED BY THEIR MOTHERFUCKING $200 SPY PUTS THESE PAST TWO WEEKS! Alrighty then, I'm sorry to get side tracked, my ADHD makes me sped sometimes. I've had a long ass day and I can feel the Ritalin starting to ware off, lets not waste anymore time. 

Personally I have reason to believe that the oil industry will be bullish following the recent contago. Despite the concurrent WTI, I think we'll be boomin come fall time. I know everybody is talking about oil tanker and oil ETF calls, but what about the actual oil companies? I think two companies that are being overlooked right now are Apache Corp ($APA) and Oneok ($OKE). Firstly, Oneok is extremely undervalued right now, [they](https://dwinnex.com/2020/04/17/oneok-inc-oke-increased-bullish-sentiment-favors-oke-the-most/) ""appear to be a solid investment option, with Wall Street analysts expecting its price to rise considerably in the next 12 months. This company generates high value from the labor resources and other capital it has available, and while it has heavy Long-Term Debt to Equity, the majority of the metrics point to this investment being highly attractive"". Now let's talk about Apache. I know Apache recently bottomed hard, and I know their recently accrued debt doesn't make them look too hot either, but to say they are done with is premature. They are sitting on top of a mountain of liquid gold, and nobody is talking about [it](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Apache+Corp.+%28APA%29+Announces+Significant+Oil+Discovery+Offshore+Suriname+at+Sapakara+West-1/16699833.html). Wouldn't you now say that they are positioned to flourish long term? Now I know what you're about to say next, I understand that there is an abundance of oil yet a lack of demand for it concurrently. Here's the thing, the American people are ready to jump back on the Hamster wheel and get the economy up and running again, remember,  those boomer fucks 401Ks are bleeding, and they're terrified. Once the economy is reopened, a good 50% of those ""unemployed"" will jump back into the job market - in case it isn't clear enough yet, the vacancy is fundamentally a result of the federally mandated social distancing practices, and thus it is only temporary. Once companies are back in business, oil consumption will increase. I see the merit in the philosophy that the oil markets are at an all-time low: simply put, ""buy the dip"". Due to the circumstances contrived by beer virus, they will inevitably go up as the necessary demand increases.

So I'm going to repost it here for your benefit. Keep in mind, it's a very dumbed down analogy.* 

If you are considering USO, please understand 

#The Mango Contango:

- You are looking to buy mangoes next month. You have $100, and each mango futures contract is $10. You now have 10 mangoes you plan on buying, congratulations. 

- The month is about to roll over, and you realize ""shit I don't need these mangoes right now! I will next month, though!"" Bad news! Your contracts have gone down by $1, and are now worth $9, so you sell them to some fool for $90. Shame, you lost $10, but you're sure it'll bounce back.

- Well! Good news, or so you think... The contracts for the following months are actually worth $15 because there's expected to be a shortage! However, you only have $90 now... so you can only buy 6 contracts this time.

- You decide to hold on and see if you can make your money back. You wait another month. You were right! The mangoes futures for the *next* month have gone up EVEN FURTHER! $20! However, because you only hold 6 contracts now, you are actually only up $20 total, even though mangoes are DOUBLE what you originally bought the contracts for.

This is the mango contango. And this is how contango fucks your ass in USO. Enjoy!

**IN ADDITION**: If every single month going forward has more expensive contracts (i.e., if the price of oil keeps going up *GRADUALLY*), you will most likely lose money EVEN IF oil is more than it was the day you got into USO. In order to reverse this trend and actually profit, oil would need to absolutely skyrocket in the middle of one of the current contracts. So you're pretty much gambling on a big maybe happening.

TL;DR - USO is not your buddy, pal.",2020-04-21 06:48:50,0.9999,-0.296,0.07062317073170733,0.25817439024390243

How does this happen? Why does this happen?

Simple, we want to see something happen that we personally believe in, but shouldn't financially believe in. 

Now what should we look for? What should we believe in? 

Really fucking simple actually: Don't pay attention to the news. Do NOT trade the news. Never trade the fucking news. Do one thing only. Look at price action. If you can't see why something large is going up (not some shitter penny stock), why SPY isn't passing 2820 when Oil went to fucking -35$, it means that the Sellers aren't ready yet. They still buy, go look at dark pools. Buying is still happening. 

What can cause SPY to stay up? Look at Oil for June, barely crossed $21 a barrel. Stabilized around 21.17. Dark pools are going down but not enough. We aren't breaching 2820 by much, yet. Can we go red tomorrow? Sure. In my view we are going to be green off stim, oil going up/stabilizing, and again, dark pools STILL buying.

Will we drop soon? Yeah, my view is that 2925 mark is where we decide on 3000 or 2750 (or way way below, but we don't do that math yet).

Stop reading shit here that confirms bias. Stop bagholding to -99%. Start entering stop losses. Don't take DD as be all end all. Learn how to read some indicators. Find SMART people to talk to. Literally the only thing that saved my portfolio was blocking out all the noise and focusing on price action and whatnot.

Price will create the news, not news creating the price. Events are the catalyst, nothing else. Think otherwise? How are we fucking not -5% limit down after oil went negative? How are we still going up for ""no reason?"" 

Lots of questions, only order flow, price action, and understanding the really really big picture can give you a glimpse. Bet with the smart money, don't try to beat it.

This means someone was willing to pay you $40,320 per contract to take 1000 barrels deliverd. Seems great and all, everyone gets paid, you store them in your garage or whatever, but there is an underlying issue here... storage.

Generally, retail paper traders are not trading this contract, most brokerages won’t even allow you to trade the front month after last week. You would be forced to trade the forward (June) /CLM20 or later. People trading today are actual physical buyers and sellers, large companies needing to move physical oil. For it to go negative means a lot of people were on the phones calling around trying to find space to store said oil, and they couldn’t find the space for that oil, which drove the price negative just so they could unload the contract. Who cares right?

We should all care... why? Government has extended DoD Travel Ban to June 30 so you can be sure if they are banning non essential travel through June 30 they are likely going to ban people from coming into the work place (that cube life, the resurgence of COVID)... Travel by plane and commuting to work... the two biggest reasons for oil/gas... They have been on hold for about 1.5 months and now the government is stating that they will be on hold for another 2 months at least. Now lets not even talk about heating oil needed for the northern areas coming into spring…

You cant keep pumping oil if you have no demand for it, and you have no place to store it, although the later is more important. If you pump it, where do you put it? As I said before, to go -$40 today it means people were calling everything they could think of (container ships, tanker trucks, strategic reserve, out of the way storage facilities, etc) before they absorb a $40K loss per contract (and they sell thousands).

What must happen next, which little demand is they must idle the pumps. They cant and wont pay oil workers $100K a year to sit around with an idle pump. We have about 10M oil workers in the US. We are potentially looking at 80% of those to be laid off… and this will take months to go through existing inventory if its completely full. This will extend for months, likely into Q4 2020, even Q1 2021.

As a result of no travel and a slow opening all commerce will suffer. We are talking a stagnant society until at least June 30. More retail, consumer goods, automobile companies are going to go bankrupt. We have an annual GDP in excess of $20T. This is grinding to a halt. FED/Govt/Treasury has thrown ~$5T at it already, but they will need to throw $2T a month at it to keep it all afloat.

As you can see in an effort to mitigate the damage of contango, they have rolled 20% of their contracts from June to July:  
 
NYMEX WTI JUN20  136,884 

ICE WTI  JUN20           21,064 

NYMEX WTI JUL20     28,609 

ICE WTI JUL20        5,000 

[source](http://www.uscfinvestments.com/holdings/uso) 
 
At current prices, [June/July/August](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/CLN20/futures-prices), USO is on track to lose 22% of their June contracts, and 7% of their July contracts in the next rollover May 5-8.  

If this holds up - it means that July/August prices would have to maintain $27 and $29 for the NAV and share price to stay above $3.69. (June/July are currently at $21 & $27)

The USO share price was trading at 7.8% above the NAV price today (that most certainly will not last).  USO was actually worth $3.46 as of the close of trading today.  

As you check current prices - you can see June is up to around $21.28 and July is up to around 27.12 giving USO a NAV of 3.59. 
However, since the July price increases are keeping pace with the June prices as they increase – that still leads to 22% loss of contracts. 

Obviously, prices change daily, but if the difference between June and July prices remains this high – contango will wipe out another large chunk of contracts. And $27 oil will get you the same USO price as $21 oil.  

That being said, if oil shoots up to $40 before then, I guess you'll be fine. 
 
 
FYI: the math is very basic 

(Contracts x 1000) x Oil price = market value. 

market value / shares = NAV price 

NAV price + premium discount = Share price

582,DD,Activision is going to smash $83 and hit new ATH in three weeks,102,g542sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g542sx/activision_is_going_to_smash_83_and_hit_new_ath/,75,1587454771.0,"I am going to share with you why ATVI is going to absolutely smash their ATH back in Q4 2018 of $83, in which the stock price lost almost half it's value by end of Q1 2019. The stock closed at $66 today, and Activision reports earnings 5/5.

Activision is in a much better position now than they were in Q4 2018 due to their ability to switch entirely to a high-margin, software driven sales model, reduce capital expenditure while increasing top line revenue, and significantly increase ARPU through seasonal DLC such as battle pass and cosmetic items. Activision was able to capitalize on this successfully as these did not provide a competitive advantage in COD multiplayer/Warzone and had high production value (weapon skins, character skins, calling cards, emblems, etc.)

——

**Record Levels of Player Engagement due to federal stay-at-home orders.** 

COD player count nearly doubled in just one month (mid March to April). This type of growth is unprecedented and since the stay at home orders were put in place, the player base has grown at faster rate since launch in October 2019. Warzone is free yes, but how many of those free customers do you think purchased a battle pass or cosmetic DLC? Not all yes, but surely a significant amount. Activision may likely see microtransaction revenue double assuming a doubling in the player base.

**Strong Cash Position and Continued Growth in Gaming**

Activision is well positioned to take on the coronavirus due to their strong cash position, which has been growing every fiscal quarter. Activision ended 2019 with a cash position of $5.8B. In fact, they will only benefit from this more as people continue to stay at home and continue gaming. Stocks like Netflix and Roku have seen major hype this past month, however the market seems to have forgotten about the gaming market, which I will dive into next.

**Crossplay capability greatly enhances player enjoyment due to increased social factor**

The console and PC gaming markets are two completely different consumer segments, resulting in friends being distanced from gaming due to two competing gaming platforms. By allowing console and PC players to play together, this would likely result in increased growth in sales due to players now being able to play with more friends. This would then result in an increase in play time as players tend stay online longer with friends than alone. All of this factors in to Activision's ""extrinsic value"" or customer loyalty and stickiness. Games are able to efficiently capture and capitalize on customer's emotions and Activision's marketing team is top notch in capturing the market's attention and keeping it for the long term.

**Strong Product Line-up**

I won't spend too much time on this one. World of Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo, Hearthstone, Call of Duty, etc. These are some of the biggest names in PC gaming in which Activision will retain their loyal customer base resulting in steady and consistent revenue in years to come.

Ultimately, the market has not caught on to this yet. Media has only been referring to big name stocks like Netflix, Roku, Grubhub, Wayfair, etc. in stay at home stocks but they are completely forgetting about the gaming world. ATVI, EA, and TTWO are well positioned to benefit from the worldwide crisis. 

ATVI call with any of the following strikes depending on your risk/reward ratio. These are on sale right now: $70, $75, $80 5/15",2020-04-21 03:39:31,0.9724,0.0,0.044632426303854875,0.3390108087679516

**Delta Airlines Thesis**

1. The company is currently at $23.79 and the markets have discounted the company based on pessimism and uncertainty of when things will revert back to normal
2. Unlike most U.S Airlines, Delta does not hedge fuel costs while most airlines are locked in at say fucking $67 dollars a barrel. Delta acquired a refinery in 2012 to produce jet fuel for its fleet (of which crude is an input so lower prices will lower cost)
3. Oil prices have just shit the bed, and Delta is in the perfect position to capitalize on extremely low oil prices for future profitability
4. I wager that in the earnings call conference, mgmt will have comments on how much they can potentially save
5. DAL benefitting from lower fuel prices will free up capital for future capex and fleet expansion  and investors will overlook low earnings (which has been ""priced in"")

**Disclaimer**: Not sure how airlines negotiate these future contracts especially in this fucked up macroeconomic environment but due to oversupply of oil from economic slowdown, prices should remain low.

**P.S.** Royal Caribbean, which also does not hedge fuel prices may move once markets react to DAL's release.

DAL 4/24 ~~$35C~~ to DAL 4/24 $32C

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**EDIT 2: A couple of caveats here after bouncing ideas off of multiple people:**

1. 4/24 $32C for $0.01 is cheap but there is reason to believe that the market has to an extent priced in earnings release so tread carefully with investing
2. My original thought was that the drop in oil price will increase profitability in the future which will drive up share price but I now think it's more of a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things
3. The fixed cost leveraging and unwinding of working capital is going to really force Delta to require government funding, and although it is an outstanding airline, government equity will dilute shareholders so the stock, has to an extent, priced that in.
4. That being said, markets are rather irrational right now given the unprecedented situation, so keep that in mind

I don't love DHT because they already contracted out a lot of their fleet for long-term storage, and at only moderately gouging prices. Need to learn more about TNK and FRO (though it looks like those entry points have become unattractive. Shame on me for missing them yesterday and this AM).

NAT (around $5) comes with a .14 dividend ex-5/22, which I'm going to consider a discount on the purchase price. If I were to hold it past May, that becomes a yield of 11-12% depending on entry point. NAT is announcing earnings on 5/18. This is expected to be the first quarter in a long time with solid earnings and cash flow, even though it's mostly before the massive tanker rental price increase. Analysts haven't touched their EPS estimates for the quarter, year, or 2021 yet ***at all***. Debt exists, but is manageable and being paid down, and free cash flow is increasing bigly. They could probably use some free cash to retire more debt and will definitely return some to shareholders.

What's amazing is this is mostly the situation **before** the oil glut and coronavirus pandemic! Tanker rental rates have skyrocketed, which is going to megacharge earnings and free cash flow, for at least the next few months (is two quarters too much to ask for?). Tankers sheltering in place reduces expenses slightly as well. With lending rates so low and strong assets to back up the business (\~1.3billion to about 400 mil in debt), I could definitely see new debt being issued to retire old debt at lower rates. I wouldn't be shocked to see an increase in dividend, as even in loss-making quarters NAT has shown an extreme dedication to returning value to investors through dividends.

There's going to be a lot of very, very good news coming for this company in the next month, both rearward- and forward-looking. They got their shit figured out just in time to take advantage of these incredible ~~generational~~ first time ever conditions (we've never seen oil in super contango like this, ever, in the history of oil). I easily see NAT trading up to their 8ish year highs in the mid-teens within the next few months. Yes, the hype might bring this stock into overweight territory and oil will eventually stabilize. That's the whole ""sell high"" part of the equation. It's tough to see a situation where I'm still holding this stock six or nine months from now, but it's gonna be a great ride into the summer, and I think the value of holding NAT outweighs playing it with options. I'm also gonna play some options on it too, because WTH.

Yeah, some of the first few NAT leases are trash, but the beauty is that they're short term. Some of the later contracts are straight $$$$$$$$. DHT is locked into $67,300/day for 12-18 friggin months. NAT, OTOH, says ""\[w\]e have concluded contracts of longer duration than above,"" above being 60 days, to capture price increases using shorter contracts. Since they were smart enough (smarter than DHT) to stop signing long-term contracts, hopefully they'll see when prices start to plateau and switch to signing long-term. This was in March. When oil prices still suck in mid-May (i.e. 60 days), DHT is going to be entering into new contracts. In March, even before oil got absolutely shitfucked to oblivion, they had deals on tanker time leases as high as $110,000/day.

Buy some in extended hours, bitches.  Or don't.  It's not like NAT needs you tards for a green eruption.

This has caused the share price to sky rocket >100% over the last week.

The rumor was posted on Bloomberg by Citigroup Inc. analyst Mohit Bansal. After doing some research on Mohit Bansal, it seems that he has made claims in the past that amounted to absolutely nothing. Furthermore, I called Katherine Bock (VP of Investor Relations at Arcus) today and she confirmed it was just a rumor.

Gilead recently dished out $4.9B last month to acquire Forty Seven and has not been doing too hot with its $12B acquisition of Kite. My guess is that with the current focus on Remdisivir and very recent acquisition history that even if these rumors are true it won't happen in the immediate future. And even if Gilead does take a stake, why would it be at double the market value of what Arcus was trading at last week??

Arcus is a thinly traded stock. Volume has dried up and was 1/4 today as the volume last Friday. I wouldn't touch options on this because the spreads are huge and the volume/OI is extremely low.

The rumors could be true and my position could get fucked - but im willing to bet on it all being a load of BS and see a near term decline in price on this low float stock. Here is my position:

I'll make this short and throw in pictures for the illiterate.

Just kidding. Fuck you, read my shit.

The reason oil prices go negative is because it's apparently more costly to stop and restart oil production than it would be to literally pay people to take the oil off your hands. Of course, this doesn't happen until storage facilities reach maximum capacity. [u/krypticlol](https://www.reddit.com/user/krypticlol/) was pretty early with his prediction of when even federal reserve capacity would reached (they estimated end of March).

>Drillers and pumpers already know this – so they’ve been chartering oil tankers out for months at a time. You can quote me on this: giant floating tanks of oil, typically used for transporting oil across oceans, will instead be repurposed to act as storage facilities during this oversupply event. This is not the first time these boats were used for this reason, same thing was done in 2015-2016. For those who want to know the mechanics, daily spot rates to reserve one of these VLCCs has risen from an average of $30,000/day to over $250,000/day. Keep in mind, boat expenses will not vary much, crew, food is all fixed – so nearly every additional dollar at the topline can flow to the bottom. We are talking about a potential for 3-5x in net income for some of these names.

Well that's great u/ozemoed, but where are your news sources supporting this prediction?

Article from Nature (scientific journal).

This article looks at whos making vaccines for COVID. All you need to know is that there are 115 candidates, and only 5 of those have actually made it into clinic so far. However, ALL of these vaccines are all from technology that has NEVER been used before in vaccines. Moderna ($MRNA) and Inovio ($INO) are both genetic material based. You may be asking, what the heck does that mean for making $$$$$? Well, this means that what we're attempting has NEVER been done before, and the margin for error is really high. Aka, the timeline that we'll have a vaccine by early next year is all banging on the fact that these risky vaccines will work.

Not only that, but bc these are new types of vaccines, no one has the manufacturing capabilities to actually churn out a ton of these for all you autists. Bill Gates is already working on building factories to make the vaccines, but even that won't be enough to cover all our population (prob will be given to health and essential workers first). Currently, INO's manufacturing capabilities would let them make 1 million vaccines a year. That's like, nothing. MRNA has also gotten a $400M grant from the government. This sounds like a lot of money, but clinical trials are really expensive to run. This should cover their clinical trial costs, but not much after that.

To give you something to compare to, the average timeline to make a vaccine is 10 years (Ebola was fastest in 5 years), and typically the failure rate is 90%. So everyone hoping that we'll have a cure for this by next year is really optimistic.

MRNA started trials on healthy normal young 20 year olds should end in June, and they'll report positive data saying no one died from their vaccine. Duh. The stock will still go up. Buy calls before June 1st, sell. The next round of clinical trials actually test if it works against COVID, and there's a hot chance it won't. Buy puts after June 1st. The price action on MRNA is banking on the fact that their vaccine works, but there's a much higher chance it won't. *Also, the FDA has notoriously high standards for vaccines (different from drugs) bc a vaccine is given to healthy people, so any type of side effects are a no-go.* 

To hedge this put in case MRNA's vaccine is efficacious, buy puts on INO at the same time.

INO's trials on rly healthy people doesn't end till in Nov, so I feel like they might tank when MRNA announces that their trial went well. Buy puts on INO, or just short the stock directly it's cheap so even you autists can afford it.

Once we start seeing headlines saying that MRNA or INO's vaccine failed in phase 2 clinical trials those stocks will tank, and so will everyone's hopes and dreams. Also, this is a motherfucking rat race, in that even if one of their vaccines is actually good, they have to be the first one to be approved to get credit for it. If someone has a vaccine and gets data and FDA approval a week before you, bye bye you done. Flush your stock down the toilet. If you buy long-term puts on a bunch of the companies trying to make a vaccine, if one of them actually works (better chance of seeing God but still), then you can still bank on all the other stocks TANKING on positive data from the other vaccine and you should still end up net positive. MRNA stock is up over 100% bc of corona, and INO used to trade at 4 before this.

tldr; can't bank on a vaccine to save us, market has priced in a vaccine being available by next year which is the best case scenario. Buy puts on MRNA and INO. Best case scenario, both will go donw, and worst case, one will tank while the other will skyrocket.  **MRNA 20p 1/21**, **INO 4p 1/21**",2020-04-21 00:39:19,1.0,0.34,-0.12721428571428572,0.40426190476190477

So, let's start from the top, the valuation. Roughly 20B in market cap, trading 11X trailing Revenue (1.7B FYE19). For the uninitiated that's a lot. Now that's not ALWAYS a bad thing, if you're working on the cure for cancer that you can sell for ten dollars of Cost of Goods Sold, yeah I'm going to invest in your company at 11X earnings.

Here's the prob:

[https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/16/saupload\_52891963f6f0e51423b16ee80b7d51d6.png](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/16/saupload_52891963f6f0e51423b16ee80b7d51d6.png)

They are WAY overpriced by this metric compared to Peers, and it isn't even warranted. They have rising competition in form of TikTok (notably PINS, TWTR etc.. do not have established rivals in their space)  They have significantly worse margins than their Peers as well. (The SA article where the pic comes from does a good job going into detail).

SNAP has been losing money for a long time, in fact since ever. They have never been profitable. So why are they worth 11X trailing revenue? **Revenue GROWTH**. Their share price growth has been fueled by consistent revenue growth every Q (and the two Qs that put into question revenue growth KILLED share price). Keep in mind, despite all of this growth, they are nowhere near being a true EPS entity, they need to kill it for a LONG time to get to revenue high enough to generate earnings.

Q2 guidance will be a poison pill for SNAP because of how fucking bad it will be. Why is that?

**The underlying nature of their advertising contracts. (which make up all of their revenue)**

If you decide to peruse their 2019 10-K, Snap actually does a great job disclosing the nature of their customer ad contracts. Snapchat virtually only engages in short term deals to sell ad space. It makes sense, customers aren't comfortable making long term commitments to a platform like SNAP, they are fresh to the scene. They usually run ""promos"" where they sell heavily discounted ad space to get people in the door. They actually take careful note (probably because their auditors are assholes) that advertising revenue can be extremely volatile and that clients are generally quick to pull business from new players like Snap since the value isn't quite clear yet.

Snapchat of course knows this. They are scared shitless and have been trying to frame the narrative:

[https://seekingalpha.com/news/3557548-snapchat-touts-engagement-boosts-in-march](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3557548-snapchat-touts-engagement-boosts-in-march)

This sentiment has brought SNAP's share price from $10 at the bottom a month ago to $13 where it sits today. ($19 pre beerflu). More engagement = more revenue right? SNAP knows all eyes are going to be on their guidance. They know ADUs will be mostly flat and projected ARPU will be a disaster since most their growth is being generated on that front.

**The Best fucking part.**

I think what really binds a lot of bearish DD here is the that we're all dealing with shit that has already tanked in one way or another, we're all looking to piss on the grave of some company that's on it's way out. You may be thinking that since the drop from 19 --> 13 that's exactly what we're doing here. We're not. Check the 1 Year. This piece of shit was at 5 fucking dollars a share after everyone was sick of it's unprofitable shit in Jan 2019. It's been a TEAR since because of what again?

Revenue growth. Join in for the earnings call on Tuesday to discover exactly how much revenue growth they think they have in store for Q2. The only reason I even thought of this play is because a hedge fund just took a massive short position recently on a rumour that 90% of their revenue essentially evaporated overnight. You don't need to buy that rumour but you should understand that SNAP has HUGE headwinds in their revenue growth story up ahead, and that's horrible news to a PRE-EPS company like them.

I'll update with what the DPI activity was once it gets posted for Monday, if I had to guess Gamma Exposure and DIX tanked today.

So my prediction was correct and FLIR went up bigly today, even more than I had expected.

&nbsp;

I was sitting on 17 5/15 $40 calls that I sold for 200% profit. If I had held I would have made an extra 160%! Instead, I panic sold and then immediately rolled over to 7/17 $55 calls. 

&nbsp;

I'll summarize my DD for you retards with attention spans shorter than Donnie's micro-penis. So don't fucking debate me and go ""Buh-buh FLIR is too expensive, It wasn't made for human temperature monitoring wahhhhh"" until you actually understand my reasoning:

&nbsp;

* THIS DOES NOT DETECT CORONAVIRUS and a lot of people are actually asymptomatic meaning no fever
* Instead, thermal imaging is a first line of defense that can allow companies to easily and rapidly monitor for elevated body temperature from a safe distance.
* Business, governments, and people want to get the fuck back to work and this is a tool that can add some sense of security, even if false. It's part of a broader solution to get us back to some sense of normalcy.
* Even if this expensive, $11k is literally nothing for big businesses that stand to lose more than 10x that every day they aren't operating
* No, your cheap Chinese crap, with spyware and gimped specs for Americans, will not be fucking contracted by LAX and JFK. Look how well relying on china to provide our PPE and essential equipment turned out for us and Europe last month
* I can see it being part of national security to not have our vital industries rely on Chinese shit. So Raytheon, Lockheed, and Boeing will legally not be allowed to have chinese or foreign thermal imaging equipment in their facilities. On top of public infrastructure like airports.
* Lastly, other thermal imaging companies rely on sensors from FLIR and Lynred (which is shut down btw). SO even if they aren't buying FLIR cameras, they are still benefitting from the sensor sales.

I'll be honest. The largest gain-train had left the station at 3:59 PM last Friday. Too bad for those of you who didn't read my DD. There are still some gains to be made but not anywhere near 360%, sorry.

You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

The world of investing can be a jungle. Gay Bulls, Gay Bears, danger at every turn. That's why we at WallStreetBets pride ourselves at being the best-trained professionals to guide you through the financial wilderness. WallStreetBets, stability, integrity, pride. Now for the real shit.

&#x200B;

**DIS**; I know I go on and on about how we should play the mouse. Disney (DIS) is just such a fucking beast to mess with that it seems you get cock slapped no matter if they go up or down. I don't take any of that back but I am comfortable in saying that they may be a good play in the coming week.[ This post gets into that](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4t8ng/betting_on_the_mouse/) very well. Basically, in the stock market, a share can go up in value even if the company it represents does not have any good news. This is evident in the ENTIRE medical industry rising in value because everyone thinks that coronavirus=money for medical. Some medical companies are going to go under but that doesn't matter to investors because medical is a necessity right now so the price goes up. This happens in every industry. When amazon goes up, other online shopping stocks go up. When Netflix (NFLX) goes up on Wednesday after a good quarter the rest of the streaming industry will probably go up too. Bringing me to my point. Disney owns HULU, Disney+, Star Wars, Marvel, FOX, and a bunch of other shit. These assets are a large part of the streaming industry as a whole. Disney will get a boost in price just because of Netflix. Like what was said in the original post that I linked, DIS 110c and above is a good choice. Just don't be a fucking idiot and bet your whole account on it, or do I don't give a shit.

&#x200B;

**SHOP**; Now, this is a play that scares the shit out of me. As much as I'd like to say I know exactly what is going to happen I sure as hell don't. Shopify (SHOP) is at all-time highs and not by a little either. By almost $100 a share. With demand skyrocketing and there not seeming to be a slow down anytime soon, they could keep going up for a while. However, all-time highs lead to a drop eventually. They release earnings on 5/6 before open. My bet is that they are going to go up and up until earnings then they will drop that day and it won't matter if earnings were good or not. With a rise of this sheer magnitude, this outcome is just what is most likely to happen. Read[ this post about why](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4fbd8/amznshop_the_fundamental_shift_towards_ecommerce/) they are doing great and how it relates to everything but take what I say into consideration. I'm not saying they are gonna drop to $50 a share. Just that they are going to drop after earnings on 5/6 and to play it accordingly. They could keep going up though and that wouldn't be good for us. That's why this play is scary. A company rising this much in value this quickly looks exactly like a pump and dumb by the market makers. Who knows? Maybe people really think that SHOP is the next amazon.

&#x200B;

**Bear Porn**; Here on WSB, we all tend to love a good confirmation bias. It makes our dicks hard, tells us exactly what we want to hear, and lets us continue to be stuck in our ways of maximizing losses like a good little retard. Well for those of you that need a good reason to hold your puts until your hands turn blue (don't diamond hands me you know you're just a dipshit), here you go.[ This post gives you more reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4erh0/a_comprehensive_analysis_of_the_continued_bear/) to keep your puts than you could ever hope to read. The post is the Mayan Calendar of apocalypse predictions and will keep you from saying, “You know what? Maybe I shouldn't hold these puts that have wiped 98% of my account.” Because we all know that getting rid of something that is making you LOSE MONEY is a bad idea. Whatever. I beat my dick raw looking at your loss porn so keep it coming.

&#x200B;

Finally, my man [u/howardedwin](https://www.reddit.com/u/howardedwin/) said that the peak of the DOW would be exactly 24,281.16. It hit 24,233.85 before dropping at open today. It sits down about 300 points from the high on Friday as of this writing. If this is the beginning of the drop he was so fucking close to calling it. However, his wager still stands at this point.[ A ban if he is off by more than one point](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fy5b8t/a_prophet_arrives/). I hope for his sake that we are green tomorrow.

TLDR; Disney go up because of Netflix, Shopify go up because people buy mucho things online, keep flogging those flaccid dicks bears I believe in you.

In my opinion, making bets like this is a total gamble, and these companies will fluctuate with news of trials that may or may not be true. **Buying calls on pharmaceutical companies is like trying to bet on a mining company during the gold rush; a total chance on who will strike gold and get rich.**

I propose an alternate play here. The companies that sell the equipment and supplies that make it possible for these companies to continue to do research and development. **Regardless of who comes up with a solution, there are a few companies making an absolute killing while all of this goes on. These are the shovel sellers.**

I'm going to share a couple of my plays, and I'd encourage others to share their thoughts or any other plays that fit into this category.

&#x200B;

**Play #1: Veeva Systems (VEEV)**

Veeva Systems creates software that is specifically tailored to the life sciences and pharmaceuticals industry. Their platform is used to manage clinical trials, have virtual meetings, manage customers and data, and more.

&#x200B;

Certain aspects of their platform such as Veeva Engage, a tool built on top of Zoom for meeting with Healthcare professionals, have seen insane growth in usage.[https://www.pulsedigital.co.uk/blog/post/covid-19-pandemic-leads-to-a-tenfold-increase-in-usage-of-veeva-engage](https://www.pulsedigital.co.uk/blog/post/covid-19-pandemic-leads-to-a-tenfold-increase-in-usage-of-veeva-engage)

The reason I like Veeva so much is that because they are in such a compliant industry, many parts of their platform have basically no competition. A great example of this is with their CRM. It can cost millions of dollars to buy a CRM system (i.e. Salesforce, Dynamics, Zoho, Hubspot, etc.) and customize it to your business. Veeva licensed Salesforce and customized it to the needs of an entire industry over a decade, to the point that it would almost impossible for their customers to build their own systems, or for another software company to make something that's up to par. They also have tons of cash and no debt, which is a major bonus.

Position: I've been holding 5/15 $190 calls for a couple weeks (already printing), and I plan to buy a few higher OTM calls  with strikes later this year. This is an extremely safe position (the stock not the FD) whether you're bullish or bearish on the market overall, so I expect more people to pile into Veeva.

**Play #2 - Thermo-Fisher Scientific (TMO)**

Thermo Fisher is a manufacturer and distributor of laboratory equipment and supplies.

Thermo Fisher supplies all of the tools necessary for laboratories to keep up production. This includes everything from test tubes and vials, to masks and PPE, to the heavy equipment used to test samples. They're even developing their own COVID-19 tests:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-receives-ce-060000782.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-receives-ce-060000782.html)

I like Thermo because they stand to make a killing even after a vaccine is found, because they sell equipment used in the manufacture of tests and vaccines that will be in high demand as production ramps up, regardless of who discovers the best method.

Positions: I have 6/19 $350 calls. I'm planning to buy more long-dated calls (probably Jan '22) that will cover through the manufacturing period.

**TL:DR** There are a few companies that supply the pharmaceutical industry. I've found that betting on these is a hell of a lot safer than betting on individual companies to develop a test or vaccine.

&#x200B;

Edit: I love that the first thing you guys did was buy the most screeching autistic, closest date, highest strike call available.

Even with record inflows approaching $1.8 Billion dollars at the end of March, A savvy investor (or autist) should spend their money elsewhere. USO is designed for short term investors who constantly monitor sweet crude to swing trade. The fund holds short-term futures on WTI crude (NYMEX).

Right now the fund is experiencing contango because the current oil futures are priced lower than future months, meaning profits are eaten away for long term investors. As West Texas Intermediate crude futures fall 50% and oil volatility explodes more than 200%, I strongly recommend to anyone looking for a good place to park money for the long term to avoid USO.

If you happen to be a trader with a substantial physical oil repository, you could place spreads betting on contago increasing and generate a healthy return. An individual controlling physical oil with storage can sell futures contracts for delivery at say $65, and then sit on the physical oil for a couple month to realize healthy gains.

Alternatively, you could short a closer spot month's contract and buy a further out months securing profit if the market increases its contago structure (praying there isn't any backwardation). Unfortunately for this hypothetical individual, oil and other commodities are subject to this because short-term supply scares tend to drive UP the spot month price. With the fights between the Middle East and Russia heating up combined with existing political instability, personally I'd avoid the subject in its entirety.

You can very easily lose money even if oil goes past $40. Usually the roll premium for oil futures (what these etf's need to use) is around 20 cents, however it is near 6 dollars right now. If this continues even for a few months and you get into oil at $10 per barrel, you can easily end up losing money even when the price inevitably rises up again.

If I am analyzing this correctly. Would the drop in oil prices may help mitigate the loss that Airlines are taking. Additionally cruise lines?

If it’s cheaper for transportation, large companies who rely on oil (such as cruise lines and airlines) should be able to mitigate some of the affects of decreased demands.

TLDR, Cheaper oil, means lowers costs to operate engines, which means smaller losses.
 Which in turns means that cruise lines and airlines might have a small run up this week.

People home bored out of their minds equals lots more people spending hours watching Netflix

Now, just because their stock is doing good and we know people are watching Netflix, we do not know how many people went out and bought a subscription. Many people already had one. It seems obvious that earnings will be good but, I can't shake the feeling that it's ""almost too good to be true""

Buying calls/puts the day before earnings is released is fucking stupid due to high ass I.V. which plummets as soon as the report comes out. This is why spreads are the way.

I think Netflix will have good earnings and go up, hence why I think a put credit spread is a good idea.

What's this mean?

If vix is at an equivalent value as it was when spy was lower from a couple weeks ago, that means puts are rising, and since volume is shrinking on the spy uptrend over the past weekish, then that only means institutions and MMs are loading the FUCK up right now and I am more confident than ever on a true leg down very soon.

You see Netflix does not make money when you stay at home and watch their movies (paradoxical I know, but true) - they make money from monthly subscriptions. You sitting on your ass all day and using their bandwidth is what is actually costing them money. And for the economically  savvy of you out there, you will notice that costing is the opposite of earning.

In other words, the best circumstances for Netflix to make money would be to have you subscribed to their service and never use it, or use it sparingly. Do you honestly think that $10 is going to  pay for TBs worth of bandwidth increases per month?

Obligatory: Not financial advice yada yada

For those of you following the oil market, you probably saw the headlines that oil is now to its lowest point since 19xx... $11-12 bottom line: crazy, but doesn't matter. What you saw is the tail end of Crude Oil May WTI contracts trading just before its close (tomorrow). This price is shockingly low, but the majority of the traders have already moved on to June contracts. Focus on the June contract (also shocking how much it moved and much more important right now) instead of the nearly dead May one. Let's begin... 

Background:
Why are oil prices so low? Saudi Arabia and Russia and OPEC+ created a massive increase in supply after failed negotiations (This is itself an aftershock to a coordinated oversupply of the market in 2016 to fight US shale). This excess supply timed with a drop in demand as the world shut down due to corona virus. The result has meant that the market is flooded with oil and is looking for any place they can to store it. This storage crunch has even resulted in some bizarre cases of negative pricing (Canada in some places). This has all been especially damaging to US shale due to the high cost of extraction, the high levels of debt these companies have, and the slow reaction of the US to secure cuts to global or domestic output and a failure to provide relief money to this industry. 

Development looking forward:
Prices will stabilize when we have a good idea of when and how much demand there will be in the near-term, mid-term, and long-term. I say this in this way since we still do not know how US industry will reopen. Lots of plans are floating around, but what happens when we have a spike in cases in a few months? Boom, back to a shutdown, and guidance is once again thrown out the window. What is really great about looking month by month at oil contracts, is we can see the expected curve of economic recovery/ industrial demand, as the industry currently sees it [7]. What we can also see is today's movement is the dragging down further out contract prices as the nearterm (May / June) prices collapse. As we gain more information about how and when the economy will open, we can expect the price of oil to change accordingly.     

What do I see:
There is still a ton of room left for oil to come down, but, stop looking at May and look forward. For ETFs like USO, which don't want the physical commodity showing up at their door, must ""roll forward"" their near-to-expiry contracts (cheap), into further out contracts (expensive). Today, as it stands, the near-term contracts (May/June) are massively cheaper than further out contracts. This means, as USO continues to roll its June contracts (22.59) out, they have to pay ~20%+ premium to secure contracts (July: 27.77). ***They are selling low and buying high due to the state of contango. As long as these market conditions persist, they won't begin to climb and will instead keep sinking.*** The oil futures are still pricing in a rather sharp recovery, but the more that gets nudged out, the worse for USO. If we keep saying ""V Shaped recovery, right around the corner"" then (as long as investors have faith in that plan) the commodity prices keep reflecting a V-up. As you approach expiration, and you kick the re-opening can down the road, near-expiry contracts sink (no one wants to pay to store the oil) and you keep contango going. As a result, USO continues downward. Even when this situation undwinds, USO will simply not return to previous highs due to the way it is structured. 

What am I afraid of:
Retail investors have flooded USO with money in hopes of a sharp rebound. We know that retail investors are piling on, since the number of individuals has skyrocketed [1][2]. If real ***professional*** traders were the ones adding money, placing long bets, we would not have seen such an exponential increase in the number of accounts with holdings. This tells me the following: As contango continues, and USO drops / fails to grow over the next months, retail money will FOMO / margin call out. This outflow of money could have a drastic impact on the stability of the ETF, and, in turn, the overall US oil market. ***USO currently controls over 25% of all outstanding WTI contracts***. If the recent inflows to USO reverses, with a continued supply glut and decreased demand, we could see a destabilization of the ETF and broader market. If USO needs to quickly sell a massive number of contacts due to fund outflows and rebalancing, then the fund is at risk of a death spiral -> Sell contracts to the market, drop in price due to low demand and high supply -> further losses -> further outflows -> and on and on. This is not a likely situation, this can only happen if there is a massive + sustained + quick drop, followed by a massive and quick pull of funds from the ETF. However, the speed with which the ETF has grown has me worried for the way retail investors will react when their quick 200% sure-thing oil play becomes a -50% loss over the course of a month (or a week).

TLDR: USO, where to Go? 
Scared Money: Stay the fuck away from this.
Smart Money: Call Credit Spreads. Take advantage of all the money which has poured into the fund, and which will continue to do so in the short term. They are waiting for a quick rebound once the economy reopens. The ETF is not structured for this, and will continue to suffer forward rolling loses. Collect your drip drip drip of oil premium and chill. Keep an eye on government intervention, be ready to exit early on bailouts.

EDIT 1: It's funny how much a day can change a post. First, WTI went negative for the May contracts. Lots of speculation as to what caused it (storage surprise, a firm collapsing and being margin called?) but ultimately, the volume traded today on the May pales in comparision to June. We saw the June contracts close out at 21.19, dropping 3.84 on the day. This means, with July at 27.46 at the moment, and assumign the gap between the two holds, there is a ~23% premium to roll forward June contracts into July. With this extreme amount of contango, I believe even stronger the USO will struggle to meet its fund objective, and they may resort to further changing the % make-up of the contracts they're holding, or other methods to ensure they don't pop.

EDIT 2: I like this post and am going to gather my thoughts here: I am looking to close out out a few positions today, even though they are longer term. The first is USO. #1 - I hit my return target on a put debit spread that I opened yesterday. I think much stronger today, seeing how far the June contracts have dropped, that a government intervention is on the way. This could be the one that people ""remember"" from this crisis, as it would be unholy unpopular if it involved bailout money for any oil producers. #2 - I think we are not far off from USO delisting. This fund just isn't functioning in this environment. On Monday, the flow of money into the ETF continued to tune of 500$ mil in money pouring in. This morning, down 20 or so %, I think a lot of people are going to be shell shocked and flows might turn. But who knows! How long until June goes negative?

EDIT 3: And there's the Tweet https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252591306028785667 ...of course. Whether this means anything or not, who knows. But not, you have an oil ETF which is massively disconnected from the price of oil, trading way above NAV, with massive forward rolling losses in its future, with higher volitility making options plays more difficult.

There you go... Leave an upvote and comment thanking me for my service or read the post that I spent an hour or more making fun and exciting, unlike your love life. ***Also, a slightly more in depth TL;DR is at the bottom.***

Anyways... Recently, you may have heard that the ever slippery Stevey Mnuch and Friends want to inject an additional 370 billion to the small business loan program. You may have sat at your computer typing on those keys that have had an odd crusty white substance stuck them since March 23rd. You may be quivering in your Fruit of the Loom tighty whites *(Not a recommendation to buy $HBI)* while you scream:

*""Oh no... My 80 4/24 IWM Put won't print now!""*

**First off**, if you're that stupid and have that position please give me evidence so I can give you some gold awards. **Secondly, this stimulus bill will be about as useful as you in the bedroom when your wife's boyfriend is over.** Allow me to explain.


--------
**Reason One:** *You'll Never Be Enough.*

It's simply not enough money. In the [original bullshit](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-anatomy-of-the-2-trillion-covid-19-stimulus-bill/) Papa Pump Trump slid into the economy's backdoor it contained $377 Billion for Small Businesses. *-349 of which was paycheck protection, this will be important later-* Now as you read I want you to keep in mind that I'm not talking about the hog local florist from whom you buy your wife flowers in hopes that he legs will bloom open for you.

**Remember, she is traded around by the Chads in your hometown, not the NYSE.** 

Only a small portion (17B) of this money was set aside for existing loan relief and an even smaller portion (10B) in grants. **Which is important why?**

Many of these small-mid cap companies that IWM tracks **already have** existing loans and outlying credit. If you don't know how to read a balance sheet I highly reccomend enrolling in your local community college. Not only will you learn about finance from a rapidly deteriorating old man, but maybe the weird goth girl might get hot and heavy with you when she sees that **bloody** looking robinhood portfolio of yours. 

Now look, I'm not talking about Boeing ($BA) level debt where selling your firstborn to help with the debt is a requirement for each employee upon hiring, but the average small business had $195,000 in debt [as of 2016](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/smallbusiness/2017/05/15/5-steps-digging-out-business-debt/101424796/) so you can use some mental math to leg that up to your mid caps. 

So... If that preemptive 377 billion disappeared in right around two weeks, *-Arguably faster as we weren't alerted to this until the website told us so-* explain to me how the tits 370 billion will help when we have even more needy companies? 

*""Just like my art degree... It won't help!""*

That's right little Autist! ***It won't***.

--------
**Reason Two:** *Snipped Like a Married Man in His Forties.*

The loan is getting chopped up and tossed around like your dog Rufus in a Wuhan Wet Market. To quote the devil named CNBC ""Democrats and Republicans were negotiating a deal that would allocate $310 billion more into the Paycheck Protection Program, set aside $60 billion of that sum for rural and minority groups. Another $60 billion would go to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program."" 

**So there is your first few cuts.** 

Not only would they be once again screwing companies by only allowing them to allocate money to paychecks, but now we're getting PC and making sure Cotton Eye Joe and Minorities get their fair share. Please keep in mind this portion is discussing the 310 billion portion for paycheck protection... Just imagine the Xtra small condoms you use, but for paychecks. 


Let's do some Mad Money Math in honor of Cramer:
370-310= 60 Billion for actual Business Expenses. 
310-60-60=*69* + 121-60 = **130 Billion** For people who don't find pleasure *erotically* touching cows and non-minorities. We're also subtracting that 3rd 60 million because it's just a specialized loan for the really small companies. (Irrelevant and I'll subtract in the end)


So, now that we've figured out that we've got 130 billion for all buisne-**""Earlier in the day, Mnuchin said the deal could include $75 billion in funding for hospitals and $25 billion in funding for testing.""** Okay, shit. 130-100=**30 Billion** open for regular businesses. We also [already have](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/17/jpmorgan-says-it-has-26-billion-in-small-business-applications-left.html) 26 billion dollars worth of loans just waiting to be filled at JPM alone. 

Don't get too hard yet because as the late Billy Mays used to say *""But wait! There is more!""*


Alright, so maybe they're going to tack that onto the bill and just make it 470, right? Right? Probably not. Based on consensus explained by Ronald McDonald... *Looks at notes written in crayon* I mean Mitch McConnell, the current state of the bill is pretty much accepted by both parties. This means these cuts are once again coming from inside the fund and are just being reallocated and limited once again. Right now they're just arguing about whether of not they should short $SNAP, err, I mean ensure those small businesses without bank relationships get those SNAP benefits. 

They're like you... **Having Relations = Bad. Watching Your Wife Have Relations = Good**


--------
**Reason Three:** *IWM Built Its Foundation in the Sand*


The makeup of IWM is nothing like SPY and contains businesses with **huge** weaknesses. [SPY](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/spy-spdr-sp-500-trust-etf.asp) has large holding in the the markets daddies like GOOGL, AMZN, BERK.B, MSFT, AAPL, etc. These companies are nothing but resilient. Hell, it took Apple a [month](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/) to produce a cheap Corona phone. These guys are at the top of their game, meanwhile [IWM](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239710/ishares-russell-2000-etf) contains huge amounts of Real Estate, Financials, Industrials, and most importantly... Healthcare.


*""bUT i_nOT HEalThCArE cAn OnLY gO UpSieS""* 


Listen here you idiots, I'm going to give you a little background on myself :) I wear many panties, but one of my biggest and most comfortable pairs is the management and QC of a number pharmaceutical warehouses. I can anecdotally tell you that pharmaceuticals are going in and out faster than the speed of light. Kind of like how you'll forget everything you just read in two hours, so don't forget to reread this seven times... I think that is a psychological fact? So yes, things are moving fast and healthcare is sort of working but here is the most important thing, we're not really getting shipments from outside the US. The ""legal drug trade"" inside the US is shipping at an all time high right now, but we're only passing around **what we already have**. Outside drugs are coming in at a steady rate but they're being used up so quickly by the big boys little pharma has no chance. Why is that important? Well, that means little pharma has no opportunity to get their gloves on the supplies/drugs needed for testing and 'cures'. *Checks notes* Ah, guess I should help you remember that relatively small healthcare companies make up 22% of IWM's positions and all of that 100 billion is going into **testing** and **hospitals**. Also, the next biggest position is in Financials... Do I really need to explain why that is awesome for your puts? 


-------- 

TL;DR
The Wrap Up: *What your wife's boyfriend doesn't do.*


So here is what we just discussed in a nutshell. The Fed is giving **370 billion to 'small businesses'.** ***310 billion*** of that goes to paycheck assurance. **120 million of that 310 is reserved for minorities** and farmers. **60 Billion is reserved for tiny companies** and pyramid schemes on Instagram. Another **25 billion of that is for testing** and **75 billion more is for hospitals**. So... All in all actual small-mid cap businesses who need money have little to no chance to get it. The balance sheets of these companies won't improve anytime soon and the disruption will last for many more months. IWM's makeup is nothing like SPY, and it features companies that will fail. IWM will fall, it was relatively resilient during the initial fall and it will see new lows. Albeit, I'm just some dummy on Reddit who makes occasional DD and Memes. 

Love,

**My Thoughts on the Bill Passing and the amount being increased:**

It means nothing. As I predicted in Reason 2, even with the 'additional' 100 Billion added, there are still too many mouths to feed. This is explicitly seen by the lack of a rally upon this bill passing. The market knows this isn't enough. I expect an overnight rally after people have time to look over this bill. We'll drop back down soon as the optimism will quickly lose steam. Also, keep in mind the bill won't officially pass until Thursday's vote **but** this announcement should've started a rally... Instead we actually got a few higher volume sells. ***Hold steady, our timeline may be moved up or pushed back on Thursday so adjust accordingly.*** 

Edit: As predicted, our timeline has been moved.


***Useless Edits-***

Edit: CNBC just reported that the deal 'will pass' on Tuesday (4/21/20) this was followed promptly by multiple red candles on IWM. Not rock hard evidence because it's low-volume premarket, but this could be very telling.

Edit 1:36PM: We've had a few nice dumps today, but we've been relatively neutral since open. I would be careful about entering positions today as we'll **probably** see a late rally if the bill passes or just a rally out of optimism. Additionally, the price **may** dump if the bill passes without certain adjustments or if no decision is made.

Edit 3:30PM- The [bill](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/ED475E42-8315-11EA-BD88-03BB51EFA6E1) has passed. The updated bill is now **460** Billion! It looks like they did what I mentioned in Reason 2.

Like most struggling 🌈🐱🐻🐷, I've been rolling my puts further out, while learning how to better time the market using crayons and a Magic 8-Ball. Since there may only be a week or two more upside, it's possibly now the dumbest time to switch to calls, so of course I'm gonna give it a try.

Looking at earnings this week, and trying to understand how the quants have been tuning their algos to hurt so good, I've come to speculate on DIS, particularly in its response to what may be very positive NFLX earnings after market on Tuesday, and the subsequent additional interest it may generate for streaming platforms as safe havens during the pandemic bear market.

**Shower Thoughts**

1. ""Buy the rumor"": ✅ NFLX has mooned to ATHs, as the beloved streaming giant is a gg-ez stay-at-home play.
2. ""Sell the news"": ☑️ NFLX earnings may beat expectations on Tuesday, but it could go up or down, having already mooned by up to 78% since it's September lows.
3. ""Buy the rumor"": ☑️ If NFLX DOES beat expectations, or at least has a very positive Q1 and forward-looking statement, it could reinforce the ""rumor"" that ALL streaming services are going to the moon. Enter the Mouse, DIS, who owns HULU, Disney+, and a treasure trove of potential streaming IPs, like Star Wars, Marvel, FOX, and duh - Disney. If the algos are tuned to give any love to DIS on this news, let alone the Boomers, we could see it take off this week. 🚀

**In the News**

If you've been fighting the Mouse since late March, you're plenty familiar with how resilient this rascally rodent has been to bad news. Despite all the losses in parks revenue, it's bounced 30%+ since March lows, as Boomers have rallied behind their cheerleader big Don, and look to the Mouse to weather the storm in the hearts and minds of their kids and grandkids' kids. To that end, DIS picked up a new [$5B credit agreement](https://www.forbes.com./sites/jeffewing/2020/04/14/disney-seeking-to-weather-economic-storm-with-new-5-billion-credit-agreement/#581d49db7a3d) from Citibank last week.

Disney+ already has over [50M paid subscribers](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/04/08/business/disney-plus-50-million-subscribers.html) in just 5 months, compared to Netflix's 167M built up over the past 13 years.

We saw last Thursday with GILD, how news on a single company can have [wide-reaching impact on the market](https://www.barrons.com./articles/the-dow-gilead-stock-coronavirus-covid-19-51587125308?mod=md_home_pan_mkt_news). LYV was up 22% AH on FAKE news of a cure and I about lost my mind staring at my puts being murdered. It seems plausible that positive REAL news about the impact of coronavirus on the leading streaming service could raise the tide for all of them.

Bonus [bullish news](https://thehill.com./policy/finance/493578-disney-to-stop-paying-100k-employees-as-cost-saving-measure-report) broke this weekend that cosmic brain DIS is saving $500M a month by not paying 100,000 employees. Ebenezer bull-gang confirmed.

DIS is down today following the market's oil slide and a UBS downgrade, so calls are on sale. If I'm wrong about this, the worst case for me is all of my puts print; I just don't want to risk another week playing only one side.

**TL;DR**

* SPY 205p 10/16

No BS or Filler, just knowledge as too many are giving out bad knowledge on the gas industry from my 25 year old perspective. Read this through for my thoughts or just review the bullet points as they're useful. 

Gas traders have physical Gas pricing of off a daily publisher of prices inside storage tanks which are often a 1 year or beyond lease. You can have monthly average price or Spot price which is the daily fixed price people will pay. 

Commodity traders should NOT make a deal without a firm margin as they are subject to variable costs such as Demurrage/ Additive&Inhibitor /etc as well as have to buy hedges. 

 * Demurrage = Basically ship has nowhere to unload cargo or waiting in line to unload. As it sits idle the owner of the commodity (trader) pays stupid amounts of money. Or or they get paid to become floating storage which is self explanatory. 

 * Additive/Inhibitor = Extra crucial now as in a short trip/not sitting the chemicals rarely denatured, but now they sit as the world gets warmer so I expect many cargoes go bad. My trader had a cargo go bad and ended up blending it with other gas for 6 months (is that illegal?) which I have to imagine is normal. More refined petrochemicals like butadiene need these more. 

 * Hedge = RBOB & RVR/RVG which RBOB is gas futures idk its easy, but the RVR/RVG is used to hedge the spread between NY Harbor and US Gulf prices as there is arbitrage albeit not useful as its too known. This does have the potential to inverse which is very interesting. 

BS Formula for Perspective :

Profit = Sale price - Purchase price - Additive - Demurrage - Broker Fees - operational costs - tank fees - taxes - habor maintenance fee - etc

So like you see there are alot of costs and many absolute retards are saying, ""THE CONTANGO THOU"", which really was my inspiration here. Contango falls to fucking shit when you factor in additional costs. 

CONTANGO NO EQUAL : Jan lower Purchase Price & Mar higher Sale Price. Don't think in a goddam vacum, but understand the definition is a definition and doesn't define the full picture. So basically the way you should see it is trader's/firms face backwardation in that their value is going to tank based on external costs. 

Yo also often you ROLL the position you're pricing too out to legally cook your books from what I've seen. I expect most traders have their positions rolled out May to July and if this is the case then you'll see more of a financial impact second quarter based on my spotty accounting knowledge. 

TLDR: Read the Contango section and start blasting the morons who are obsessing over it and ignoring the million other factors. Otherwise gas fees are expensive AF.

These animals will become worthless to the producer once they get too big.(they will begin eating more food then they can put on in fat/meat and will cost more money than they are worth at the market that they can't even get into)  They will shoot them before they pay them past the point of profitability. we are talking about tens of thousands of animals a day being rejected and potentially hundreds of thousands of animals being euthanized. This means products like Tyson pork and chicken not being on the grocery store shelves. Or Smithfield products such as sausages and bacon and a lot of brand names you would recognize. Also, Smithfield supplies a lot of restaurant chains namely Arby's with their ham. (not that the restaurants are open right now to use the meat but if they were to open it could be a problem).

This means less food going to the shelves and prices will skyrocket short-term.  Probably won't last forever but we are going to see a squeeze.

Combine this with the fact that China's pig stock was decimated by 75% last year from the African swine flu and they asked United States to ramp up production and anticipate sending them nearly double the exports to help make up for this loss. Now that the American barns are full as fuck the coronavirus happens and we are having no way to get these pigs to China. China has since started importing tens of thousands of pigs and sows from other countries, mainly France. That means if we are able to get transportation open that there may be nowhere for this excess of pigs to go which will be throwing gasoline on the flames.

egg producers are in the same boat because restaurants are no longer buying breaker liquid eggs. The turn around on these eggs from chicken to toilet is roughly less than a week. The freezers are already full and Barns are euthanizing hundreds of thousands of birds and those that haven't been killed have had their diet change to reduce and stop are egg-laying processes.  the full of eggs can be effectively stalled out quickly but it cannot be started back up nearly as fast call the price of eggs is going to go to the Moon as well. This means whole egg products, liquid egg products, omelets or other products that use eggs as ingredients are going to see a price increase. (Think McDonald's breakfast and dozen egg packs on the grocery store shelves)

I'm not sure whether to buy puts on the big producers like Tyson or Hormel or if the skyrocketing prices will actually generate excess revenue greater than the lower volume at a lower price would have. I'm not that smart.


Also with oil being so cheap nobody is buying corn because it's not profitable to make ethanol which means there are no ddg's going into the animal feed to begin with. Combine that with a possible reduced animal population (after the cull) and the future of grain isn't looking super good. What's the point of growing it if there's no animals to feed it to or ethanol to make from it? Looking at a possible FAT surplus. 

That means less $ going to the hands of producers which in turn means they're not going to be buying things like expensive genetics seeds or fancy new tractors from companies like John Deere. we Major egg manufacturers stop selling products is kind of hard for them to not lay off work force. The fact that they are all you need will not fare well for these companies as they will have to continue to pay employees to produce nothing. The ripple effect will be felt all the way down the line...

Take this information for what you will as it is not intended to be investing advise.


This will likely be national news shortly, it's already all over the news the major ag producing parts of the country.

Now go get that money. Or at the very least, stock your freezer.

679,Discussion,Shake Shack is returning its PPP Loan. Here’s why:,49,g4sbpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4sbpe/shake_shack_is_returning_its_ppp_loan_heres_why/,28,1587416392.0,"A letter from Danny Meyer and Randy Garutti

On March 27, when both branches of Congress and the White House came to an agreement to provide sweeping financial assistance via the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, many of us in the restaurant industry cheered with a big sigh of relief. This pandemic, and the consequential shut-down of an entire industry that relies upon the gathering of people - at a moment when people cannot gather- had already shown that no restaurant is unsinkable. With slim margins in our industry to begin with, restaurants of all sizes and flavors were vulnerable and laying off people by the hundreds. Indeed, both Shake Shack and Union Square Hospitality Group needed to make those tough decisions too, furloughing or laying off hundreds of team members throughout our respective companies—one a publicly traded company, the other an independent restaurant group. 

Restaurants function as the lifeblood of the U.S. economy and the nation's spirit. The bulk of the over $800 billion that restaurant-goers spend on dining out flows right back into the economy with much of that impact going to the very small businesses this PPP loan was intended to reach. The CARES Act was touted as the largest economic stimulus package in U.S. history and on its initial face, for restaurants, there seemed to be a lot to like in the bill.

With the country facing a prospective permanent loss of restaurants up and down the food chain, the bill arrived just in the nick of time. The onus was placed on each business to figure out how, when, or even if to apply. The “PPP” came with no user manual and it was extremely confusing. Both Shake Shack (a company with 189 restaurants in the U.S., employing nearly 8,000 team members) and Union Square Hospitality Group (with over 2,000 employees) arrived at a similar conclusion. The best chance of keeping our teams working, off the unemployment line and hiring back our furloughed and laid off employees, would be to apply now and hope things would be clarified in time.

While the program was touted as relief for small businesses, we also learned it stipulated that any restaurant business – including restaurant chains – with no more than 500 employees per location would be eligible. We cheered that news, as it signaled that Congress had gotten the message that as both as an employer, and for the indispensable role we play in communities, restaurants needed to survive. There was no fine print, anywhere, that suggested: “Apply now, or we will run out of money by the time you finally get in line.”

Few, if any restaurants in America employ more than 500 people per location. That meant that Shake Shack - with roughly 45 employees per restaurant – could and should apply to protect as many of our employees’ jobs as possible. The immediate drop in business due to the virus had caused the company to face operating losses of over $1.5 million each week, simply by keeping our doors open with the goal of paying our people and feeding our communities. Our teams have been heroic, pivoting our business to a new curbside pickup and delivery model, while keeping our teams and guests at a safe distance.

For Union Square Hospitality Group, the decision as to whether or not to apply for PPP loans was more complicated. All USHG restaurants closed as of March 13th, and with no revenue, the company was forced to lay off over 2000 employees. Since the PPP loans would be forgivable only if employees were hired back by June, and since most USHG restaurants are based in New York City where that timeline is unlikely achievable for full service restaurants, that application decision relied upon our conviction that one day we would be able to pay back the loan. After careful consideration, USHG opted to apply for PPP loans, taking on the risk in order to hire back laid off employees as soon as possible. Some USHG loans have been funded, and we await the day we’re able to re-open.   

Late last week, when it was announced that funding for the PPP had been exhausted, businesses across the country were understandably up in arms. If this act were written for small businesses, how is it possible that so many independent restaurants whose employees needed just as much help were unable to receive funding? We now know that the first phase of the PPP was underfunded, and many who need it most, haven’t gotten any assistance.  

Shake Shack was fortunate last Friday to be able to access the additional capital we needed to ensure our long term stability through an equity transaction in the public markets. We’re thankful for that and we’ve decided to immediately return the entire $10 million PPP loan we received last week to the SBA so that those restaurants who need it most can get it now.

We urge Congress to ensure that all restaurants no matter their size have equal ability to get back on their feet and hire back their teams. We are an industry of 660,000 restaurants with nearly 16 million employees. While it is heartening to see that an additional $310 billion in PPP funding is about to be approved, in order to work for restaurants, this time we need to do it better.

Fund it adequately. It’s inexcusable to leave restaurants out because no one told them to get in line by the time the funding dried up. That unfairly pits restaurants against restaurants. This industry rises and falls together. And if there is a concern that once again the government will have not allocated adequate funding, then send business to the front of the PPP line which has more limited access to outside funding. 
Assign to each applying restaurant a local bank that will be responsible for executing the loan assuming the restaurant has satisfied eligibility requirements. Too many restaurants have been left out of the program simply because they lacked a pre-existing banking or loan relationship.
Eliminate the arbitrary June forgiveness date for PPP loans. This virus has moved in waves with a different timeline in different parts of our country. Instead, make all PPP loans forgivable if an adequate number of employees are rehired by a minimum 6 months following the date that a restaurant’s state (or city) has permitted a full reopening to the public.
If this health crisis and the associated economic shock has taught us anything, it is that we are all in this together. Restaurants and their employees are craving the moment when we can safely be back in business and bring our guests back to the table. With adequate funding and some necessary tweaks, the PPP program can provide the economic spark the entire industry needs to get back in business. 

Shake Shack, like all restaurant businesses in America, is doing the best we can to navigate these challenging times. We don’t know what the future holds. Our people would benefit from a $10 million PPP loan but we’re fortunate to now have access to capital that others do not. Until every restaurant that needs it has had the same opportunity to receive assistance, we’re returning ours.

The peak in the VIX is typically followed by a bear market rally, and the market then makes new lows.

For example, in 2008 the VIX peaked in October, followed by a 24% bear market rally into December. Subsequently, the SPX troughed four months after the VIX peaked – in March 2009.

The current bear market rally is larger, but not that dis-similar in magnitude to those seen in 2001 and 2008. If the market follows the same path today as in 2008-09, then that could see the SPX reach a low near the end of July, at a level of 1900, down 30% from current spot.

Estimating the lows: Instead of using just 2008, we take the average ratio from every crash, between the SPX level at the VIX peak and the eventual lows. That suggests an anticipated trough around 2140. Alternatively 1935, if we use the average of just the recessionary instances.

Timing the low: Recessionary bear markets are typically very long. The duration between VIX peak and SPX trough also tends to be longer in deeper recessions. On average, spot lows come 140 days after the VIX peak during recessions, vs just 42 days in all crashes. Applying those averages to the VIX peak on 16 March, would imply market lows between mid-April and early August. The risk to this view, is that it takes longer for the economy to recover. If the crash morphs into a more typical recessionary one in terms of length, then we may not see the lows until late next year.

The oil in Alberta was, technically, available for free and someone would pay you to take it away. The price has now stabilised slightly at under $5.

**What does this mean?**

No one really knows.  The oil analysts online are in disbelief and struggling to make sense of it.

**Any early thoughts?**

Here is some of the commentary from online.

* The USA and Canada have lost the oil war to the Russians and Saudi's
* That green new deals are now inevitable, we are witnessing the decline of oil
* The pandemic merely accelerated an inevitable
* The Federal Reserve may start buying oil (no joke, analysts are already discussing how it would happen)

**How does that even work?**

* It would cost them more to stop producing than to produce at a loss.
* Storage is full so they want to keep producing to keep people employed even though it is negative

Make from all of this what you will but we are witnessing history every single day during this period.  Trump is going to lose his mind when he wakes up.

I recently saw a bullish post on Snapchat based on Technicals. Let me offer my (bearish) perspective based on fundamentals.

**The report**

Snapchat released [this report](https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/blog/how-snapchatters-are-adapting-to-the-covid-19-health-crisis) on April 1st to brag about increased user engagement. Specifically, ""a **36% increase** in install volume for app ads, and a **19% increase** in swipe-up rate overall during late March compared to late February"".

Now, that's good. We now have a concrete number of how much more people used snapchat, specifically, how much their revenue increased. Unfortunately, Snap didn't give a percent increase for other parts of the app. We'll assume they're worse.

Also, they decided to add into this report that they're making ""medical face shields, which will be donated to augment the N95 masks we’ve given to hospitals in need"". Donated. They said donated. Pretty sure this will be insignificant to their bottom line though.

**Ad Revenue**

It's no secret, we know ad revenue is down. By how much? Youtube partners are experiencing around a [50% drop](https://www.reddit.com/r/PartneredYoutube/comments/fs26f7/revenue_down_is_this_related_to_covid19/), so we'll assume the same for Snapchat.

**Estimating Snapchat's Revenue**

WARNING: I am retarded. Please do not make a trade solely off of this number.

Q4 2019 gross revenue was $446.2M, and total expenses were $674.19M, about an even split among  R&D, general administrative, and normal operating costs.

Let's say Snapchat app revenue is cut by 50%, then boosted up by, let's be generous and say 30% (this is assuming more app installs than swipe-ups, and assuming all other segments are up this amount). 446.2\*0.5\*1.3 = **$290.03M**. That is their total revenue, estimated. A drop of 35%.

**Corrections**

Okay, I'm retarded, these numbers are wrong. Not only did I assume the ad rev drop was for the whole quarter, I used the wrong quarter's revenue as last quarter and also missed expenses.

Snap's ACTUAL revenue last quarter was **$560.9M**. This actually isn't organic growth and mostly an increase in ad prices for the holiday season. We'll be generous and assume that despite the natural drop in advertising in January Snapchat really grew a lot.

0.5\*1.3 = 0.65. They will have an estimated 65% of normal revenue because of coronavirus in March. Since that is one month, (2.65/3) = 88.3% is the percent of normal revenue they'll report this quarter. 560.9\*0.883 = **$495M**. A 11.7% drop in revenue. Much less disappointing I know. And among wall street, this is actually a fairly high estimate, which reflects that we were generous in our numbers.

TL;DR: This post essentially says nothing. 11.7% drop in revenue is conservative.",2020-04-20 08:02:25,-0.9465,-0.5423,0.1103583061889251,-0.45948056460369163

[Position](https://imgur.com/a/cytdqyR)

**My play:** dumping before earnings or legging them out to further OTM calls if there is a strong run up. Save a few to exercise and wheel them until I'm exercised.

**Estimated earnings date:** 05/06/2020. $ATVI and $GLUU also have earnings that week.

I'd love some feedback. So let me know why and how I'm a retard. I already got in with 50 calls. I got burned by the witching hype. So just letting you know how smooth my brain is.

**Thesis:** Entertainment spending has not been significantly affected yet by Coronavirus(see $NFLX subscription count) and people are entertaining themselves on their phones(see $SNAP +20% DAU). These easy conclusions could lead to a runup for Zynga to earnings. Also, smooth brains spending stimulus money. $500 per kid and $1200 per adult.

**Back of napkin math:** If Zynga sees a 20% increase in DAU that translates to \~107m(4M additional DAU at $0.223 per day) additional revenue on the high side. Zynga's Q1 is typically a slower quarter, so $375m revenue was probably their projection when they gave the 1.6bn guidance. 33% of that $107m puts them at $410m on the quarter. This is inline with analyst estimates but it doesn't include the progress that they've made in Asia or the impact of content updates to older proven games.

* Snapchat just saw a 20% increase in DAU(daily active users). More smooth brains on their phones.
* Netflix blew out subscriptions estimates, so entertainment spending is still strong. NetFlix sub is $8.99, monthly spend on Zynga is $6.69 on a DAU.

Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Brief Background**

In case you’ve been in a coma for the past few days, you’ve probably already probably know about the crash in oil prices and what $USO is. It’s an extremely popular Oil ETF and used as a mechanism for retail investors to speculate on the price of oil without actually needing to deal with futures, and potential complications that come with them like negative prices and being forced to accept delivery - something a lot of people probably found out about yesterday. This Oil ETF has grown to be massively popular in the past few days. Here’s some of their stats as of April 21 2020 closing from their website.

[USO 4\/21 Stats](https://preview.redd.it/kb79o4jzz9u41.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee37a1d967c134a83367ba3cc987d4703482f0d)

**Buying The Dip**

They’ve got almost $3 ~~Trillion~~ Billion (apparently, I'm dyslexic) in Net Assets, most of which came in the past few weeks as a massive flood of retail investors came in to “buy the dip”. They went from 156 million shares outstanding at Feb 29 to 1.1 billion shares on April 20th. We’ll go back to how that works and why that matters later. They’ve also become extremely popular on Robinhood, with it being the top bought stock recently, which I (subjectively) take it as a red flag.

[Robinhood users holding USO](https://preview.redd.it/3r2jmum30au41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=116a24ea155ac86ed266f9fe77db6ae7fc03bded)

This spike in demand has been causing this ETF to have several problems recently. A few days ago, it became so big that it held 25% of all front-month oil futures outstanding, forcing it to restructure what assets it held because of regulations. There's also theories out there that the fact that USO holds so many contracts was one of the causes of the May contract crashing so dramatically yesterday. Today, demand for their shares increased to the point where they were temporarily no longer able to issue more shares until the SEC approved the registration of new shares they filed yesterday. The caused USO to no longer reflect anywhere close to what the true price of the underlying assets.

**How USO Works**

USO, currently as structured, ~~holds 80% of their value in front month futures and 20% in second month futures~~ (won't be true in a few days, see edit below). In theory, the ETF price should equal the value of the shares of the underlying assets, right? Well, that’s not what happened today.

Look at the “Premium Discount” number. This is the percentage the ETF’s market value is over or under the actual underlying asset. It’s supposed to be extremely small, at least when markets make sense. But the amount of “buy the dip” bulls irrationally bought USO shares, causing the price dislocation we see today, where USO is worth 36% more than the underlying asset.

[Q4 USO Premium \/ Discount Day Count](https://preview.redd.it/5hy319k80au41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aca9b8dd1f7ec7683b318a64f11d3226280c4fa)

In normal markets, seeing a premium or discount of more than 1% for USO is pretty rare, and the ETF price usually reflects the actual oil futures. Usually, when there is a premium between the ETF price and Net Asset Value, USO’s Authorized Purchasers would purchase more of the underlying assets and issue additional shares until the ETF market price is the same as the asset’s price, giving them a nice arbitrage opportunity to make easy money. The problem is that the sudden spike in bulls trying to bet on oil made it so that this mechanism cannot be used until the SEC approves the registration of the new shares they need to do this.

So, what happens when USO's share registration does get approved? USO's Authorized Purchasers will start printing new shares like they’re JPowell trying to cure COVID-19 with his money printer until USO drops enough (i.e. to $2.06, or whatever the NAV is) to reflect the actual prices of the futures they hold. This seems to be the rare instance of arbitrage in the stock market, and I’m kind of shocked some hedge fund hasn’t taken advantage of this by shorting USO.

**Why hasn't anyone taken advantage of this yet?**

Okay, so there's a clear arbitrage opportunity here, why hasn't some MM or hedge fund taken opportunity of this? I was wondering this too, and jumped on a call with a friend who works in the ETF space, so here's my best understanding of what he explained to me. Say you're managing billions of dollars and you see this, knowing that the SEC will be approving the share registration in a few days. Seeing the oil prices the past few days you don't want any oil exposure, so you don't want to take the risk of short oil and thus can't short USO outright. If you want to take advantage of this, while remaining neutral on oil, you would short USO while buying the underlying futures to hedge against changes in the oil prices. The problem with this is now you're holding oil futures for June, which you found out yesterday can in fact go negative and you might have difficulty unwinding your trade, which itself is too much risk for you to take, so you stay out of it.

Links to sources in comments because automod blocks this post if I add them here.

TLDR; Dumb bulls are pumping USO to the point where its price no longer reflects actual oil prices because USO is waiting for SEC approval to correct it (which according to my ETF friend takes a day or two). USO 2.50p 4/24 and pray that oil futures don't go up more than 36% in the meanwhile.

EDIT - Apparently, USO announced today that is now changing their holdings to be 40% June, 55% July, 5% August, although it doesn't look like they've started the process of rolling their futures yet, which might affect things, although the NAV should theoretically be the same

EDIT2 (4/22, 10AM) - June futures is up 40% and USO is down 5% as I write this, which basically eliminates most of the NAV premium, still overvalued by about 15% using back-of-the-napkin calculations, going to start closing out my positions. Whatever hedge funds did this trade while remaining neutral oil (i.e. hedged by going long on futures while short on USO) just made alot of money. Keep in eye out for future opportunities to profit of off greedy ""buy the dip"" bull retail investors next time June futures go down.

**Special Menu item #1** 

The general idea is that Air Canada is basically circulating through the loopholes of paperwork for government taxation and relief. This airline has recent contributions to aid the pandemic that we all know about. Which their active efforts is through the assertive measures of emptying the international flights of consumers; and their contaminate properties. I mean, they ripped out all the passenger seats to use it for cargo. [https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-air-canada-converting-three-boeing-777s-to-cargo-only-2020-4](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-air-canada-converting-three-boeing-777s-to-cargo-only-2020-4) [https://globalnews.ca/news/6812909/canadian-airlines-suspend-flights-coronavirus/](https://globalnews.ca/news/6812909/canadian-airlines-suspend-flights-coronavirus/) 

**Combo # 2 The most fluid general idea.**

 The suspension of flights may not entirely go to waste or dip the problematic gestures for the lack of 'consumer' flights. Flight seats can range from person to person, which generates a lot of carbon emission. This carbon emission is the influx of kinetic energy for people to even get to the airport. This is what frictions to what causes people to be layered away off work, as general businesses has shifted into a different track of essential expertise. [https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/g0q03v/air\_canada\_suspends\_international\_flights\_until/](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/g0q03v/air_canada_suspends_international_flights_until/) 

**Kids menu #3 It is a lot like building blocks.** 

However. Business is resumed as normal; on paper. Employees are kept on; planes are being used toward the growing new direction of the present economy. [https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/fx86n6/air\_canada\_to\_rehire\_16500\_laidoff\_workers\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/fx86n6/air_canada_to_rehire_16500_laidoff_workers_with/) Empty seats does not mean empty skies. Planes have other purposes than to deliver the noise of our masses. Bringing people back home from all directions are humanely and ambassador-like duties where blank cheques or favours are done in exchange to help during the crisis. In other words, Airlines still got paid to bring or send everyone home before closure. 

**Combo bucket #4** 

Because we're too gullible to see the other side of the coin. Using the air for trade-relations or assistive deliveries of empty local and international skies to deliver goods such as masks to other areas of the world can be more beneficial in tax relief as an asset to society than as a tool to amazon-ship humanoids all across the globe. These sky-busses are what brings trade relations an important value and asset for Canada to have, as a neutral country that can aid the relations of other countries. Which actually provides more tax incentives and assistance. 

**Combo #5. The consumers are the boomers** 

We have the everyday chumps such as these folks; [https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/fxc3v1/is\_air\_canada\_ac\_out\_of\_the\_woods\_what\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/fxc3v1/is_air_canada_ac_out_of_the_woods_what_is/) Where boomers and non-boomers alike think it may be a good time to buy (AC) as the stock market ""simply"" had a reduction. With all the extra cash that Canadians are holding, I'm sure we've had friends or family mention or ask what would be a good thing to buy. The thing is, it's hard to decipher what is to be true or not because of all the market manipulation

* Higher server costs are no doubt eating into margins (as seen with NFLX today)
* 1.8K P/E and serious competition speaks for itself

If we can estimate the breakdown new free users vs. new paid users, we can predict the downfall better than the fools making wild guesses based on higher site traffic or MAUs (yes, that's what they're doing…). Pitch in by becoming a data point in [**this Google survey**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10iTqtP6WvrSMsVTCJhE16CABl4KFltZvJgMuJE3wxl8).

We're at 38 responses so far ([original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g51joe/who_is_winning_the_videochat_war_survey_inside/)). The results are public, and I'll share proper findings if we hit a sample of 100+.

TLDR: Long-term ZM puts, strike pending survey results.

**Update 4/22**: We got 133 responses! This obviously isn't a proper poll (let's just say Nate Silver would not approve) but it's at least some directional data in the absence of an alternative.

A couple of takeaways:

* The breakdown of free vs. paid *new* business users is about 50/50, higher than I expected.
* No surprises here: Compared to the other videohat apps, ZM is being used for free more often. These free users are likely a drain on resources, using it more hours/week vs. competitors. One caveat is that its paid users use it for fewer hours/week vs. competitors.

So, I wound't be surprised if they beat new customer estimates (but with thin or negative margins) in May's earnings, just like NFLX. I'm making a compromise with myself to only buy 2021 puts since I'm still bearish about ZM's dot-com-bubble valuation. After all, it's not novel or unique enough to deserve such a multiplier, and Google, Microsoft, Cisco, etc. will not lose this war.

(here's their website:  [http://www.uscfinvestments.com/](http://www.uscfinvestments.com/) )

Did they properly account for the possibility of negative prices? If they didn't, shouldn't they be holding big chunk of the risk? Is there a risk of seeing USCF going bankrupt, their remaining ETFs getting busted as well? What would that do to people's trust in ETFs? God knows how will the public react to ETF issuing company crumbling...

There's increasing evidence some brokers also messed up dealing with negative oil prices. Is there a risk of the oil crisis spilling over to financials, as it took it by surprise? Interactive brokers took a big hit, god knows how Robinhood handled it. 

Does it even make sense to gamble on your casino going bankrupt?

Am I just being paranoid? Probably, but I guess I need some reassurance from people who understand the internals of the financials machinery.

EDIT: I'm looking at USCF. They have 14 other commodities ETFs they manage, some of them are just as bad (natural gas, live cattle?! there is probably a price for killing live cattle, this can also go negative). What happens if USCF gets bankrupt from mishandling negative oil prices? The rest of their ETFs need selling because no more company managing them, is that correct? 

Also, any one knows the extent of USCF shenanigans? it's begging to look like they have managed to confuse the industry supply chain demand discovery with futures by giving their clients ""commodity exposure"".",2020-04-22 03:59:04,-0.9946,0.0,0.5706,-0.14133333333333334

TLDR: More than 27 percent of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine died, and 22 percent of those treated with the combination therapy died, compared with an 11.4 percent death rate in those not treated with the drugs, the study said. The results were from an observational study of outcomes and were not part of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which is the gold standard for testing drugs.

In particular, on April 21, 2020, USO invested in approximately 40% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the June contract, approximately 55% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the July contract and approximately 5% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the August contract, except when the front month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case the futures contracts held by USO will be rolled into the July contract, August contract and September contract. In addition, commencing on April 22, 2020, USO in response to ongoing extraordinary market conditions in the crude oil markets, including super contango, may invest in the above described crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in any month available or in varying percentages or invest in any other of the permitted investments described below and in its prospectus, without further disclosure. USO intends to attempt to continue tracking USO’s benchmark as closely as possible, however significant tracking deviations may occur above and beyond the differences described herein. USO’s portfolio holdings as of the end of the prior business day are posted each day on the website: www.uscfinvestments.com/uso. As stated in the prospectus for USO, USO seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in futures contracts for light, sweet crude oil, other types of crude oil, diesel-heating oil, gasoline, natural gas, and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, ICE Futures Europe and ICE Futures U.S. (together, “ICE Futures”) or other U.S. and foreign exchanges (collectively, “Oil Futures Contracts”) and to a lesser extent, in order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, other oil-related investments such as cash-settled options on Oil Futures Contracts, forward contracts for oil, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded (“over-the-counter” or “OTC”) transactions that are based on the price of oil, other petroleum-based fuels, Oil Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, “Other Oil Related Investments”). Market conditions that USCF currently anticipates could cause USO to invest in Other Oil-Related Investments include those allowing USO to obtain greater liquidity or to execute transactions with more favorable pricing. (For convenience and unless otherwise specified, Oil Futures Contracts and Other Oil-Related Investments collectively are referred to as “Oil Interests” in the prospectus.) The foregoing may impact the performance of USO. In addition, as a result of these changes, USO may not be able to track the Benchmark Futures Contract or meet its investment objective, which is for the daily percentage changes in the NAV per share to reflect the daily percentage changes of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil, as measured by the daily percentage changes in the price of Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, plus interest earned on USO’s collateral holdings, less USO’s expenses.

Short version of this:

Market was exploiting USO. USO changed their prospectus.

Current holdings:

40% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the June contract, approximately 55% of its portfolio in crude oil futures contracts on the NYMEX and ICE Futures in the July contract, 5% in aug is the current holdings.

Expect those June and July contracts to continue to be rolled by USO. Expect their NAV to continue to be hit. Expect that they may take money and buy things like swaps and other instuments.

In the future after this, USO will not be nearly as good of a short, but their NAV should be chopped down over the next few days from contango. Short calls and long puts should print for the next few days, but I recommend closing any long puts you have in the next few days, and watching short calls carefully.

IV should drop on USO, so your short calls should do even better, but long puts will get squished.

Look to exit your puts in the next few days, monitor your short calls. USO is going to have to move A LOT, value wise, in the next month or two to overcome how fucked it has got, so your short calls should still be OK. You have a giant ass buffer on them with the sky high IV.

If you trade futures, shorting Jun and Jul may be good, USO is selling, that should pressure it downward. If you are smart, you can front run USO tonight and short CL Jun and Jul at futures open.

If you want to make money and don't mind living dangerously, short calls on USO.  IV is BONKERS, so you get paid super well, and contango is going to fuck this thing harder than I can fuck your mom.  All the rolling will crush NAV over the next few days, and contango will do the rest.

Let’s think two steps down the road… It is summer if 2020… Government lifted the lockdowns and the economy is reviving. The world is recovering and there are couple of hidden players and side-markets that see the biggest gains. Here’s a little forecast report that put the spotlight on some of the less known players who might turn huge gains in a couple months. Enjoy!

**Aviation:**

· Containment measures work over time; commercial air traffic enters a protracted period of lower growth as consumers are reluctant to travel.

· Major European low-cost airlines start declaring bankruptcies due to lack of government support. Norwegian, Virgin Australian airlines among the ones to be forced for bankruptcy or liquidation

· Aircraft leasing companies such as AerCap, Air Leasing, BOCA sit on large volume of assets are still getting paid by airlines regardless of travel volume. So they are good. They are currently oversold due to crisis, and yet their earnings will remain unaffected. Some leasing companies like AerCap will be offered shares in exchange of lease payments from carriers like Norwegian (see the story [here](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/irish-aircraft-lessor-aercap-could-be-offered-shares-in-norwegian-air-1.4230789)

· Defense players like Lockheed and Raytheon stay fucking flat

**Hospitality:**

· Nevada becomes one of the first states to re-open due to the immense pressure Nevadan put on Gov. Steve Sisolak. Trump does not confront this since he’s a good friend of Sisolak and is empathetic with casino leaders since he ran and plunged one. Caesar and Wynn partially re-open in mid-May, which lead to their stocks skyrocketing

· Some insider trading has already been noticed at Ceaser (NYSE:CZR). [Tony Zhang Breaks Down An Interesting Caesars Entertainment Options Trade](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/options/20/04/15836145/tony-zhang-breaks-down-an-interesting-caesars-entertainment-options-trade)

**Technology & Ecommerce**

· A good chunk of the population receives their relief checks, tax returns, and those who are still employed have amassed a ton of savings to spend on online shopping. Macy’s, Shopify, Etsy are among the ones to report positive earnings in Q2

· Facebook (thanks to IG) & Netflix report record highs due to influx of new users and subscribers. Their ad revenues, which make up a good chunk of their revenue, go off the roof

· Zoom Technologies and Cisco go through a small correction as less people start using it

· Thermal imaging devices that Flir produces become widely adopted at airports to avoid the second wave of the virus

· Ed-Tech companies’ stocks soar. Arco Platform Limited (NYSE:ARCE), which delivers educational content to private schools, students report record earnings. Instructure, Inc. (NYSE:INST) and Perdoceo Education Corporation (PRDO) are others that see highs by mid-July

**Food & Beverage**

· Alcohol companies beat their earnings as quarantine drinking exceeds regular consumption levels. Weather gets warmer and people want to slowly celebrate post quarantine with beer, liquor and wine

· Companies like Diageo and Constellation Brands, AV InBev and Brown-Forman recover quickly from the crisis

· Kroger (NYSE:KR) is one of the few names that are still positive for the year and for good reason. As a pivotal necessity in any circumstance, KR stock represents consistent demand due to its sophisticated preservation and distribution capabilities

· Costco (NYSE:COST) surprisingly beats its rivals. Average Costco shopper typically makes about $100,000 a year and this makes the company more resilient to economic downturns. When things bounce back in summer, Costco will continue enjoy strong demand

**Biotech**

· Abbott (NYSE:ABT) announces that it is launching the final test for SARS-CoV-2 -- and its first antibody test for the coronavirus. In addition, Moderna beats Gilead in building the vaccine for the treatment and gets FDA approval in fall for distribution

· Chinese-made coronavirus antibody tests become available in the U.S. thanks to tiny Aytu Bioscience  (NYSE:AYTU). The company beats its competitors in diagnosis accuracy and becomes a winner in the anybody race

**What This Means**

With this news it promises an actual means of treating the Corona Virus backed by real medical proof. This article is huge, in terms for the market, just look at what had happened to Gilead Sciences when there was a rumor they had a treatment that worked. Ivermectin has a success that bears a 99.99% correlation between it working. Which means that it is reasonable to believe that this treatment will show results and is not just a simple placebo. This also isn't a rumor this is backed by real medical professionals and research institutes.

**Some Key Takeaways**

With this new treatment we are looking at a decrease in hospital mortality of around 84%. This study was tested in 169 hospitals in 3 different countries. This treatment causes less required time in hospital care which could greatly free up ER’s across the world and give more beds. Based on the recommended dosage of 150mcg/Kg the drug is reportedly safe.

**Why We Need a Treatment**

The vaccine for Corona virus is not near yet but even if it was the recent South Korean \[South Korean study\]([https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/17/836747242/in-south-korea-a-growing-number-of-covid-19-patients-test-positive-after-recover](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/17/836747242/in-south-korea-a-growing-number-of-covid-19-patients-test-positive-after-recover)) is proving that someone can get reinfected with Corona Virus. What that means is hypothetically someone vaccinated might stand a big risk of still getting Corona Virus. A vaccine might not be the cure all for this situation. So a treatment will be able to sway the number of cases and mortality down for the years to comes.

 - alcohol has historically done well through recessions.
 - dominos trading real high. What is more American than pizza **and beer**?
 - production seems to be continuing.
 - by all accounts of people I've spoken to, everyone is drinking more booze than they were pre-corona.

Edit - a lot of people saying demand will go off a cliff due to bars restaurant and event closure. Ultimately this is immaterial if demand is just redirected to retail bottled beer.

Edit 2 - other people saying production is compromised due to production lines being tooled toward kegs - couldn't they tap kegs and pull into 1L plastic bottles as a last resort (craft breweries have been doing this for years).

Edit 3 - people hating on bud - fair point, I don't drink it either. But dominos isn't exactly a great pizza either - and have you seen the other craft beer / seltzer brands they acquired? Also when times are tight people will probably gravitate toward value brands and away from premium brands.

Have I missed something? This seems like a huge BUY right now.

For anyone interested there's 2 more key points that serves as a big boost to inbev. 

1. Beer production requires CO2 as an input which has been in short supply due to the oil crises. However ironically, fermentation actually produces CO2. However harvesting it is only done in the big breweries this means smaller breweries are struggling to make beer whereas bigger breweries aren't. Sources in comments below.

2. Smaller craft breweries typically attract more sales (%wise) from on premise sales, and some aren't even equipped to bottle their own beer. Because of this, they've had to turn to 3rd party bottling plants. I'm willing to bet that inbev is on the receiving end of a lot of work to bottle competitors beers. Essentially that would give them control over their competitors. Source was Neilson survey data mentioned below.

3. Value / renowned brands have benefited from a sales boost as customers stock up for isolation. I spoke to an area manager (similar to guy who commented below) who said the brands they're seeing big sales on aren't the flashy crafties, it's the stock standard true blue brands. I'm based in Aussie so can't say for sure it's the same story in America, but willing to bet some of that holds. Also read a few articles saying bud has been selling well from Neilson survey data (read comments below).

**TLDR:** Sell Bull Call spread on TSLA

Here's my DD. Going to be very tough for this to go higher than $700. It's gone straight up from $450s to $770s. I think it goes lower or stays below $700 because:

* Oil prices at historic lows, less reason to buy electric vehicle
* Less people buying luxury cars (even Model 3 is $50k or more with decent options)
* Economy hurting / potential depression / loss of jobs = less buyers of 50-100k cars.

See chart :

\- Gap fill downside is $650. Breaks below that, we're at $600 from previous resistance.

&#x200B;

**My play:**

Use the vertical bull call spread to take advantage of high IV and limit risk. high probability of success and great risk/reward ratio.

Sell 5 contracts of a Bull Call Spread for May 15 710/700 , pays you $5.85 net credit.  
(Buy 710 call, Sell 700 call).

Very good risk/reward considering TESLA can still go UP from today's stock price of $687 and you still make money. You would just need TSLA to stay under $700 to make money.

Doing a quick search on the top company - Dow Chemical - we can see historical articles discussing how they increased earnings in the previous oil routes like in 2015-2016. Long story short, cheaper oil might decrease their revenue but increases their bottom line meaning greater EPS and greater stock price.

10-k was filed yesterday that indicates rollover will happen on May 5-8: https://twitter.com/QuisitiveInvest/status/1252412411295920131

This means that USO will be attempting to sell ~25% of the outstanding /CLK contracts in two and a half week to then buy the next month contracts(the same for the 20% that will rolled from july to august). Now just yesterday the concept of negative WTI futures was proven to be a real possibility; every trader should know how the market is capable of ignoring a potential outcome until it happens for the first time. 

/CLK is currently trading at 13$ with a massive unwind coming up. With a publicly available announcement that 25% of outstanding contracts will be unwound in the near future, there is a very real chance speculators try to front-run this to escape the scenario we say yesterday. (Yes I'm aware its down a shit ton today, but as we saw it doesn't stop at $0)

Further reasons USO is fucked:

- USO inflows have been record high in the last week, entirely coming from retail investors who think they're investing in oil at its current spot price. https://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1251493231394775041. At some point this is going to puke.

- Most states are still shut down, and federal guidelines recommend 14 days of declining cases before opening up. There is almost zero reason storage capacity should open up before June contracts deliver.

- Contango is at a record high %

Potential ways USO fucks you instead: 

- Rumored OPEC meeting for May 10. Yes it's after rollover, but enough could leak to cause a slight pop.

- The same retarted retail can prop this garbage up well over NAV for god knows how long. USO was trading ~8% above NAV at close yesterday; right now its probably closer to 20-30%.

Usefulness of Ivermectin in COVID-19 Illness by Amit Patel :: SSRN

Importance: There is no established anti-viral therapy for treating COVID-19 illness.Objective: To study the usefulness of Ivermectin, an antimicrobial

The principal outcome was to assess the association of ivermectin administration with survival in COVID-19. Results: The cohort (including 704 ivermectin treated and 704 controls) was derived from 169 hospitals across 3 continents with COVID-19 illness. The patients were matched for age, sex, race or ethnicity, comorbidities and a illness severity score (qSOFA). Of those requiring mechanical ventilation fewer patients died in the ivermectin group (7.3% versus 21.3%) and overall death rates were lower with ivermectin (1.4% versus 8.5%; HR 0.20 CI 95% 0.11-0.37, p<0.0001).

Why is this good? 

* 1 - This is a CONTROLLED study. This provides much stronger evidence than Remdesivir at the possible efficacy of ivermectin.

* 2- Ivermectin dosage does NOT change in liver or kidney dysfunction: That means it will NOT become toxic in people with liver/kidney failure (like hydroxychloroquine). It's only contraindication is if you are specifically allergic to it.

Why should I care? It is sold under the brand name Stromectol, and produced by Merck. Merck's stock traded SIDEWAYS yesterday. Remember how Gilead stock shot up over 15% overnight off of a RUMOR?? This has strong evidence to do more than just maybe work, and it's not harsh on the system like an antiviral or choloroquinine.

MRK manufactures Ivermectin for human use. This isn't just a horse dewormer. Might be some tendies here.

TL;DR - MRK 90c 5/15 x30 contracts

The damn town of Dakota City, NE has a population of 2,000 people. It has spread over to Sioux City, IA. No one has been testing as much. Hell, the hospitals stopped testing for a couple weeks, for what I believe was a lack of testing kits.


Drive by any of the plants, and you'll see the media trying to get an answer, but they won't for a while. You would think they would try to temporarily close and sanitize, but who knows how well that will work.


Here's a little back story. Tyson has a subsidiary known as BPI or BPI Tyson. Ever since the movie, Super Size Me, BPI went under hot water due to the pink slime scandal.


[Pink Slime Article on BPI](https://mobile-reuters-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN0GC26220140812?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15874823931785&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-usa-beef-bpi-reopening-idUSKBN0GC26220140812)


BPI was on the brink of closing down. It still is. Hell, they even rebranded as ""Empirical Foods"". This is going to be worse than the Smithfields incident in Sioux Falls, SD. TSN is going to take a hit. Short TSN.

TLDR: TSN $50p 6/19 or 7/17

830,DD,Longing VIX before a crash that might not happen,28,g59oqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g59oqp/longing_vix_before_a_crash_that_might_not_happen/,17,1587477289.0,"First,  unlike many people on this sub, I do not believe that a sweeping downturn in the next month is inevitable. I do think it is likely and represents a good shorting opportunity, but we shouldn't count on it. If it does happen, I'm sure going to ride some of that wave down.

What  I do think is inevitable, however, is increasing anxiety about whether the market is going to take another plunge. Here is my reasoning. And  yes, I know that this is a breadline and that I'm wearing a bathrobe,  but bear with me:

1. One primary force that drove the rally was the massive short squeeze. One source states that \~65% of the rally came from this squeeze. Overall short interest on stocks has reached lows, suggesting that the rally is running out of steam.  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-force-thats-propelled-the-stock-market-rally-will-exhaust-itself-this-week-2020-04-13](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-force-thats-propelled-the-stock-market-rally-will-exhaust-itself-this-week-2020-04-13)
2. The  FED's primary role is to provide liquidity to the markets. It has achieved this goal, successfully placating many investors that there will be Armaggedon. However, with the rally running out of steam and the value of equities becoming less justifiable by the week, most institutional investors recognize this rally as being tenuous.  Institutional investors like Warren Buffett are still holding record levels of cash (Buffett himself over a hundred billion dollars).  Investors can be easily spooked in this environment.
3. The bad news is actually impacting the market (examples: bad bank earnings and oil going negative). However, there is no guarantee that a sell-off will occur. The fact that the president can go on twitter and blunt any downward movement with misleading/false announcements to pump the markets should be noted as a genuine obstacle to a consistent downward trend. 
4. VIX, in this environment, is truly a fear indicator. VIX does not track the volatility of the SPY. It tracks options on the SPY. Institutional investors may not want to sell, but they are certainly going to want to hedge to preserve their gains from the rally. That means they are buying puts as insurance, increasing the VIX. Unlike the stock market itself, the VIX is not subject to FED manipulation. 

tl;dr:  Even if a market downturn doesn't happen, VIX will still increase. If there is a market downturn, VIX will increase even more, as the trend downward is verified.

**A Brief History of Deutsche Bank (and Deutschland)**

Let’s first start with some background around Deutsche Bank, because it has some very interesting history behind it. In particular, it’s somehow taken part in causing some of the worst crises and scandals in world and economic history ever since its founding in 1870. Here’s a brief timeline:

* Founded in Berlin in 1870 with the original mission to facilitate trade between Germany and foreign nations
* Rapidly expanded overseas in the late 1800s, opening branches in London, Shanghai, and South America
* Financed the Holocaust in the 1930s, including the construction of the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Gestapo
* Broken up to 10 smaller banks after Germany’s defeat in WWII by the Allies, but those banks later merged back together less than 10 years later
* Acquired a bunch of overseas banks, including banks in the UK and the US, during the 80s and 90s, growing to become one of the largest money management firms in the world
* Drove the market for CDOs in 2007 and even created CDOs consisting of their bad subprime mortgages, somehow got an A-level rating on them from the rating agencies, and aggressively marketed the CDOs to investors while knowing that their CDOs were shit. Their head of CDO trading, Greg Lippmann, knew about this and told everyone that CDOs were effectively a Ponzi scheme, even shorting CDOs himself through Credit Default Swaps. He then went around to different funds in Wall Street and told them that CDOs were going to collapse and sold them Credit Default Swaps as a way to short the CDO market, creating synthetic CDOs, the asset on the other side of that trade, with them to sell to other investors. This entire scheme was the inspiration for The Big Short, in case you didn’t realize this by now.
* Also the bank that finances businesses of the current President, which might be worth considering for political motives / implications if something bad happens to Deutsche Bank
* Today, they focus on Corporate Banking, Investment Banking, Private Banking, and Asset Management

Let’s see how $DB’s performance has been the past few years

[$DB, 2002-2020, Monthly](https://preview.redd.it/x0a7r7x6i3u41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c81fcd6c44a250984dce8a7e42f3277192f54b)

Yikes, it went from an all time high of $140 in 2007 to $6 today in 2020. In terms of their market cap, it went from $70B from its 2007 peak to $13B today. So, what happened? Let’s look at their [2019 SEC annual filing](https://www.db.com/ir/en/download/Form_20-F_2019.pdf).

**10-K Deep Dive**

Income Statement (omitted boring parts)

|Revenue|€ 22.4B (Net Interest = 13.7B, Credit Losses = -723M, Commission & Feed = 9.5B) |
|:-|:-|
|Expenses|€ 25.1B (mostly Compensation and G&A) |
|Net income after taxes|€-5.3B (includes 2.6B of losses from taxes) |

From their interest income, 19% comes from Corporate Banking, 39% from Investment Banking, 30% from Private Banking, and the rest comes from some other various operations.

So in a good year, in a period of “high” interest rates in the US (at least relative to the past decade), Deutsche Bank is still somehow losing billions. In fact, it states that their slight 4% YoY increase in net revenue income was driven by the fact that the US had a more favorable interest rate environment during that year, and their reduction of deposits in Germany, where they were experiencing negative interest rates.

[German Interbank Rates](https://preview.redd.it/48vnrbb8i3u41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a0a59307e28b9d70cd48969d4e17cd9fbdec55a)

Negative interest rates mean that banks need to pay the central bank to safely store their reserves with them, making it really hard to make a profit for banks. Luckily they had the relatively high interest rates of the US to make up for it in 2019. With interest rates cut to 0% again, this will be a very different story for 2020, and they’ll likely see even larger losses for this year.

Balance Sheet (omitted boring parts)

|**Assets**|€ 1.3T |
|:-|:-|
|Cash & Central Bank Deposits|€ 147B|
|Financial Assets|€ 531B (Trading Assets - €110B, **Derivatives with a positive value - € 333B**)|
|Loans|€ 430B|
|**Liabilities**|€ 1.2T|
|Deposits|€ 572B|
|Financial Liabilities|€ 404B (Trading Liabilities - € 37B, **Derivatives with a negative value - € 317B**)|
|Long Term Debt|€ 136B|
|**Equity**|€ 62B|

So there’s a few very interesting things here. First, is the fact that their book value is €62B, or $67B USD, giving them a leverage of 26, which is way higher than literally every bank in the United States.

[Top 100 US banks, sorted by leverage](https://preview.redd.it/h2y0z38bi3u41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=04817dd2930c7c388559b1e904fa5648e7f4cc58)

What does a bank leverage ratio mean? It’s a quick way to see how well capitalized a bank is, and its ability to withstand negative shocks to its balance sheets without becoming insolvent. It’s harder to think of a more severe shock to the economic systems and people’s ability to pay back loans than a complete worldwide lockdown.

Another thing fishy with their book value is that their market cap is sitting at 13B USD. Even in January, before the stock market crashed it was sitting at 17B USD. That’s a big red flag, because theoretically if Deutsche Bank’s assets were all liquidated today, investors should theoretically be left with €62B, or $38 per share, which is way higher than the stock’s current $6 share price. This should especially be easy because the vast majority of their balance sheet consists of liquid assets or assets that should be easy to liquidate… or are they?

**Derivatives**

Let’s take a closer look at their derivatives. In their annual statement, they mentioned that they were trying to discontinue their derivatives business, which already helped cause one banking crisis a decade ago. They restructured and put all their “bad” capital, like their derivatives, in its own entity, called the “Capital Release Unit”, with the goal of liquidating these assets to release capital and de-leverage themselves. In 2019, their Capital Release Unit lost a total of €3.9B and held the €333B of derivatives. It also looks like they’re doing a bad job of releasing this specific class of capital, because their derivative assets and liabilities actually increased since 2018. That’s because a lot of these derivatives are not traded in exchanges, but instead over-the-counter with parties that have an ISDA agreement. As anyone who’s watched The Big Short can tell you (so literally everyone else on this subreddit), these OTC derivatives tend to be illiquid and difficult to value due to lack of price discovery.

This is why Deutsche Bank’s book value is more than their market cap, even before COVID-19. There’s doubt as to what some of the OTC derivatives are actually worth. They have a book value of €62B with derivatives supposedly valued at €333B, meaning if the actual net value of these derivatives are 19% or more lower than what they say they are, they become insolvent. This is the bank equivalent of buying SPY puts on margin in Robinhood (yes I know you can’t do that), but not knowing how much your puts are worth until you try selling. If you were like most of r/wallstreetbets you probably bought SPY puts when SPY was at 220. You know if you tried to sell your puts you might find out that they’re now worth a lot less than you originally bought them for (in the case of OTC derivatives, they can actually have a negative value!), realizing your portfolio value (equity) is below zero and you get a margin call (insolvent). In fact, they’ve [allegedly done something similar in 2008](https://whistleblower.org/in-the-news/financial-times-deutsche-bank-show-of-strength-or-a-fiction/) by failing to recognize losses related to the explosion of super senior tranches of CDOs, which may have led to joining Lehman Brothers in the bank graveyard if they did.

Let’s take a closer look at these derivatives, specifically the ones that mature in 2020.

Derivatives maturing in 2020 by nominal value

|**Type**|**Bilateral**|**Central Counterparty**|**Exchange Traded**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Interest|€2.5T|€8.7T|€4T|
|Currency|€4.3T|€95B|€17B|
|Equity|€98B|0|€184B|
|Credit|€39B|€63B|0|
|Commodity|€2.7B|0|€31.9B|

First a few things to clarify. Bilateral Clearing is an agreement between some party with an ISDA agreement with the bank, where the bank acts as the counterparty to the derivative being sold. Central Counterparty Clearing is when an institution facilitates an OTC derivative transaction by ensuring both sides of the transaction are financially sound enough and have enough collateral to not default on the derivative, and if any party defaults on the derivative, the central counterparty is now financially responsible for their side of the trade. This was put into place after 2008 when the risk of counterparties like AIG defaulting on credit default swaps became a huge systematic problem.

Also, a nominal value is different from a derivative’s actual price. For example, if you bought a SPY 4/20 220p, the nominal value of your derivative is $22000 (100 shares \* $220 per share) but the actual value of your put is $0.

We know that since Dec 2019

* Interest rates got cut all around the world
* Currencies exchange rates have dramatically changed since December with oil-exporting countries. For example USD / CAD went from $1.30 to $1.42 during this time period
* Equity values exploded, even with the bull run we’re currently in
* A lot of BBB-rated companies got downgraded, and we might see defaults come in, even with the Fed buying bonds
* Oil is fucked

These recent events will probably change the valuation of these derivatives by a lot, some of which are going to be realized on their balance sheets immediately (eg. exchange traded derivatives) because their valuations can easily be calculated. The key here is that the net losses needs to be below €62B or they become insolvent.

Now, we’re in the age of too-big-to-fail businesses and the US government and Fed bailing out everyone, which is a real risk of taking a short position against $DB, especially considering how connected they are with other US financial institutions by acting as the counterparty or the central counterparty clearing house to many derivatives that they hold. If Deutsche Bank goes under, a lot of other financial institutions are going to have problems. The problem with Deutsche Bank is that it is not a US company and can’t be hence bailed out by the US government. In fact, they weren’t eligible for TARP, the last government-funded bank bailout back in 2008, which is partially why they’ve been a financial mess ever since.

Their Q1 earnings call is on April 29, so we’ll find out how much trouble they are then.

I'm back with another analysis since some posts about PCG had recently caught my eye. This isn't necessarily a trade to play, but to clarify some on the confusion right now. I'm seeing a lot of people say ""buy poots, bearish bet!"" without looking at the level 2 information. So in the interest of saving ya'll tendies, I'm making this post.

**TL,DR:** No positions, but read the whole post, it's better to stay informed and learn a little bit so you don't YOLO your savings into doing the opposite of what institutional investors are doing.

&#x200B;

**Options Activity**

Today was HUGE in terms of PCG options activity. 2 49,501 option blocks were traded at the same time, 49,501 9/18 5p and 49,501 6/19 6p. This sets up a debit spread that represents > 9,000,000 shares , which is almost TWICE of today's total daily volume. This is an astronomical bet by an institution, with a net debit of $3,465,070.

Now the really interesting thing about this trade is that it isn't a straight debit spread. It's actually something called a [""Diagonal Put Spread,""](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/put-backspread/#subnav-all-plays-skill) sort of a cross between a long put calendar spread and a short put spread. This is 100% **NOT A BEARISH BET.** Diagonal put spreads are generally a market neutral play, in which you purchase a OTM closer (front month) put and sell a further OTM and longer expiration (back month) put. Once the front month put expires, the institution will usually sell another block of puts at the same expiration and strike as the back month put. This means the institution is playing theta gang until June, by which point it will switch to a short put spread, becoming *bullish.*

&#x200B;

**Fundamentals**

PCG, or Pacific Gas and Electric Company, has been faced with a slew of controversy as of late. Its CEO has just announced that he would be stepping down on June 30th. June 30th also happens to be PCG's reorganization plan deadline before its bankruptcy proceedings. A lot of catalysts happening within a few months and the stock price has been volatile, hovering around the 7-16 range for the past few months. The general consensus is that the stock will fall, but remember, just like in my SNAP play if you follow consensus you will almost always be wrong. When companies file for bankruptcy, the stock price doesn't necessarily go down, rather the price action of PCG will be determined by the circumstances of its restructuring plan, which may actually turn out to be beneficial to shareholders.

&#x200B;

**What the Institution is Betting on**

The institution that initiated this trade is betting that the stock will stay neutral until June, by which point once the restructuring details are released will begin to climb again. A possible explanation is that the institution knows exactly what the restructuring details are, and is planning to squeeze out as much profit via theta from dumbass put holders like us, and make out like bandits for the eventual price rise.

&#x200B;

**Why I might be wrong, Conclusion**

The one major issue I have with forecasting the price of PCG is just the sheer amount of option open interest on all monthly contracts for PCG. There's so much noise that I cannot make a clear determination of what the big boys are playing. However, in my opinion, based on what this particular institution is doing, I do not expect PCG to go lower than $8 anytime soon, and even expect a price rise come June. Don't buy puts, and as always, do your own DD and stay hungry.

This is the bear case I am writing out going forward past this earning season. The TL:DR is at the bottom for strikes and dates.  


So - let's pretend none of us are epidemiologists and none of us know what the fuck a R factor is or any of that ""mathlete not an athlete"" shit is. We only have the data at this point in time looking backwards, and we are going to extrapolate looking  forwards based on policy thus far.  


 Let's get an understanding first of where we are in terms of price. Even ol' Warren B (B-W skillet, as it was), will tell you that the most important thing about buying an asset is what price you pay. At the top of the market we were around \~18-21 P/E ratio for the S&P. That is SPY 330. Now before all of you tune out, especially some of the smarter commentators, I am only pointing this out in super vague terms. I understand you can fuck this number with valuations to the point where it's absolutely meaningless ( Looking at you Dominoes pizza you fucking whore. GO DOWN ON ME. GO DOWNNN).  


Now, let's bring the argument to where we are today. No-one is consuming like they were even 2 months ago. That's fine you might say, markets are forward looking. That is TRUE. The markets are not omniscient, and are mostly random static noise. It's like the temperature today, you couldn't have predicted it a year ago, but if you use weather models you know it's going to most likely fall within 1 or 2 standard deviations of historical models. That's fair.  


Ok, so we are in the midst of a pretty dismal earning seasons, but nothing is really moving. That's fine - and it makes sense. The market doesn't behave like some drunk driver swerving at the last moment to miss the old lady and hit the barrier. It's forward looking - i.e. it crushes that old lady like a baby being born in the squat position on a concrete floor. So right now, we have on the P/E value (it doesn't matter what the absolute value is) on the SPY saying we are only \~17% below the highs. That's fine, it's baking in some profit later, pre-empting the concrete hiccup that is the sordid tragedy of your 4/24 puts.

Now you know where I am coming from in terms of 'historical' prices. You were happy to buy at ""X"" p/e (feb 21st 2020), so if things return to normal within say, 5 months you should be very comfortable buying at  X-17%, knowing that discount will evaporate over time. Especially if your one of those dollar cost averages over time folk, you should be quite content.  


However, there are two things that should be clawing at the back of your mind. The first  -   


1) if things(economy) are opening up, why is gold still going up, but the 10 year treasury is still around \~.6%, and stocks are going up? There is a dichotomy of truth happening here, but more on that in a bit.  
2) If no-one is spending money, then PRESENT topline revenue is taking a massive hit. So the valuations at the present day (i.e. what you are looking at) are future forward looking. They are discounting this virus as something like a service interruption, not a paradigm shift.    


Ok I got this far, and I realized how far down the rabbit hole I was. There will be a series of like 15 links at the bottom if you want to read further about how I came to my conclusions. For the 5 of you who will actually read it, let's just DM and discuss.  


  
So here we are, opening the US and at max optimism. What I'm about to tell you next is 100% contrarian, and has to do with ONLY how many folk have been infected. So. The US has 350 million or something people. They've tested  some X amount of folk, with 800K infected.  


 [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-cases-are-likely-10-to-20-times-higher-in-us-than-reported-former-fda-chief-gottlieb-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-cases-are-likely-10-to-20-times-higher-in-us-than-reported-former-fda-chief-gottlieb-says.html)   


Now. Let's suppose the even highest limit of this estimate was true. If 8-16 million people have already had this virus and the death rates are what they are - that would mean to reach a herd immunity of 60% of the population you would also need to multiply the current death toll (at the finality of the virus) by a multiple of 10/20 times. Do you honestly think policy makers will let that happen? OR do you think it's reasonable these shutdowns continue for a SECOND time, crushing the optimism in the market. With a three week incubation time, look for logarithmic progress in the virus say two weeks after lockdowns end.  


TL:DR; CDC/WHO don't make shit up, virus causes second lockdown by July 13th due to re-infection of remaining populace (it won't be July 4th for obvious reasons) - but it will be clear by then where we are at. Markets haven't priced this in.  SPY 235 08/10.",2020-04-23 06:19:46,-0.9886,-0.9993,-0.12961095238095235,-0.7058369841269841

&#x200B;

So low low volume all day, and giant 10 minute sell off at the end there today. Like seriously, jump on the 5 minute chart and look at the daily volume. The sell off continued well into the after market as well, although I see a good bit of a 830pm-930pm reversal happening right now, back slightly above the bottom of the end of day bar's bottom. What we can infer by today's lack of volume, is that less people are sure of what is what right now, same as we have been, but with how easily end of day fell, I'm inclined to bias bearishly. I think we may see conservative gains, like we did all day, but one good plunge starts the show. I'd be very careful holding calls or stocks right now unless you  have stops in place. 

&#x200B;

No major fundamentals had large changes today. We continued to see oil be wonky, and june contracts are a bit up in the air value wise as well. If oil sustains a few months like this, dominoes start to roll for sure. Interesting that Russia stated it was waiting to see what opec does before it does anything. Housing saw a bit of a bump for mortgage service/creation companies, in that Fannie and Freddie will now buy mortgages where borrowers deferred their first payments. Prior to this change, any new borrowers who didn't pay their first bill because uncle sam said so, well they had their mortgages kept entirely by the loan servicer (which was not the plan, to be clear, these loans are most frequently passed off to Uncle Sam), and the loan servicer is frequently not in the business of owning such things and might be quickly overwhelmed by their new found debt levels. Freddie and Fannie taking these loans will literally save good amount of mortgage companies weighed down by this. 

Jobs reports will be awful, but 'down' in face value only, so expect people to once again not care, or even potentially discover arithmetic and notice that last week was 6 and this week is 4, so jobs are going up! even..though..thats.. Nevermind. 

&#x200B;

For now, continue your straddles, be very cautious of your calls  and be hopeful for your puts. I would start to feel comfortable leaning heavily into your downs, especially if you break a support or fall under current trends. Remember, downs are far more explosive than ups. This is still a bearish sign, because it is essentially a failed 'up' day. As always, however, use your stops. If our fall takes another week to start, don't go broke on Friday.

This fake vaccine company that already applied for $400 million shelf is sky rocketing off news that they started “testing”. They have never released a product fucking ever, or completed testing a vaccine ever. They claim they are working on a vaccine for every fucking outbreak, this time they had the vaccine “three hours” after the first confirmed US case. 

Yea fuck off.

Make sure you weed through all the twitter garbage. Look at their earnings report, and look at their other vaccine schedules etc. There are tons of lawsuits against them right now. They are the definition of a pump and dump company, it’s literally all they do.

They lied about why bill gates gave them a donation.
They also announced the donation the morning of earnings.
Before that they had a huge announcement two days before their internal RSU stock bonuses became sellable. (Citron Research killed it the same day from 14 down to like 7)

Then go back in time further, pretty much same announcements word for word for every vaccine they ever claimed to create. Almost like they reused then.

Here is a collection of proof, this is just the surface. Go down the rabbit hole:

* Earnings 5/05 (right?)
* One by one tech is hitting or surpassing ATH
* Everyone is FOMO'ing about the tech gains
* Analysts claiming tech is recession proof
* This is obviously a continually growing market with or without covid

I'm not saying it's a sure thing, but I'll take any bet that's over 50/50. I have 90 5/15cs since I plan to sell above ATH but obviously I don't know what's gonna happen so don't copy me blindly.

861,Discussion,Top options trading mistakes that you should not make,3616,g6agbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6agbg/top_options_trading_mistakes_that_you_should_not/,370,1587621769.0,"This is my post on wsbelite. Repost here for all.

IMO, trading options have similarities to playing poker and in order to be successful in the long run you need to be disciplined and refrain from making common mistakes. I’m going to list common mistakes and some tips here. Please suggest more. Hope we all lose less tendies!

1. Refrain to trade low volume options . These contracts will have really wild bid/ask spread, or really low volume, which reduces your chance to make profit significantly. For example how can you win if you trade $ROPE 100c when the bid ask spread is $69/$96 per contract?
2. Refrain to trade very low price options (e.g 1-10 cents) because your broker commissions will eat up a significant amount of the transactions. Think how much commissions you have to pay to buy 10000 contracts of 0.01 $ROPE 1000c which costs $10000 of premium.
3. Refrain to buy near-dated far OTM options, because this is almost a sure way to burn your money. Even worse, even if you guess the direction right, you may still have a substantial loss. Think $PEI 500% OTM 2DTE. Btw $PEI is a great stock to own. Example: on 04/13 you bought SPY 496c 04/17 when SPY=280. On 04/14 SPY rises to 285. Guess how much you made on your call options?
4. Know when to select OTM vs ITM options: in general: OTM is higher risk/higher return. Have some sense of OTM price movement - even when you guess the direction right, far OTM options won’t make you money because of low delta. ITM is more expensive. ATM is typically a safe choice if you just want to make a directional bet.
5. Know theta-crush. Your options will lose time-value every day, so refrain from buying short-dated options unless you know what you're doing.
6. Know the effects of IV (VIX for SPY) on options price. Sometimes even when you guess the direction rights, you may lose money because of VIX movements. Know how to hedge for VIX movement.
7. Refrain from using market orders when possible: limit orders will give you the price you want.
8. Understand the margin impact of different options strategies.
9. Understand the impact of your broker commissions.
10. Bank management: never YOLO your entire portfolio into one position, because if you lose, there’s 0% chance to make it back. Learn [http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/](http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/). If you want to get in a large (50K+) position, average in/out may be a good idea.
11. Don't open too many positions unless you're a bot. It's hard to manage manually and easy to make mistakes.
12. (Mostly) don't follow autist DDs that you can't explain.
13. Learn the market hours!
14. Options strategies can be complex to visualized. Use your broker's performance profile tool to understand the performance implications before making a trade.

**Some risky options strategies that you should only do when you know what you’re doing**

* Naked puts, i.e. short puts: very risky especially in a recession: when the underlying crashes you’ll lose lots of money
* Synthetic shorts: i.e. long puts + sell calls, also very risky, only know when you’re 90% sure of the direction.
* Naked calls, i.e. short calls: also pretty risky if the underlying moons.
* …

**Less risky options strategies:**

1. Covered calls: very low risk. You hold shares, and sell OTM calls to cover them and collect the premium.
2. Cash secured puts: sell puts but you have cash to cover it. This is good when you’re willing to buy the shares if it drops, otherwise you collect the premium.
3. Diagonal: Simultaneously entering into a long and short position in two options of the same type (two call options or two put options) but with different strike prices and different expiration dates. Typically these structures are on a 1 x 1 ratio. This is less risky and can hedge you against IV as well. For example if you bearish on USO, buy a 4p 05/15 and sell a 3.5p 04/24, that way if USO moves upward on the week ending 04/24 you’ll collect the near-dated premium.
4. Learn how to sell options. Every mistake you made as an option buyer is probably a chance for you to profit as an option-seller.

**Practical tips**

1. Use tools to scan top volume options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders) . This can give you some confirmation.
2. Use tools to scan unusual activity options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity) Try to think why people are making that trade. Your broker also has tools to scan these.
3. Take advantage of L2 flow data if your broker provides.
4. Sometime when you can't make a long-term directional bet, it may be profitable to day-trade or swing-trade (hold your positions for 1-3 days).
5. Know common ETFs:

* SPY: everyone knows this. The most liquid options to trade.
* IWM: tracks Russell 2000. Also pretty liquid. Trade this if you don't want expose to big techs.
* Sector specific ETFs: XLE, XLF, XLC, etc. Also highly liquid.
* Country specific ETFs: EWU, EWG, EWC, EWA, EWJ ... fairly liquid.
* Gold: GLD
* Silver: SLV
* Oil: USO (make sure you really understand this; it doesn't track oil price)
* Options of individual stocks: in general, the more liquid the underlying, the more liquid the options, e.g. AMZN, BA, FB, TSLA, ...

**Tips to improve**

Learn more about economics and business to improve your common sense.

Advanced topics: understand how MM works, gamma hedging, dark pool indicators, probably understand some TAs such as RSI.

Day trade dynamics: power hours.

**Things to debate**

1. Should you use stop-loss orders or not?
2. When to buy FDs and how much should you spend on FDs?
3. What is the impact of the underlying delisted on put options? As example OILU closed on 03/29 [https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/MC3724/20200316/SUP\_421079.PDF](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/MC3724/20200316/SUP_421079.PDF)

* On March 15, 2020 ProShares Capital Management LLC announced that it plans to close and liquidate ProShares UltraPro 3x Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILU) and ProShares UltraPro 3x Short Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILD). Each fund trades on NYSE Arca. The last day the funds will accept creation orders is March 27, 2020. Trading in each Fund will be suspended prior to market open on March 30, 2020. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about April 3, 2020 (the “Distribution Date”).
* Shareholders may sell their shares of a Fund (subject to any applicable brokerage or transaction costs) until the market close on March 27, 2020. From March 30, 2020 through the Distribution Date, shares of the Funds will not be traded on NYSE Arca and there will not be a secondary market for the shares. During this period, each Fund will be in the process of liquidating its portfolio and will not be managed in accordance with its investment objective.
* These strategies are intended to allow an Oil Fund to preserve a minimal portion of its value in the event of significant adverse movements in a Fund’s benchmark. There can be no guarantee that an Oil Fund will be able to implement such strategies or that such strategies will be successful. Each Oil Fund will incur additional, potentially substantial, costs as a result of such strategies which may cause or increase tracking error and would be expected to have a substantial adverse impact on performance. Use of such strategies would cause an Oil Fund to not perform consistent with its investment objective. Furthermore, in the event that an Oil Fund’s value decreases by 70% or more at any point from its prior day’s NAV, as determined by the Sponsor, the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, in order to maintain the integrity of the ongoing operation of the Fund or for other reasons, may cause such Fund to liquidate some or all of its positions and, in lieu of such positions, invest such assets in cash or money market instruments. The above actions may be taken without prior notification to shareholders and would be expected to cause an Oil Fund not to perform consistent with its investment objective. Under these circumstances, consistent with its general authority, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, cause an Oil Fund to be terminated and dissolved.",2020-04-23 02:02:49,0.9984,-0.1779,0.1658524676233812,0.3287841558744604

This is for 4/21-4/22. I’m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

&#x200B;

I've got a lot for you today so let's get into it. First is my favorite play for this post. 

&#x200B;

**ATVI;** So somebody brought this Activision (ATVI) play to my attention so I [checked out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g542sx/activision_is_going_to_smash_83_and_hit_new_ath/) and did a little research. With the immense popularity of their game Warzone and a player base that has nearly doubled because of the quarantine, ATVI is set to crush earnings. Warzone is a free game however they have a battle pass and cosmetic items that can be paid for with real money. Free games with optional purchases make bank. Just look at Fortnite which became a multi-million dollar game over the course of a couple of months. With Warzone and the Modern Warfare games skyrocketing in popularity, ATVI is a safe bet for an earnings play. It also has been fairly ignored. Quarantine stocks are hot right now with Netflix, Amazon, Shopify, etc. all skyrocketing. What isn't skyrocketing is the gaming industry which is set to make just as much from everyone being inside. EA, Activision, Take-Two Interactive, and other gaming companies will make on this so we need to get in on it before the rest of the market catches on and drives premiums up. I got a 5/8 $79c for .40 today. Jump in before it's too late. Activision reports earnings 5/5 which means anything after that is a good bet. 

&#x200B;

**SQ;** Square (SQ) is a very good bet if you want puts. Square Revenue for 2019 was $4,472,473 USA and $241,027 International (thousands). This means that the US is the primary location for sales clearly. The US is also locked down. Small businesses are the primary sellers and are,

>""disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns and may fail at a higher rate than larger or more established businesses”

according to a statement made by Square themselves. Sure some small businesses can sell online but square processes by swipes so even if they are selling online Square themselves aren't getting anything. Here's what you can take away from this; SQ WILL LOSE MONEY BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN. That's just what is going to happen. This is compounded by the fact that they pay their debt based on their swipes processed so it's just gonna stay stagnant and generate interest for a couple of months. Take into account that a lot of small businesses are going to fail and you have a recipe to make money on puts here. [OP of the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5vd6p/square_inc_sq_puts_lets_be_rational/) says $50p 6/19 but from the looks of it, they are gonna drop before that. Earnings are on 5/6 so 5/8 and after is smart for puts. 

&#x200B;

**TSN;** [This post gets into](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5h736/tyson_getting_butchered/) the details surrounding Tyson (TSN) and the amount of trouble they are in. Their plants seem to be a hot spot for the Beer Flu. Places like Council Bluffs near Omaha NE, Perry IA, Waterloo IA, Logansport IN, and Sioux City IA are all getting slammed with cases while Tyson hides from the media. Their price is going to tank. This isn't even taking into account the immense drop in demand for meat nations worldwide. They aren't even shutting down the plants yet and one of their employees just died. [According to this post](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g59pwp/rfarming_says_us_meat_production_is_screwed/), COVID19 is wreaking havoc on meat processing plants causing oversupply to the point of farmers facing the decision to ""dispose"" of animals or sell at a loss. Get puts for a little bit out and watch Tyson drop like a stone. 

&#x200B;

This is getting really long already so I'm not going to do a write up about Wayfair (W) just [check out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5nzid/furniture_its_that_thing_youre_sitting_on/) and remember that it is also an online shopping company and a lot of people are sitting at home wishing they had different furniture. One more thing, u/fuzzyblankeet, where you at my man? I miss you out here in the land of fucking retards. It’s a dark place without your beautiful essays on how not to be a dumb stupid idiot.

878,DD,Quick USO Update - Quantifying why it's down today,23,g67lha,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g67lha/quick_uso_update_quantifying_why_its_down_today/,42,1587612429.0,"Hi Ya'll - gonna keep this as quick as possible. USO halted trading briefly today, and some new numbers were published showing what they planned on/ are now holding, and this may clarify for some of you why they are down today:

Previous Price at Close | Previous NAV | Premium
:--:|:--:|:--:
$2.81 | $2.06 | 36%

Uh oh... remember, USO ran out of shares it could issue, and with the retail inflows, there was a pressure on the share price to rise and dislocate from the underlying assets -> hence, 36% premium at yesterday's price at close.

What happened today (Will be confirmed after close):


Contracts (Month) | % Holding, Open | % Holding, 2:35PM | Weighted Average, Open | Weighted Average, Close
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
June| 20% | 20% | 2.052 | 2.806
July| 80% | 50% | 13.944 | 10.41
August | 0 % | 20% | 0 | 10.737
Sept | 0 % | 5% |0 | 1.2905

Now, if you remember back to highschool, you should be able to do some weighted average calculations to confirm: Since USO rolled forward their contracts, what is the penatly (cost in numebr of contracts held) that they incurred?
Sum weighted previous close: 15.996
Sum weighted 2:35PM : 19.279

Relative number of contracts held: 17% fewer contracts (give or take a few %). This is a reduction in barrels of oil per share of exposure (lower reactivity to future price swings). The second issue, is a reduction in the sensitivity to the spot price, as they are now concentrated so far in the future (lower reactivity to spot price changes). So what do we have? We now have a fund that still has massive structural issues, but probably won't blow up by Friday (unless bigly negative oil). We also ***cannot expect they will ever achieve their highs again due to continued contango, and, even if backwardation were to start tomorrow, they are much worse positioned to benefit from higher oil prices.*** You are looking at a new fund: if you want to invest in it, have an idea of how changes in oil price might impact the fund's performance.... yikes...
 
Using the prices of WTI oil futures at 2:35, I find that the new mix of futures $USO holds have increased 26%. Multiply this increase in value by the NAV at close, and we find $2.58 (2:25PM). Right now, USO is at $2.50, which means the market has reduced the arbitrage opportunity (3.2% premium, down from 36% the day before).

I will check these numbers tonight after market's close, and once the NAV is published. This fund is still int trouble, but taking steps so as not to immediately collapse.

TLDR: 

Previous NAV | Asset % Change| New est. NAV | Current Price
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
$2.06 | 21% | $2.50 | $2.58

Update 1 From prices at close: Still waiting for USCF to post their final numbers

Previous NAV | Asset % Change| New est. NAV | Current Price
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
$2.06 | 22% | $2.51 | $2.51

Edit 1: if there is enough interest, I will post a bit about my calculation for USO to hit by August, assuming their fund structure stays the same, and that the US is able to get oil back up to 30$/barrel. If there is no contango (completely flat) - I am showing 3.71$ - which is obviously not possible, but serves as an upper bound. If we insert a formula to calculate the penalty of rolling contracts in deep contango over, I arrive at $1.76...

Update 2: Finally posted on USCF's website: $2.31/Share NAV. Trading at a premium of 8.6%. Ouch... much worse than I had thought, and this has a lot to do with where their trades settled during the day.

So their DAUs boomed, which we all expect to be true across the board of social media companies (as the others are riding SNAPs coat tails today and all on the rise) because what the fuck else are us retards doing other than scrolling through instagram and adding hot girls in bikinis to our spank banks? But anyway, I digress.

Social media company's earnings are coming up and we can expect one thing- they'll fucking boom, because thats the way it goes, baby. But while Wall Street claims to be forward thinking and stock price is based on perceived future value, blah blah blah, it's clear they haven't thought about what's going to happen when we're all back out of our house and not glued to our phones with our dicks in our hands. 

So, over the next few weeks as these companies report earnings and their stocks continue to pop together, long term puts are going on sale. If you think these social media companies can maintain their Q1 user growth, you're more retarded than I am and I bid you adieu. On top of that, a lot of SME businesses are going bankrupt and not advertising- this will hit Facebook harder than SNAP because, Boomers own those businesses and Boomers only advertise on Facebook. They're all going to suffer though as marketing budgets have already been slashed and it looks like most companies are stocking up for a massive holiday spend to regain losses from early this year because of the beer virus. 

Disclaimer- I have short term calls on these companies too and plan to double down on long puts once they pop off earnings.

# The Past

Hop in my time machreeee and travel with me back in time. The year, 2019. For his podcast ‘How I Built This’, Guy Raz is interviewing Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke and they are talking about the 2008 crash. Shopify had been expecting to shutter operations amidst unprecedented economic fallout and dire unemployment numbers, but instead, they found that the surge in unemployment led to people using the extra time on their hands to scratch their entrepreneurial itch. Shopify, in turn, saw record growth.

# The Present

Cut to today, we are looking down the barrel of 22 million unemployment claims over just the past 4 weeks… and it’s going to get worse. What’s coming is an unprecedented spike of unemployed folks looking to embrace their inner Rockefeller. But it’s not just them — it’s Farmer’s Market vendors, traditional B2B businesses, Brick and Mortar retailers, people who are actually creative, and yes, retards like you and me who have turned to a life of drop-shipping N95 masks and toilet paper from that one Chinese company who until last month exclusively manufactured fidget spinners — we’re all looking for avenue’s to keep the monopoly money flowing. 

Heinz — you know, the guys who make the ketchup you fucking nerds put on your scrambled eggs — have been a B2B company since they were founded in 1869. No longer. As of last week, they are selling Direct to Consumer… [using Shopify](https://heinztohome.co.uk/). And any company not run by out-of-touch boomers is following suit.

Total retail sales in the US — 5.46 Trillion in 2019.  That’s a lot of scharole.  And unlike 2008, Shopify now exists all over the fucking world. Their international growth potential is astounding, especially considering that as recently as 2018 the platform was only available in English and a mere 23% of their revenue was outside of Canaduh and The United States of Freedomtown.  Shopify is now in 175 different countries. 1-7-5 — those are nearly coronavirus numbers! This past Thursday, Shopify’s CTO stated that they are [seeing ‘Black Friday level traffic everyday’](https://twitter.com/jmwind/status/1250816681024331777). 

They clear a monthly fee for each storefront, they are pulling down payment processing fees, fulfillment fees, and then they have their competitive moat… an entire app ecosystem so that you can pimp out your storefront like Xzibit. These guys could give jpow’s printer a run for its money.  JK — not, fucking, possible. 

# The Competition

**[Etsy](https://www.etsy.com):** Whereas Shopify offers a dynamic eCommerce platform, Etsy caters to handmade and artisanal products, and takes a cut of product sales and charges to list products.  They’re like Shopify’s free-spirited, crystal-infused, nudist younger brother. Shopify stands to capture much more market share due to the disruption of traditional retail, but Etsy should still see some growth as the creatives go to the platform to subsidize their Trump bucks.  If $SHOP is too rich for your blood, I think $ETSY, currently 15% off their 52-week high, also has positive prospects. That said, they come with a MUCH lower ceiling. 

**[Magento](https://magento.com/):** Adobe bought Shopify’s largest competitor, Magento, in 2018. It’s more flexible than Shopify, BUT it caters towards larger stores, is self-hosted, and requires a lot more upfront effort to get up and running. Because of the higher barrier to entry, and the fact that people are lazy bastards, I believe Shopify will capture the vast majority of new eCommerce adopters.

**[Square](https://squareup.com/us/en):** Square’s bread and butter are brick and mortar retailers. They thrive on storefront business.  In 2018 they acquired Weebly, signaling a break into the eCommerce space. And then, in 2019, they introduced their online store-front alternative, ‘Square Online Store’. While they get a 0 on the innovative name game, I do think they will capture a chunk of brick and mortar retailers who already use their service for in-person purchases, but their solution appears to be much less dynamic than Shopify’s offering. I think they are overexposed to the traditional retail pullback, though their eCommerce solution should ensure they won’t go down as hard as your mom did last weekend.

**[Market Fundamentals](https://www.federalreserve.gov/):** General consensus around here is that this recovery defies reason and I tend to agree. You don’t lose a quarters-worth of production, growth, and sales and keep on chugging along as if nothing happened. Eventually, the recovery gravy train we’ve witnessed these last few weeks could come tumbling down. It’s important to keep this ever-present risk in mind. Plus, now that a Mad Max future is out the window with unlimited cheap oil, who knows what nightmarish future we are marching into.

# The Future
With a barrier to entry of just $29 bucks a month and easy, code-free setup, Shopify is the no-brainer platform of choice for aspiring robber barons in the impending post-apocalyptic dystopia that awaits us all. Yes, Shopify’s P/E ratio is pretty fucking absurd. But you know what? When Amazon was preparing for world domination, it was expensive too, and now it’s a motherfuckin meme stock with a 1.2 trillion dollar market cap.  Shopify may be caressing all-time highs, but they’ve been at or near ‘all-time highs’ at pretty much any given date going back the past 4 years. Shopify has no debt and 2.4 billion in cash stuffed into their mattresses. It goes without saying that they are prepared for those depression era bread lines. Earnings are 5/06. I think 730 is a reasonable goal. People are stuck at home, bored as fuck or dying of the ‘rona, what else are they doing if not buying dumb shit online. At the very least we’re going to be seeing a massive spike in subscriptions as well as a host of big-name brands transitioning to the platform. 

We are seeing a monumental shift not just in retail, but in how we fundamentally live. I believe Shopify is positioned for this long term. With a market cap of $70 billion, I’m bullish on Shopify’s prospects over the next few years thanks to the extraordinary circumstances and extraordinary times we are living in. I also suspect that we will see a further spike in the short term, as people come to terms with the pivotal role Shopify is going to be playing in the future of eCommerce. 

So what do you do with this information?

The answer is simple… open your own Shopify store and start selling Depends.

Article text: 

""Monday’s plunge in U.S. crude futures into negative territory has raised an obvious question in the oil market: can the global Brent marker do the same?

The answer is yes.

ICE Futures Europe Ltd. confirmed on Tuesday night that it’s preparing various Brent prices for just that possibility if there’s demand to do so -- even if there’s still a long way to go before that happens, since June contracts are trading at about $20 a barrel. Beyond the mechanistic side of negative pricing there’s also market reality: the world’s storage sites are filling with crude fast -- the precise concern that caused West Texas Intermediate to turn negative.

“In the North Sea, the ships operate as a pipeline, so are there enough vessels to enable the flow of oil?” said Jorge Montepeque, president of General Index and the man who helped shape the way oil prices are assessed globally when he was a boss at S&P Global Platts. “If there isn’t, you will need to pay ever increasing prices for the ships, which results in a lower and lower price of the oil.”

That pressure on the tanker fleet is building right now. Well over 100 million barrels of oil is now being held in floating storage -- by another estimate more than twice that. According to Belgian vessel owner Euronav NV, one of the world’s largest, the dynamic is driving freight rates ever higher -- a trend the firm doesn’t see reversing any time soon.

Places to keep supplies are diminishing globally. With on-land sites either completely booked up or filling fast, there’s still pressure on Brent, even if it’s more dispersed than for WTI. Barrels may keep flowing for longer than they should, too, because stopping and starting wells is no easy task.

“If there is a technical reason why you cannot shut in the well, then the oil production that you have to sell will have to clear in the market, which can be a negative price,” Montepeque said.

There’s another important difference between the two contracts. While the Brent futures contract is cash settled against the value of the Brent index price, the WTI contract is physically settled, meaning a trader must take delivery of barrels of oil at Cushing in Oklahoma, hundreds of miles from the coast.

While this means that WTI can become pressured if there’s perceived strain on storage at the U.S. hub, there’s also a fast-building glut in the rest of the world.

So Brent can, in theory at least, go negative. The real question is whether production will be scaled back sufficiently before that possibility becomes a probability""",2020-04-22 19:48:31,-0.9714,-0.3818,0.0,-0.45106666666666667

**What $USO Is and Isn't**

United States Oil is not a bet on the price of oil, just like VIX ETFs (UVXY, TVIX) are not bets on the spot price of VIX. It's a bet on the yield of rolling 1-month oil futures into the next month. Up until today, the fund held the vast majority of its assets in front month futures - it held around *25% of all oil futures contracts for May* prior to the spectacular blow-up in that market. It now holds over 25% of June's contracts.

Along with other speculators, $USO cannot actually take physical delivery of this oil. It is thus forced to sell and roll those contracts every month to get them off its books. This makes it a shitty buy-and-hold vehicle at any time, but these are *special times*.

**The Fundamentals**

Everyone knows that the oil market is fucked. No travel and (next to) no economy means (next to) no oil consumption. Along with the Saudi-Russian price war, this has caused a massive glut of production that needs to be [stored somewhere](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/19/supertankers-drafted-in-to-store-glut-of-crude-oil-coronavirus). These oil futures are based on delivery to a specific place with *limited storage capacity*: [Cushing, Oklahoma](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/4/20/5006891-15874130798551934_origin.png). The oil storage problem is [not getting better](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4338817-uso-go-under-2-in-next-3-weeks) and certainly isn't going to evaporate in a few weeks when $USO next needs to roll contracts.

When speculators and ETFs like $USO sell contracts, they need someone who can actually receive and store the crude oil to buy them. May was a spectacular blow-up for a variety of reasons, including non-fundamentals-related front-running of contract rebalancing (this is a problem with many products). But one crucial reason was the need to dump a full quarter of all futures contracts in a few days onto limited storage/reception capacity and the fact that no one is fucking buying oil. Hence the insane selling even in negative territory - if you can't store, you can't buy contracts at/near settlement.

**$USO ""Restructuring"" and the Contango Shitshow**

$USO's value has declined precipitously along with the collapse of oil/futures markets. Its underlying assets (futures contracts and some Treasury hedges) have dropped in value from $13 a share in January to $2 a share now. $USO has decided to ""fix"" its exposure and contract rolling problem by spreading itself out into July and August contracts. It now ""only"" holds [55% of its assets in June contracts](http://www.uscfinvestments.com/holdings/uso). It can also [no longer create new shares](https://www.streetinsider.com/Commodities/United+States+Oil+Fund+%28USO%29+says+USCF+management+is+suspending+ability+of+USO+Authorized+Purchasers+to+purchase+new+creation+baskets/16765783.html) to draw in capital from dumb retail bagholders (you) and is thus trading as a closed-end fund.

Oil futures are still in deep fucking contango - which means later month futures are trading way higher than closer months. Makes sense, right? What doesn't make sense is investing in a product that has to sell those dirt cheap front month contracts to buy more expensive contracts *every fucking month*. June contracts will need to be rolled in early May. Who is going to buy and store all that oil? No one! $USO still needs to dump $1.6 billion in June futures (read: your money) to get out of this mess, and that's at a price of $11.57 per contract. If those contracts go to zero again, that's the majority of the fund's remaining assets gone. Zilch. And if they go negative? The ETF will be on the hook for those losses.

$USO is currently trading at \~$2.74 after hours while the value of underlying assets per share (NAV) is $2.06. That's a 33% premium based on retail idiocy! The fund is going to liquidate just like $OIL, soon, and its value could be completely obliterated in the process. No one holds the bag like retail and pensions. Get the fuck out while you still can.

**tl;dr: USO $2.5p 5/29, or USO $1p 5/29 if you're a big baller who thinks this is going to zero and loves risk**

**Update 5/3: USO has successfully transitioned their structure to be far more reliant on the July contract (2-month, not front month) and spread the rest out across many months. It will continue to slowly bleed value through roll decay, but it is much less likely to implode unless July contacts spike at the same time as the June contracts. This is very dry unlikely to happen, as July contract holders will not be forced sellers until delivery. Exit your puts unless they are very long and were purchased at low IV!**",2020-04-22 18:30:47,1.0,0.0,0.17963757961783436,0.39321252653927813

* Disney has their 2nd quarter earnings on May 5th. Which which wont be great but will show there are well over [50 million subscribers to Disney+](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-hits-50-million-subscribers-disney-says-1234575130/). Which is about a 25 million subscriber jump in 2 months. The initial projections were 60-90 million for the year so this is actually bat shit crazy.

* Florida is going to reopen. For better or worse the Governor is going to make this happen. He has created a ""task-force"" to reopen the states businesses and [Josh D’Amaro, president of the Walt Disney World Resort](https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2020/04/21/meet-the-people-who-will-help-gov-desantis-decide-how-to-re-open-florida-for-business/) is on the board. The Governor will announce with the task-force a reopening strategy on Friday. Once Disney reopens all the Florida mans are gonna go apeshit. 

* [theme parks are still accepting reservations and bookings for June 1st](https://www.foxnews.com/travel/coronavirus-closures-disney-resorts-bookings-june-1). This has to be the biggest aspect of it all. They are anticipating a reopening by at least June AND they are one of the businesses in charge of reopening the state. 

tldr: Floridaman is going to announce reopening the state on Friday with advice from Disney and other major business owners that want the state open again. The parks are still allowing and promoting bookings for June 1st. Disney+ has blown subscriber expectations out of the water. Don't fight the mouse.

I want you to think of each trading day, green or red, as heads or tails.  Despite the 50/50 chance, you could flip and get heads 4 times in a row.  That 5th flip, it's still 50/50 heads or tails.  Each market day isn't much different, at a micro level, the normies of the world are caught in the wash.

Extend the analogy.  If I flip the coin millions of times, I'll normalize closer to that 50/50 probability.  I want you to think of that normalization as your broad macro view on where things are going.  Despite the individual days acting erratic, landing heads or tails numerous times in a row, defying logic, over time, that normalization will still occur.  Don't get caught in the daily wash, trust and play your vibe.

# ""Hey, um, dog ate my playbook, got another copy?""

No, your playbook is your own.  I don't know your vibe.  I can tell you mine.

The market is going down over the long term, bigly down.  We're in economic turmoil, the FED and other bodies are doing all they can to avoid calamity and depression.  I don't believe calamity strikes fully, so if you're looking for ""new global currency"" or other doomsday scenario's, you wont find them here.  Rather, at it's core, my macro vibe says:

>We were in a bubble as we entered 2020, propped up by corporate buybacks inflating the value of the indexes, coincidentally, also at the end of a long and successful bull run.  COVID acted as a catalyst, it put a hurt on cash flow, it ripped the buybacks out while cratering consumer confidence, exploding unemployment, etc.  The end result will be a multi-year recessionary environment, a slow stabilization of main-street, and an eventual re-inflating bubble.

**When does that downturn start?**  I think it already has.  How quick it goes, that takes us back to flipping coins.  The key for me is a camel, and straw.  Put a piece of straw on a camel's back and it yawns, put enough of it, and it collapses.  Right now, it's all about straw.  Bulls are trying to eat it off the camel's back (FED liquidity, Small Business Loans, Re-Opening States, Treatments, Vaccines, etc.) while Bears are trying to pile it on (Unemployment, Lockdown Extensions, Resurgence, Oil Markets, etc.).

I think the Bulls are getting full, and the Bears have a lot of straw left.  I think the Bulls put a poison pill in the stimulus to the tune of $600 extra for unemployment, a pill now swallowed that ensures unemployment only gets worse and worse, as out of touch politicians failed to realize the massive incentive given to half of America to remain unemployed.

We're restless, protesting, going shopping, opening beaches, all at the peak of infection.  Our curve will flatten, but it will not taper in the manner expected.  Sports will reopen, without fans.  Businesses will adapt, but many will go belly up.  Jobs will come back, but not for a long time.  There is lasting damage here, and the market is forward looking, it will see that winter looks awful and 2021 brings more pain.  As that straw piles, the market will break it's own back once probability sets in that we're not in for a strong Q3 recovery.

SPY come 4/22/2021 will be **below** where we sit today, it won't be close.

# ""Sure, market down, got it.  What to I buy?""

Don't flip coins.  Play your vibe.  Entering a recession.  Expect a near term large move down.  Expect minor rebounds.  Expect a drawn out year long decline to the final bottom.  That near term large movement is what you want to play.  SPY puts here we come.

Walking the stairs, head and shoulders.

[https:\/\/www.tradingview.com\/chart\/SPY\/aa3ZSLOt-Head-and-Shoulder-Formation-on-SPY\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/1a77cb69qcu41.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=95ea316446aa8fca6eaa304dfb1f48a5a992f2c6)

Expect a retrace to set the right shoulder.  Should start soon, probably today, should climb towards 282.  If we break 282-284, **I'll exit**, as my vibe turned to shit and I will need to reset my macro expectations.

Your play is to **start hedging into puts** as we rise.  I'm 25% into puts, 75% in cash currently.  You shouldn't wait for the top, average in as we climb.  You've got to decide how aggressive, or conservative you want to be:

* 5/29 - High risk, highest reward, theta burn if the back doesn't break quickly.  I have a couple, here, plan to exit them on our next leg down and roll out further.
* 6/30 - Medium risk, medium reward, can watch May play.  I have some here too, plan to average down as we build our right shoulder.
* 8/21 or 9/18 - Lower risk, longer timeframe.  As we build our right shoulder, I plan to open some 9/18 positions and continue averaging down as we rise.

As for price.  **Don't YOLO below 220**, that's already high risk enough for entry.  240 is middle of the road.  260 is conservative.  You'll make more at 220, you'll open up more losses too.  **Don't open positions before 5/29** trying to guess the coin flips, theta will burn you, and don't YOLO below 220, the risk is too high.

My crystal ball says we'll bottom below 200, likely below 180, though remember, it'll probably **take us a year** to get there.  Right now, play the drop in front of you, enjoy the ride, and remember:

**GAINS AREN'T GAINS UNTIL YOU SELL**

# Updates:

4/22 @ 10:40 /u/PhillyEagless posted this and in a height of lazyness, felt relevant.  I averaged down my 6/30 position, plan to continue to.  Waiting to open 9/18.

https://preview.redd.it/n2qpy4m5udu41.png?width=1541&format=png&auto=webp&s=2439310479800014aa2129c9b46cbca318fd87e9

4/22 @ 2:47 I've added 6/30 at 4.39 and 3.99.  Position down 17.5% thus far.  Am now 50% in, 50% in cash.

4/22 @ 4:00 I tried to open a 9/18 220p position at 3:50, was too conservative.  Had a strike at 8.3, when the green candle opened I saw it push to 8.32, in hindsight I should have aimed at 8.35.  I did try later for 8.4, but wasn't willing to chase too far, it's sitting at 8.73 now.

4/23 @ 8:30 Unemployment claims checked in-line with expectations around 4.4m.  I'm mindful that governmental small business grants that require businesses pay non-working employees to achieve grant status should work to kick many off unemployment, or allow for rejection of claims.  Will be interesting to see how the numbers trend given the additional stimulus in that area should exacerbate the volume of unreported unemployed yet paid workforce.  I think today continues our upward shoulder building, I expect us to push past 280, testing as high as 282.  I get very anxious with any positive test around 282.  Will be looking to put my remaining 50% cash into puts today, aiming for 9/18 and 6/30 positions.  But, that's me guessing at a coin flip.

4/23 @ 11:00 Phew, what a day.  I scaled into 9/18 at 7.95 and 7.69.  I also averaged down my 6/30 with additional buys at 3.44.   I'm now as deployed as I'm going to be, and it feels terrifying.  We punched through 282, there's upside to 285ish.  I have 5/30 positions, if I decide to scale out, that will be the first position I look at either rolling to 6/30, or just cutting all together.  For right now, I'm on the ride, watching where the day goes.  Tonight I'll be reviewing and plotting an exit strategy, stop losses, etc.  Hoping I don't need to use it, still have trust in the vibe, but I'm not here to ride to 0.

4/23 @ 4:00 Well, that was a day.  We ran up to 283, almost tested 284 early on in the day, we seemed to be setting 283 as resistance before Gilead said hold my beer virus and set the algorithms to a 100m volume 5 minute nasty little sell off.  It spooked the market, it reminded how fragile everything sits on the hope of a quick recovery.  I don't know if it's a strong enough catalyst to break the camel's back, but it may set a trend that's hard to recover from.  I am fully in, 5/29 (-46.5%), 6/30 (-12%), and 9/18 (+8.7%) puts.  Holding for now.  ",2020-04-22 15:26:30,-1.0,0.0,-0.3023747399702823,-0.43412491332342745

On top of that, they are doing so with less tools and abilities than other countries.  It has no chance of succeeding, and I will explain why.

**New outbreak in Harbin China:** [https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1186194.shtml](https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1186194.shtml)

Say what you want about China, they are the undisputed gods of contact tracing.  The government presses one button and can see any other person (and their social score) that you've interacted with over X amount of days.  However, even with their level of tracing, one single infection (*who tested NEGATIVE 4 times AND was quarantined 14 days*), started a long chain of community transmission.  

The city now has roadblocks and some are calling it Wuhan 2.0.  How did this happen?  Despite masks, mandatory quarantines, contact tracing, this still resulted in a brand new outbreak.  

**Faulty Testing Equipment at Home:** [https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/21/health/abbott-laboratories-coronavirus-rapid-test/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/21/health/abbott-laboratories-coronavirus-rapid-test/index.html)

The nucleic acid tests in China failed to detect a case in Harbin's patient 0 on 4 attempts.  And that's with the tests working as expected.  Turns out, the tests in the US are being used incorrectly and providing even less accurate results.  

**Contact Tracing / Enforced Quarantines DO NOT EXIST IN USA:** No link, common sense

The US has extremely limited capacity to perform contact tracing.  Wuhan had 10,000+ full time workers purely devoted to contact tracing.  No state has anything comparable, especially states like Georgia and Texas.  Also there's no such thing as mandatory, government-enforced quarantines.  So peeps are definitely sneaking out to grab McDick's and dodge the GrubHub delivery fee.

Long story short the US will fail miserably on a reopening and set the entire country back from the attempt.  Morale will dwindle as it becomes clear that this virus cannot be contained without a massive coordinated effort, and even then there will be setbacks (see Harbin, see Germany, etc.).

During this time their stock had a swing of $.10 in those two days from start to finish. 

They also had their earnings report which surprisingly beat their expected EPS. That’s where their good news ends. They drug in 1 billion in impairment, and has a high debt - equity ratio that is hovering over its head like a storm cloud more than usual in this turbulent time of heavy supply and barely any demand scenario we find ourselves in. Where did a lot of debt come from? From recently bolstering positions to compete with Schlumberger. 

They essentially played their hand right before the beer flu, massing debt at the worst time.

I can’t find any news or anything positive relating to Halliburton anywhere. Their price Target was cut at Cowen, they have massive debt, there is no demand, massive stores and supply issues, they are laying off workers and contractors, going into “hibernation” to survive, this pulling any liquidity they can just to weather the storm, but weathering the storm doesn’t make their current problems dissolve.

Yet somehow they managed to tag along with the rest of the energy sector in this “rally” since Monday and Tuesday’s event. Rising almost 20% in the last two days. Up almost 100% since their March lows.

I understand that the market isn’t acting rationally... but at some point reality has to set in here.

The commerce side is like any grocery store: very low margins so even with incredible volumes they sell margins are still only around 2-3% so how much earnings (not revenue) do you think the last  2 weeks of the quarter will that bring?
Prime memberships offer free shipping, what do you think this means for their cost structure? I pay $120 a year for all prime benefits including free shipping. This means I will buy multiple items because I have free shipping. This is definitely higher than $120 a year worth of shipping fees. How much do you think that eats into commerce margins?
Now for AWS:
We can look at their market as digital natives: such as uber/lyft/snap etc...
And traditional businesses like airlines, manufacturing firms, and you name it. The digital natives definitely increased their usage. But what percent of total does this make? Will it offset the reduction in spend by all other firms? 

Overall price went up around 25% so do we think Amazon’s earning will increase by this much?

First, find a stock you’d be happy to own 100 shares of at the current price, preferably on a day the stock is dropping in value. Next, pick an expiration for how far out you want to go. It doesn’t really matter how far out you go. What you’re looking for is that the ATM call premium and the ATM put premium are close to equal. 

How about an example? Last month I did this with Wendy’s. At the time, the stock was trading for $11, so I sold the $11 august put and bought the $11 august call. I paid .03 for this. Effectively, I bought 100 shares at $11, except my broker only required me to give them $3. This morning I sold off my call for $800, and I’m keeping the short put till it expires worthless in august. I did the same thing with CAKE today. I sold the $17.5 put for January and bought the $17.5 call for January at a premium of $1.83. 

This strategy is used to gain leverage. If you’d like income as well, you can sell calls against your position. We call this the poor man’s covered call. Because your broker only requires you to have 20% of the cash to cover, the return on capital is substantially better. Now you’re probably wondering how much your broker charges you to lend the money for this position. That would be zero. Unless the short put you sold is exercised, your leverage is free.

Which has caused (in general) a substantial dip in share prices. The Mines can’t produce gold and other minerals and there stock has dropped. Simple.

This has effectively halted the gold supply coming from all over North America. Many mines will begin to resume operations in the next month (see above link), coinciding with a fairly predictable increase in gold prices.

Do the math.  CDE is at a 3 year low, coinciding with a global drop in gold prices and exacerbated by COVID. The price of CDE when gold was at $1700/oz was $15, and is currently at $3.50.

This companies mines (and others I’m sure) are slowly re-opening, and gold will likely be increasing in price. Seems like a good reason to be bullish.

980,DD,NYCB,10,g6vhi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6vhi9/nycb/,9,1587706549.0,"New York Community Bank - NYCB - has about $53B AUM with half that in NYC rent-stabilized multifamily commercial mortgages. The rent stabilized tenants are first to be hit by high unemployment. 30% of tenants in USA didn't pay rent in April. Slumlords here in NYC are not too big into the whole cash reserves thing. This, combined with the devastating reform of rent control laws in June, make NYCB look like a big clusterfuck in the mid-term. They have earnings on April 29, I am currently holding bear spread. I can't guarantee that the shit will hit the fan this quarter because we only have one month of missed rent so far, but I feel pretty sure that one of the next 3 quarters is gonna be a biggie. NOTE - big deal - NYCB claims they have a LTV of about 53% across their rent stabilized loans, but these properties are all severely devalued after June rent laws. The numbers haven't caught up yet because there were not that many sales in the meantime.

TL;DR NYCB P $10 5/15

Oil Oil Oil. Yes it's already known here that Tankers are about to rocket to the moon and then Mars. Storage across the country is completely full and rates are soaring to beyond price gouging like rates!

A Lot of us are investing In oil tanker companies, correct? Well what about land based storage companies? Duh, that obvious right! So obvious I didn’t consider it thinking it was so obvious everybody would have pumped them already. Boy was I wrong.

A Headline caught my eye yesterday. DKL up 50 percent in a day! DKL is a land based oil storage, and transportation company. Wow I thought, that is crazy they are still below their all time highs too. So then I started doing more research and put together a list of pipeline, midstream, and logistics companies. And nearly all of them are forming cup and handle formations. BUT THE BEST PART IS THE OPTIONS PREMIUMS ARE STILL DIRT CHEAP!

Point is, just like tankers these land based storage companies should be at their all time highs. They are already raising dividends! But yet they are still down 30-40 percent from yearly highs. I am going YOLO, I never do that but this trade is simply to good. Almost all these companies report during the first week of may or second may, mark my words they will pump. THE CALLS ARE INSANELY CHEAP. Get in now. I'm talking 10,0000 PERCENT GAINS.

In my albeit limited clinical experience with compassionate use remdesivir, I have gotten the general impression that it improves outcomes at least in the critically ill population. In light of today's Statnews development, I took to the data to determine whether the numbers really are on GILD's side.

I reviewed all available large case series from Pubmed and Medrxiv to develop a very basic meta-analysis*. In total, 9 studies were reviewed, including Richardson, Grasselli, Wang, Guan, Paranjpe, and Yang to develop a cohort of controls, and compiled data from Grein, Kujawski, UChicago, and WHO's most recent leak to comprise the intervention arm of the meta-analysis.

POOLED CONTROL COHORT (Death Rate / Total Hospitalized)
Richardson (291 / 2634)
Grasselli (405 / 1591)
Wang (6 / 138)
Guan (15 / 1029)
Paranjpe (313 / 1078)
Yang (32 / 710)
Total = 1062 / 7180

POOLED REMDESIVIR COHORT (Death Rate / Total Hospitalized)
Grein (7 / 53)
Kujawski (0 / 3)
UChicago (2 / 125)
WHO (22 / 158)
Total = 31 / 339

In total, 1,062 patients out of 7,180 in the pooled control cohort died (consistent with the estimated 18.8% mortality rate cited by CDC currently), compared to 31 out of the 339 in the collection of remdesivir trials (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.90), implying an effect even taking into consideration today's update.

There are obvious limitations here. First, there was no way to control for APACHE scores (level of clinical severity) among trials, and hospitalization causes vary widely among healthcare systems; these studies were collected from China, Italy, and the United States, each in different timepoints of the outbreak curve, which may necessitate different admission rates. This is somewhat reflected by wide variance in intubation rate (45-85%), a surrogate marker for severity in this case. Additionally, this data relies on the two reported deaths from UChicago's cohort of 125 patients treated with remdesivir; this may skew mortality downward as clinical courses are not yet complete. Lastly, inpatient mortality data from the included Chinese studies (Wang, Guan, Yang) is significantly lower than that published by most public health agencies (4 vs 18%), suggesting a within-study skew toward lower mortality in the control arm.

More data is obviously required before meaningful clinical guidelines will support remdesivir, but ultimately, despite the extremely wide confidence intervals and important methodological limitations here, I suspect the data reflect a mortality effect at least in the critically ill population.

TLDR: GILD 5/29 $90C

ELI5: GILD took a dip today on a Statnews report that a small prospective cohort study found no clinically significant benefit to remdesivir in treating COVID-19 patients. Top-line data from main tranche of clinical trials are pending, but remdesivir production is ramping up globally on hopes that it will be shown to have at least a moderate effect. I felt that today’s data were not in line with the clinical experience we have had, and conducted a heavily-caveated meta-analysis to check this hypothesis. This analysis supports increasing positions in GILD on market reaction to this downturn.",2020-04-24 00:02:22,-0.9984,0.1027,0.0913328767123288,-0.2681223744292237

Let's say best case, we can all go back into the office on May 1. I'm a consultant, I travel around the US. Do you really think we are going to be doing business travel anytime soon? My company already said non-essential business travel will be restricted until the 4Q at best.

We are trying to get back into the office. That's step 1. Steps 2,3,4 will be way down the line and that's business travel, business conferences which is how these hotels make most of their revenue. It isn't vacations.

\----------------------------

I'd say that a 1400-patient, controlled study is wayyyy more legit than that anecdotal shit that pumped GILD.  The paper was published three days ago and I cant find shit about it on the news or google searches.

Ivermectin is an FDA-approved antiviral and antiparasitic, that was made years ago by Merck. Merck still sells the name brand in Canada. It's used around the devloping world for worms and other parasitic diseases. However in the US, Ivermectin is primarily used as a lice treatment for kids and as heartworm prophylaxis in dogs (Heartgard). I may have some biases here, but I believe that this isn't being pumped by the media and Big Pharma as a treatment, **since it is a cheap, generic drug.** Disclaimer, the FDA has come out and said that people should not take Heartgard meat-flavored dog pills for COVID. (PLEASE DONT TAKE HEARTGARD, FAM.) But, I do think if people knew about this study it would have to be seriously considered.

This drug has done work in humans for years in the developing world, check out the wikipedia on it if you want a quick summary. I'd say it's worth a shot. I'm only a medical student for what that's worth.

\----------------------------

Edit: Since there seems to be some confusion on how ""legit"" a study is. There is a hierarchy in quality of research, especially in the medical field. It usually starts as an idea to use a drug based on an educated guess that its mechanism of action would work, then there may be a novel success or failure that leads to a case study write-up of a patient case, or several cases written up as a case series. That is where I would honestly put the Gilead research since the size of the studies were like a couple dozen if I remember correctly. Cohort and case-controlled studies are considered much more legit, especially with an n=1400. The ""legitness"" of these numbers in this study are much more solid, since a large study size increases the power of the statistical analysis. Of course, a double blind study or randomized control study would knockout more chances of there being biases or cofounding influences on the data, but they need robust IRB approval, are time-intensive, and may be hard to perform in a pandemic setting.

Allow me to give some of you cats the meow you have been oblivious to this entire time: JCP is about to be set on fire by 5/20, both in stocks and literally (maybe). **As we all know heat only rises, never falls.**

JCP: Jcpenny, was and still is (strangely) one of the biggest clothing/style/makeup retailers out there. You may be fooled by their balance seat and their crumbling technicals but let me enlighten you on why this is a bet you want to go in on.

Jc penny has been hated on for awhile by investors and fool subscribers, the later of which also likely use RH exclusively as a broker, and that's all well and fine but there are multiple aspects that are overlooked:

1. Despite Macy's and other similar retailers being worth more with better prospects only JCP was able to land contracts with several clothing brand or makeup companies like [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/beauty/sephora-inside-jcpenney) for example.
2. JCP has (cumulatively) arguably more expensive real-estate.
3. Expanding on number 2, most of JCP's highest real estate properties in value are low traffic stores which they can cut to save money and sell for insane profits.
4. Most of JCPs creditors (quantity) are trying to sway JCP from bankruptcy.
5. JCP still has potential deals [working with more companies on the table.](https://ir.jcpenney.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/589/jcpenney-partners-with-thredup-in-new-business-model)
6. JCP has brought BC(Bankruptcy) to the table, but they have a Pump balance sheet that, when combined with several creditors not wanting them to file, makes lt *~~very likely~~*, **nearly guarantee** that JCP will dodge bankruptcy and will continue on until their gamble fails and the company burns up.

Before continuing let me let you know what a pump balance sheet is because people who haven't been in the market long, or who have been in the market long but haven't really learned how it works (despite thinking they do) will need this education for Due Dilligence.

Now as we all know, JCP ""balance sheet"" is a mess, and when you read ""pump balance sheet"" you likely  flipped back in your chair hitting the floor head first, and no I will not be paying for the damages for you being a dumbass. ;)

A **""pump balance sheet""** is when a company that's not doing well, still has a ""balance sheet"" in terms of having access to assets, funds, and opportunities to turn around..........***temporarily***. Hence the word ""pump"" being included. Sometimes Pump balance sheets can temporarily turn companies around.......... for a short amount of time or it can result in an even shorter pump and dump period.

And that's exactly why we are here ladies and gentlemen. JCP is going to dodge bankruptcy, announce partnerships that likely won't make it in time before the company implodes, will cut some of those high value real-estate, and **it will be enough to push a  short-term narrative that the company is improving and heading in the right direction. This will cause the stock set on fire and jump!!!!!**

....***For a period of 1 week to 2 months*** depending on how they execute. At that point the company will implode, and while it may still be possible for them to still choose to go bankrupt at that time it's very likely that will be heading toward closing things down and liquidating instead.

However, this very soon to come (very soon) pump in the stock is very very close to happening and this is the time to have JCP redeem itself by making people rich.

**Options call:** minimum $3c, contracts I've seen are .01, which means a $1 per contract, 2500 contracts is $2500, but that's minimum, higher the better. Expected it will hit and slightly pass $6 with a good chance of passing 7. Lower chance it will head near $10. 5/20

I will be going 3000 contracts in once I shift from my RH account back to Schwab, still waiting on the transfer. Have used RH for 3 months to try it out, see why it has mixed to mostly negative reception, nearly unusable on every level, oversimplified, makes kids think this is easy and they understand how it works, but they don't have any idea what they are doing. For me, it gives me no info and at best looks pretty...after hours when the design is green and black.

 **Update your models: NYC reports 5 in 1000 death due to covid and 14% antibody positive rate. Germany has been reporting 3.75 in 1000 with 15% antibody positive rate for a while... flu typically kills 1 in 1000 (max recorded for flu mortality is 1.4 in 1000 in 2017 )** 

 

NYC results are in line with what Germany has been reporting. Considering obesity epidemic and higher percent of African Americans (who are infected at a higher rate), NYC numbers are in line with the German reports of 3.75 in 1000. Higher rates reported before by various countries were because we didn't have the correct denominator (number of people infected).

Some people would like to use 'years lost' instead of mortality rate. This would make Covid more similar to Flu, because Covid disproportionately affects seniors. This however is not the models governments use to make assessments. Few years ago this caused too much controversy and hence do not use 'years lost' models as economic decisions are not based on those models; ie no senior discount.

Currently 14% of New Yorkers showed antibody. As the number of people with antibody increases R0 decreases. California reports that when they retrospectively examined some death that occured in Dec-Jan and now we know that Covid was spreading in California in Dec 2019.

The fact that the numbers in NY and Germany are are identical is very reassuring.

Intercept Pharma has a new drug named Ocaliva awaiting FDA approval on June 9th. The drug is targeted to treat NASH (non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis). Which is basically a shitty liver disease with no symptoms until the later stages. The thing that makes Ocaliva special is that its the first drug to make it this far in the NASH market(aka there are no drugs available to treat NASH). Every other drug is still in trials.

As far as the efficacy and and safety goes, Ocaliva looks very well. Ocaliva has already been approved for different liver diseases (such as PBC) therefore the FDA already knows whats coming and what to expect. Sure, the drug has few symptoms like itching but most of the other major worries like cholesterol and liver toxicity has been cleared up by numerous reports done by the company or the FDA itself.

What I find the most exciting part of this trade is that the market still has $ICPT near its Coronavirus lows. Prior to hell breaking loose, the acceptance of the new drug was already priced in because it was damn near a statistical certainty. Therefore the price of the stock was around 110 to 120. As of now $ICPT is at around $80. I expect this stock to climb forward as it nears the FDA meeting in June. LMK any questions you have or if you think this trade is flat out retarded

I'm guessing we will have a relapse in a few months, but that's beyond the time horizon of my puts. I think the changing sentiments over the next month or so will curtail the unhinged speculative growth for stonks like ZM and TDOC.

Based on the dip and recovery of ZM, people have essentially shrugged off the security issues associated with the app. Some autists have offered their family Easter spyware sessions as anecdotal proof that the company has no direction to go but up. The problem is that ZM doesn't make money when grandma uses her free subscription to virtually judge how shitty of a job your parents did with you. Revenue comes from organizational and corporate use, which is dwindling. It really doesn't matter if ZM says they have a patch. The damage is done and your company knows they will look inept if they get caught with their pants down after continuing to use ZM. It's a ""fool me once"" kind of game.

This wouldn't be a problem if ZM had some kind of service or technology that set it apart from other providers and warranted a subscription service for all users - but it doesn't. Personally, I think the app is shit for both mobile and computer uses.

The unwarranted optimism about ZM is giving me a throbbing red FOMO boner. I will be shorting this meme stonk and incinerating what little funds are left in my RH account.

Buncha half senders over at r/Investing don't want it cuz they can't get their PP hard so you guys will benefit from my work instead of them. Y'all said you want investing ideas so I will list tickers and reasons to pursue.

Here's the deal, while Covid-19 has laid absolute pipe to most of the market, there are a few industries that will benefit from it:

**Retail/Wholesale:**

Tickers: BJ, WMT, KR, COST, HD, AMZN

Shopping has now become a weighing of risk for consumers. They want to make one stop to get their groceries, razors, and paint so they can pretend to be *White People Renovating Houses*. Foot traffic in these stores has either remained constant or slightly increased, however, their online traffic has significantly increased. For grocery, the margins for online are quite low, but it drives the sale of other items and keeps cash flow that generates value.

KR: Consistently beats EPS estimates. [Here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/kr/earnings). Likely to do it again.

BJs is an aging retailer that will eventually eat shit but for now its going to do well, people will flock to companies that are beating on earnings so it is a safe(r) bet.

WMT has seen a pretty significant price increase as of late, so if you are looking for those huge returns you are not going to find them there, but they are a safe growth bet in the long term and really showed their ability to handle crisis with the way they handled everything.

HD is definitely one of the best stocks to buy right now IMO. They are down quite a bit from the beginning of the virus, but are likely to beat on earnings and have seen an increase in traffic. This is likely due to the DIY Karens of the world who have decided to put on their safety glasses and tool belts and redo their bathrooms, paint every room that has a color on its walls and tell their husbands to go out and make their lawn the best it can be this year because they can't stand to see their family sit around and not do something to benefit them in return for all their dish washing. We salute you Karen and that new $500 Kenmore from Home Depot will definitely not take just as much time for you to load and unload you gullible sloot.

AMZN: Kinda a tricky one to be honest, while they are obviously doing well from the fact that when it comes to buying just about anything online and having your wife's boyfriend put it on your front doorstep, it was likely he drives a navy van with a weird smile on the side. But there are other aspects to look at too, the death of the USPS appears imminent, with Trump poised to do what appears to be nothing to protect them from ceasing to exist. There's a window of opportunity for them. But, IMO I would back off for now because their price has already mooned, outpacing their growth and making it overbought and overvalued. Set an alert at $1,900-2,000 and buy then. Just keep in the back of your mind that they are likely to face their biggest challenge of their existence in the next few years, which could either be that  a) they become too big and have a tough time getting any bigger. Or b) the government does what its supposed to and steps in, saying they've let the monopoly go on long enough and that AMZN needs to be broken up.

Overall, consumers are still shopping for what they need, and these stores have it. Trade earnings swings, or find a good price and lock it for a few years.

&#x200B;

**Food Service:**

You've probably seen this yourself if you've pulled up to Starbucks to get anally pounded by the skinny white hippy dude of choice, or if you went to McDonald's just to know what it feels like to not eat at home. Well, you're just one of many who have visited a fast food place and waited an insanely long time just to get a cup that you can pour out and put your booze in so no one knows you're getting hammered 30 minutes after waking up at 11:30. While business at some of these places hasn't necessarily increased, just moved to the drive through, some places that don't normally see a lot of window traffic have picked up. These companies are likely to do well over the next year or so.

SBUX, MCD, CMG, WEN, DPZ, YUM, GRUB, UBER,

SBUX: will run up and beat on earnings, then is likely to sell off a bit. Trade it how you want but they have a bright future ahead either way.

MCD/WEN: have shown the ability to innovate and grow despite size, GrubHub delivery and packed drive thrus they are another that will be benefiting from all the unlucky husbands who have useless wives that can't cook for shit.

DPZ: rallied hard the past few weeks, solid future potential, wait for the right price.

YUM: For the families who have bumshit wives that can't cook or are of a certain race in which their dad might

GRUB/UBER: both of these have seen tremendous popularity while everyone is stuck indoors, now that the anxiety has worn off and people are comfortable again, but still not able to go and eat out these have been the choice. Buy all you can at a comfortable price, these are here to stay.

To wrap up, I'll waste my time and try to tell you this: don't be an idiot. Take the 10% and move on. Don't YOLO AAL calls, don't try to buy a friggin oil tanker, don't buy AMZN puts. Just relax, stick to what you know will happen, and aim to get out of this with a profit of any size.

The stock was unfairly punished because of its 2019 merger and because it is a luxury goods company, which allows us to enter at a cheap valuation. Even if the luxury clothing market shrinks 20%  Farfetch's market share will more than double leaving their sales dramatically higher. 

**The stock was extremely undervalued before the crash:**

Farfetch was founded in 2007 two weeks before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. The stock IPO’d in 2019 around 23$ a share. The stock faced headwinds and eventually dropped 40% in a day after they bought New Guards Group for $675 million. New Guards Group (NGG) is a fashion distribution company who owns brands like Off-White, Palm Angels, Heron Preston, and other streetwear brands. On paper this deal looks retarded. Why is a tech company with significant cash burn buying a clothing company, which seemingly goes against Farfetch'd asset light model. However, the market was completely wrong. New Guards Group at the time had $95mm of annual cash flow with consistent revenue growth. Essentially they bought $95 million dollars of cash flow at a 7x multiple. This deal is crazy cheap, a strategic often pays double digit multiples when they buy another company. Furthermore, NGG is a fashion distribution company not a manufacturer. They sign these deals with designers to design the clothing and then NGG pays manufacturers to make it. Since NGG doesn't actually make the clothing they fit with Farfetch's asset light business model. Despite all this the market still hated the merger causing the stock to drop to 8$ a share in mid 2019. Company had great year end earnings, driving the stock up to 12. The stock then cratered and rallied with the market and currently sits around 12$.

**Farfetch is going to become the number 1 player in Luxury goods:**

Farfetch was a great investment before Beerflu, but now it is one of the best investments out there. They are poised to have a dramatic increase in market share. Traditionally 88% of luxury goods are purchased physically in store. For the boutique fashion stores that sell on Farfetch 70% of their sales come from physical stores. Lastly, China accounts for $100 billion of luxury purchases with $70 billion of those purchases happening while they travel. All three of these trends are going to dramatically change. According to Farfetch’s recent preliminary Q1 filing “China Region GMV in latter two months of Q1 2020 grew faster than full year 2019.” GMV stands for Gross Merchandising Value, which is the total value of goods sold on their platform. In two months that number grew more in China than it did all of last year. This move to online purchasing is mirrored in other luxury fashion company’s recent earnings reports. Analysts expected LVMH’s clothing sales to drop 15.8% and instead they only dropped 10%. This was driven completely by online sales since most of LVMH’s physical stores are closed. 

In addition to the shift online, most of Farfetch’s competition is going bankrupt. Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Ave, and Nordstroms are all likely to not survive this downturn. Neiman Marcus is already considering bankruptcy, and the other physical high fashion retailers are not far behind them. This reduction in competition will further contribute to Farfetch’s increase in market share. Due to the market shift to online and reduction in competition, I would be shocked if Farfetch’s market share didn’t double this year. 

**Just because they sell luxury clothing doesn’t mean they will struggle in an economic downturn:**

The luxury clothing industry will likely shrink in the short run, given the lock down and the economic hardship. However, Farfetch’s total sales will still dramatically increase due to their rise in market share. Even if the overall industry shrinks 20% in the short run, Farfetch’s market share will more than double, leaving their total sales in a better place than before the crash. Furthermore, most of Farfetch’s sales and revenue comes from extremely wealthy, price insensitive customers. 20% of Farfetch’s revenue comes from 1% of customers. If the global economy craters, multi-millionaires are still going to buy clothing. They might not buy a $300,000 ferrari but they will still buy a $1000 pair of pants.

Let's take a closer look as to why this is a short at these price levels.

# How Shopify Makes Money

*1) Subscription Solutions (\~40% of total revenues)*

Sale of subscription services to host a website. $SHOP offers different pricing plans depending on need ranging from $29 to a few thousand a month. The more merchants that enroll on the platform or upgrade to a premium plan, the higher the revenues.

*2) Merchant Solutions (\~60% of total revenues)*

The majority of this bucket is payment and transaction fees. In order words, $SHOP takes a cut of the gross merchandise volume processed on the platform. The more sales processed, the higher the revenues.

# What Shopify Sells

Discretionary products. Think apparel & footwear, beauty & personal care, home furnishings and your cousin's million dollar dropship idea . Example of brands on the platform include:

* Apparel: Kith, GymShark, Allbirds, Steve Madden, Chubbies
* Beauty: Kylie Jenner Cosmetics, Jeffrey Star Cosmetics, ColourPop
* Other: Nestle, Staples, Haus, Bullet Proof Coffee, Bombas Socks
   * [Other examples of ""SMBs"" stores](https://twitter.com/ShopifySupport/status/1252907509079252992)

Future online sales trends will align to specific industries based on consumer concerns and needs. Brands on the $SHOP platform are for the most part consumer discretionary spending, not *essential*.

# Recent, Concerning Events

* Press release on April 1 saying they will meet/slightly beat Q1 guidance on the strong momentum of ""January and February."" Also, suspend full year 2020 guidance.
   * Why no mention of March or suspend guidance?
* Extending a 90-day free trial to all new standard plan signups
   * Originally was 14-days. Short-term users will be up but they will not generate revenue from subscription (for at least 1Q) and how many will actually stay on the platform past the trial?
* Offering a [""Pause""](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/pause-close-store) plan. If merchants are having difficulty meeting the monthly plan fee, for just $9 (was lowered from $14 a few days ago) $SHOP will pause the store but that merchant cannot make sales
   * Why would a merchant continue to pay an expense if they can't generate revenue?
* CTO tweets they are experiencing Black Friday traffic and that may double
   * Of course traffic will be up since users are creating new stores. No surprise there but since when does traffic equate to sales?
   * This same CTO also filed an Intent to Sell form on March 23 for 13,000 shares or roughly $8.5mm at current share price levels.
* More than 27,000 discount codes have been recently created
   * Indicates merchants are trying to boost sales by heavily discounting
* Recent social media postings pushing merchants to [""pivot""](https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1250899717837533184)
   * Why pivot into something else if sales are great? Why push other ancillary items like gift cards or pay to view online classes?

# Catalysts

I won't even dive into the multiples but SHOP needs to show growth to make its current/future valuation work. I expect Q1 to be in-line or a slight beat per their press release. Stock may also rise from $AMZN reporting positive results next week. Q2/3/4 are where things unfold.

*Subscription revenue*: Should be down/flat as 1) users churn off the platform (already a persisting issue), 2) premium members downgrade their subscription to a more basic plan to cut expenses and 3) new users being offered a 90-free trial. This will be minimally off-set by merchants that successfully stay on the platform past the 90 days but I expect this conversion rate to below (see example of new stores created above).

*Merchant revenue*: Gross merchandise volume processed should be down as the volume processed on the platform declines from discounted or lost sales. This will be minimally off-set by merchants that are experiencing growth in sales (a small minority).

Also, there a risk of them issuing a secondary (diluting shareholders) to raise cash. They don't need it but you have already seen a majority of companies doing so to ""shore up the balance sheet.""

Showing flat/to little growth in an environment where they are expected to take share will tank the stock back to pre-Covid levels.

# TL;DR

Horrible macroeconomic backdrop setting in. A platform that does not sell any essential products. Volatile stock that has little upside given recent massive run-up but major downside risk if they miss revenue growth.

This does seem very highly correlated.  More jobs lost does seem to correlate nicely with a higher % gain in spy.  You can see on March 19th there were only 280,000 jobs lost and spy only gained .25%.  On March 26th 3.3 million initial jobs lost and spy gained 5.75%.  

Going forward as long as the initial jobless claim is over at least 1 Million I would recommend buying at open as it seems like a great buy opportunity.

Same for the pundits who are talking about stocks on the news and giving people advice. Have their lives changed that much? Honestly, probably not. 

Who has been impacted the most - lower income people with jobs in retail, service, restaurants, etc. Guess what? Generally, those people don't even have a month's rent in savings, let alone money in the stock market. 

In 08, the crisis was more financial. People with money thought the institutions managing their investments and holding their debt were going to go under. People's home values were dropping and they were upside down on their mortgages. Today, they are probably working from home, not really seeing much of a change in take home pay, and likely just letting their money ride in the stock market. 

So if the perception of the average mid-to-upper class person with money in the market is ""wow this sucks, I can't get my haircut and have to get takeout instead of sitting down at a restaurant,"" things don't seem all that bad. Unemployment numbers don't matter, because those aren't your peers losing jobs, they're people you have probably no connection with. So all you see is that we went from millons projected to die, to hundreds of thousands, to now 60K (which will obviously be exceeded). So your biggest concern was probably that you were going to get sick, but now that seems like a long shot. Now you think the economy is going to open up, and you didn't really ever feel that much pain.

Scandinavia is one of the regions that was hit early on, right after Itally (a lot of norwegians, swedes and danes go to Italy during February for ski-trips). I thought I'd showcase our perspective on the apparel industry for the foreseeable future, after COVID-19 has started retracting in our region. 

Right now the vast majority of clothing stores are either shut down or open for limited hours. Some countries are less affected (so far) and are doing business-as-usual. 

Here in Scandinavia, we're seeing a sharp decline in COVID-19 cases, and the governments have been slowly opening up again. Some stores are ""re-opening"" and operating under limited hours, while others are intending to open within the next week or two. 

___

Traffic in most shopping streets and malls are back up to roughly 70% of Pre-Covid levels. However, the clothing stores are still at roughly 30% of Pre-Covid levels. Why is that? Well, customers' mentality has changed drastically. The need for fresh new clothes and outfits are down the drain, most people leave the house half as much as they used to, if not less - and people are being conservative with their finances because of the looming uncertainty about a second wave, or the financial system declining further. 

The people visiting shopping malls and streets are more often than not on a ""specific mission"" - they are looking for that skillet they need, or the batteries for their remote, or an electric drill to help with kitchen renovations. 

People are still conscious of the virus and how it spreads, and are pretty good at social distancing and minimizing chances of crowded areas. Because of this mentality, why go into a store that you don't *really* need to walk into? You dont *really* need those new shoes or that new pique, do you?

____

Most clothing stores took delivery of their Spring/Summer stock around February/March, and are now left with a metric fuck-ton of clothes that are barely moving, if at all. These clothes **have** to be sold at some point. What happens now? Stores will have to do absolutely crazy discounts, and there will be competition between stores to sell their assortment fast and efficiently. We are already seeing this in Norway specifically, where our neighboring stores are slowly inching up their discount % and some stores are already at 50% store-wide. 

The financial implications of holding massive inventory for a full season that will barely move, are not only affecting the stores themselves, but also suppliers across the world. They are destined to have massively reduced orders for the upcoming Fall/Winter seasons. Distributors and producers are also fucked. 

**Conclusion**: Physical clothing retailers are very, very fucked. This problem isn't gonna magically go away, and even several months down the line, retailers are stuck with excess inventory and **still** less demand for their products.

When gambling, always ask oneself what relevant outcomes and data that is not visible.  I can think of no other concept that is more important in investing and trading.

Some examples

* A 2 week old reddit account posts a prediction that turns out to be correct.  Then his options position drops by 90%+ in a week before expiring worthless.  The redditor most likely had other failed predictions on other accounts which are not visible.  If one only saw the correct prediction without asking what is not visible, and then followed the redditor like a lemming, they would have lost money.

* Money losing traders on a message board posts constantly about small scalp gains, while don't tend to post their losses.  Someone who do not understand survivorship bias will get the impression that the posters are far more profitable than they actually are.

* An asset management firm advertises their new fund, which has impressive returns since inception, including a 50% return the first year.  The other funds which had poor returns the first year were discontinued.  Those investing based on returns since inception falls victim to survivorship bias, as the first year return is not indicative of the true population of past returns.

* A jackass of a quantitative analyst unveils a new, likely complicated algorithm that he asserts have performed well in back tests, and also performed well in actual tests.  What the quant fails to mention is that millions of convoluted algorithms were back tested and forward tested, and that extraordinary returns of any single algorithm is likely due to random chance.

* A self proclaimed guru points to his correct predictions.  The incorrect predictions may be ignored or outright deleted (isn't reddit great?).  Someone who only sees what the self proclaimed guru posts and does not understand that other failed predictions would not be visible has a false impression of the self proclaimed guru's abilities.",2020-04-23 17:43:43,-0.9993,-0.1027,-0.01964000000000003,-0.37388

My impression is that most blue states stay closed for another month, which would keep this rate/unemployment claims up.

Ultimately, there are probably two rates. A ""soft"" unemployment rate (rate while every business is shut down) and a ""hard"" rate (the rate it stays at once businesses and the country re-open). What is everyone's guess as to the hard rate relative to the soft rate?

At that point, businesses will have gone under. Hard rate matters if you still believe in fundamentals. Impacts consumer demand/confidence on re-opening. May feed into a thesis I'm developing that for as bad as the shut down is we see extended GDP decline through re-opening b/c of the underlying problems caused by the ""hard"" rate.

Credit Card processing is very important as it’s a key indicator for consumers spending.   Scroll down for  Puts/Calls.

**Parties Involved to make it work ?**

1.) Consumer   --- end user. Credit Card holder.

2.) Merchant   --- Business establishment accepting  payment. These guys pay out all the fees

3.) Card Brand   ---- Visa, Mastercard, Discover (Diner Club,  Union Pay), American Express,

4.) Sponsoring Bank   --- handles risks, daily balancing, funding the merchant.

5.) Issuing Bank --- Issue the credit card. If your credit card say “ Chase”, then Chase is the issuing bank.

6.) Processor  --- transactions run through these guys. Think of them as a highway to run  and verify transactions

7.) ISO --- Independent sales office. These guys are the one who call business to sign them up with “ use my company

for cheaper rates”

**How**  **does each Parties make money ?**

1.) Consumer --- they don’t  anything as they are the purchaser.

2.) Merchant --- they pay out all the fees. At the end of the month, they get a bill for the privilege of being able to accept credit card.

3.) Card Brand --- Card Brand is pretty much god. They make about 15% of total fees paid out to merchant.   Look up  FANF, dues & assessments. If Visa need money, they just increase their rates, that’s it. More on this later.

4.) Sponsoring Bank -- these guys make the least out of everyone in the group. About  0.01% -0.03%  ( 1 to 3 BP) of total processing volume.

5.) Issuing bank -- “interchange” is paid out to the issuing bank. These fees account for about 75% of all total fees.  Card Brand dictate interchange. I’m not going to go into qualifications, etc….. Interchange rates is publish for each card brand. Look it up.

6.) Processor --- these guys usually make money on per transaction counts. About $0.02 -$0.05 per transaction and bunch of other misc fees.

7.) ISO --- whatever is left over goes to the sales group.  In a normal business niche ( not high risk or CBD/ cannabis), profit is about 0.30% - 0.50% of total processing volume.

**Profit Math**

Merchant’s fee – ( issuing bank + card brand ) = ISO’ Gross - ( Processor + Sponsoring Bank) = ISO’s Net.

**Fees:**

Always have 2 parts.

a.)  Percentage  multiply by the processing volume.

b.)  Fix charge multiply by the transaction.

What if you as a sales office  charged merchant 2.75% ( SQUARE) and  nothing else? you would  net negative on any transactions under $10 and  net positive on any transaction over $40.00

Why ? because interchange for a signature regulated debit is  0.05%+ $0.22( per transaction) not including all the other costs.

**State of the world.**

All 50 states have stay-at-home orders. Some states are talking about opening up again ( GA, FL).  Guess what ? it’s the Consumers who’s going to decide when to “open” up. Household spending account for 70% of annual GDP.

The rest of the world is on lock down. Even after opening up, it’s still bad.

**Great……**  **Give me puts or calls……………..**

1.) Card Brand   ----

a. Visa ( V)  -- earning is on 04/30. They are  the god in this business. They have the greatest exposure in US and overseas. There is no place in asia or Europe that does not take Visa. They increase their rates twice a year. Rate increases scheduled for this April was pushed back to July.  Their earnings will be absolutely horrible as the rest of the world started shutting down in Feb and US in march.

i.  Waiting to be fill --- V 01 May $160P

ii. Waiting to be fill --- V 19 June $135P

b. Mastercard -- earning is on 04/29 -- They have the second highest processing in US. Also like Visa. If you are playing earning, any puts within 5% will be good.

c. Discover ( DFS)  (Diner Club,  Union Pay) --- Earning  4/22 -- I had  15 X $2.72 01 May $34C going into earning. CALLS?? WTF?? 1.) they announced dividends right before earnings. 2.) They own debit networks. Think grocery stores, liquor stores, cannabis shops. 3.) Dinner club, union pay, paypal all goes through them to process on a traditional level.

Results:

Q1 GAAP EPS of -$0.25 misses by $1.61.

Revenue of $2.89B (+4.7% Y/Y) beats by $10M.

Shares -5.3% AH.

Going to exit my position at open with probably 40% losses.

This is good, if  DFS  missed by bad, the rest will be way way worst.

d. American Express ( AXP) ---  rich people’s credit card.

2.) Sponsoring Bank   ---

a. FITB -- 4/21 --  missed earning. Went down on 4/21 then went back up.

📷

3.) Issuing Bank --- I would not touch issuing bank as they are too diversified.

a. Chase

b. Bank of America

4.) Processor  -- do your own research.

a. Global Payments

b. Fiserv

**Other:**

SQ ( Square) -- earning 05/06. I did not talked about Payment facilitator. Which is kinda of what they are.   Here was a post on here  “ Square InC, SQ Puts—let’s be rational. Right direction but wrong DD.

Square  is all domestic and make their money primary from

1.)  Credit Card processing --- they will give merchant, 2.75% or $275 total fees. Their credit card processing  is net negative since inception. The reason is because of their client base ( mom and pop, start up, small transactions type businesses). 2.75% is a good percentage on volume but the $0.00 per swipe is killing them by the time they have to pay out interchanges  and dues assessments.  Their average ticket have to be over $25.00 to be profit. But the business model will not allow it. Small mom and pop go to them because lax underwriting,  and it’s a lot easier vs a traditional model. Most of their merchants is under 10k in processing.

2.) Hardware sales  --- very minimal 1 time revenue

3.) SAS ( Service as a subscription) -- Minimal revenue when comparing to credit card processing. They are also waiving all the software subscription fees for the month of April.

4.) Others…………

**I WOULD NOT TOUCH SQUARE.**

1.)  In fintech, you don’t need to be making money. You can have years of losses and stock will go up. Why ? because it’s about acquiring a large merchant base.

2.) Jack Dorsey -- yes the Twitter guy. He’s the founder and ceo of Square. He’s the Elon Musk of this  space. And you don’t mess with papa  Elon.

3.)  SQ is  APPROVED to make Emergency Small-Business Coronavirus loans. [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-paypal-and-square-are-rising-today-2020-04-22](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-paypal-and-square-are-rising-today-2020-04-22)

The exposure they get from this is HUGGGGEEEEEEEE.

Let’s look at today’s earning.

Q1 Adj.EPS --- $1.98 beats $ 1.43 estimate . **BEAT** **by 38.46%.** **this is only a 1.49% decrease over earnings of 2.01** **per share from the same period last year.**  Well, no shit. **They only did 15 down revisions** **last 3 months.**

Sales:  $10.31B miss $10.65 Estimate. MISSED by 3.19%. This is a 0.52% decrease over sales of $10.364 billion the same period last year.  Keep in mind US only started “stay-at-home” in march. Their Jan and Feb was still good.

Net Income: **They**  **posted a 76%** **drop in quarterly profit** and set aside 1.7B for potential non-payments. See link 2.  Net income fell to $367million ( 0.41 per share) compared to 1.55Billion or  $1.80 share a year earlier.

1058,DD,Why it's not hip to be Square ($SQ),115,g6ig5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6ig5m/why_its_not_hip_to_be_square_sq/,68,1587656344.0,"TLDR: 50% of Square's revenue comes from processing in-store transactions for physical merchants.  SQ said transactions volumes for all its merchants were down 25% on March 24th, but estimates from Opentable and other sources suggest things have gotten a lot worse since then.  45% of $SQ's transactions revenue comes from small merchants doing less than $125k in payments through it each year, and as much as 60% of SQ's overall revenues could come from restaurants, retail, and SMB ""services"" (like your wife's boyfriend).  Based on how Germany, China, and Korea have been recovering, small merchants will likely not get their in-store revenues back to normal until Spring 2021.  In spite of all this, the stock has outperformed its peers by 700 bps since late Feb and the S&P by 1900 bps YTD, as management talks up how their Cash App can earn a bunch of money being an intermediary for the JPOW SMB loans and TrumpBuxx.  However, even all that is unlikely to offset what very rough math indicates will be up to 75% of their EBITDA going away for the year.  SQ's next earnings call is May 6th.

What is Square?

Square offers payment services for small businesses through credit card and touchless dongles it gives merchants.  It gets a \~1% cut after interchange fees for this service.

https://preview.redd.it/xoqsabe1uiu41.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ade379c66db8f8151a62073493b9bd1e58d992c0

In case you're wondering, you have to be in a store to pay via these pieces of injection-molded art.

They also offer a cash app and working capital loans to the small businesses they've signed up.

Who uses Square?

This guy, and people like him:

Meet Chef Romeo of Romeo Chocolates in Long Beach, California.  When he's not busy making artisanal chocolate, he's getting his photo slapped onto page one of Square's 2019 Annual Report.

Are they still using Square?

No. Square claims they have an ecommerce api like Paypal or Stripe / Shopify, but adoption is low.  Case in point, Romeo Chocolates:

https://preview.redd.it/pv1xzed5uiu41.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=5da72090929860a1e4277b0f1f34830e4ed1c664

In these times of woe, Chef Romeo prefers you place your orders online.  For those orders, who helps process the payments? Google. Paypal. Shopify. Not Square.

How bad does it get?

Very bad. 50% of SQ's revenue comes from transaction payment processing (fees from Gross Payment Volume, or GPV); 45% of that comes from merchants who make less than 125k in payments volume through the platform and another 27% comes from merchants who make less than 500k in payments volume through the platform. Assuming half these smaller merchants are going to be doing minimal in-store business for the next 2 quarters, and most of these merchants will no longer use the SW services Square offers... you're looking at up to $350M of EBITDA impact, possibly more.  Square's FY20E was \~$500M, so this is a \~80% impact.

Why is SQ up?

https://preview.redd.it/xp9lqx97uiu41.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd1b260f2b93d746b46650461ec9fbfd73159cdb

For some reason, investors are confusing SQ's customer base with those of First Data/Fiserv, Elavon, Paypal, and Adyen.  Those companies are not the same as Square.  Their merchants are not hip.  No, those merchants (ie Costco) are sell uncool but wildly profitable things like toilet paper and bottled water.  In the COVIDian Maslow hierarchy, Costco beats sub-125k GPV merchants like Romeo Chocolates.  And over 60% of Squares customers are small retailers and restaurants.  Not exactly COVID proof.

When is the shoe going to drop?

May 6th is when Square releases earnings.  Investors will be looking for good vibes from the TrumpBuxx and JPOW SMB loans but all they will see - in the numbers - is a cavalcade of destruction.  I for one will enjoy watching management defend TEV/Forward Ebitda at 75x when Forward EBITDA is projected to drop 80% this year.

This is what Opentable says around half of Square's customer base has become:

Does this look like something worth 11x revenue to you?

I live in farm country and there are tons of empty grow warehouses that farmers built for the green gold rush that never happened. I could easily find space for 1k-10k barrels.

All credit goes to him for discovering this opportunity.

&nbsp;

For those of you who read and followed my DD on Tuesday morning:

I'm sorry for those who bought FLIR calls at the peak of $43 and then paper-handed at a loss later this week. Buy high, sell low. 

&nbsp;

But to those of you that held this weekend, you will be rewarded bigly for your faith. The MM's bought [one million shares](https://imgur.com/a/QVkWGh6) right at closing today in anticipation of the news that would be breaking over the weekend.

>Reuters is reporting that FLIR has seen ""exponential increase in demand,” said Frank Pennisi, president of the FLIR industrial business unit. He also said the company is ""having to prioritize hospitals and medical facilities.” FLIR is having difficulty meeting demand, frequently with one to two month backorders for these products.

Lastly, thermal imaging will be mentioned on 60 minutes, with FLIR's camera being visible in the video. Expect Boomers to be on this stock faster than a Briebart reader is on hydroxychloroquine and a z-pack thinking it's a cure for Corona.

&nbsp;

I know FLIR isn't only player in the game but it is one of the few publicly traded and they also sell a shit-ton sensors to 3rd companies who don't have the resources and patents to build their own.

Can we also get a big GUH for u/BigBrownBearMarket who entered a [massive short position on FLIR?](https://imgur.com/Aybg04m) Hope the autist sold Friday.

Positions? On top of u/awildianappears 's mother. https://imgur.com/0huUVmr (Mods pls ban him if you haven't already)


But seriously, don't FOMO into call on Monday as I expect a massive pump and for [the love of GUH](https://imgur.com/Aybg04m) do not buy 5/15 calls unless you think they'll be in the money as IV crush and Theta will kill you after earnings are released. 

&nbsp;

Speaking of earnings, Expected EPS had been drastically lowered from last quarter (in Feb not accounting for new demand) and I expect extremely positive guidance moving forward. 

&nbsp;

$55c 7/17 calls but don't buy at the pump Monday. For those of you holding calls, look to offload some to cash in on that sweet IV on Monday. I'm pretty bullish on another big pump on earnings unless it has been pumped too much ($46+) before then. 

&nbsp;

PS: look into $WORK. They have been smashing their previous expected EPS quarter after quarter and I expect this one to be no different. Possibility of record earnings hasn't been priced in but I have seen no big moves by the MM's yet.

1072,Discussion,A High Level Guide to Trading Unusual Options Activity,308,g7lvae,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7lvae/a_high_level_guide_to_trading_unusual_options/,81,1587810736.0,"Hey all, I've received a good number of requests to post a guide on how exactly one trades high volume unusual options activity. I'll keep this fairly high-level, and I encourage those who are inspired by this post to do more research on the subject. My goal is to give you guys a guideline one where to begin your studies, but I'm not here to teach you guys outright on how to trade Unusual Options Activity.

&#x200B;

**What is Unusual Option Activity?**

Unusual options activity occurs when a certain contract on a specific series experiences unusually high volume. Generally volumes above one to two thousand on smaller cap stocks or in the tens of thousands for larger more liquid equities. 

&#x200B;

**What is UOA good for?**

UOA is primarily used to see institutional option order flow in order to piggyback off their plays. Institutions are smart, richer, and have far more resources than your average retail investor, so piggybacking off of their plays will usually net you a profit 9/10 times. Insider trading is a lot more common than you think, and sometimes you can see institutional order flow to predict big stock moves before they occur.

UOA is NOT useful for ETF's such as SPY, QQQ, or USO. I don't care how smart an institution is, no institution can predict the market. Even Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world headed by Ray Dalio, experienced massive losses during the current COVID-Crash. SPY is not going to hostilly takeover Apple. USO will not be bought out by Netflix. IWM is not going to have a shitty press release and tank after earnings. Stop burning your cash through trying to predict ETFs

&#x200B;

**How to Scan for UOA**

There are many services that can scan for UOA, but you guys all have google and I'm not going to shill products. Personally I use ToS's built in scanner. If you're interested, there are many videos on the art of scanning for UOA. 

One thing of note, websites like BarChart are good for a general picture, but never trade based on options activity found on BarChart alone. It does not show individual order flow and you have no way to tell if they were selling, buying, opening or closing positions. Plus they update super slowly so you'll miss out on trades anyways. 

&#x200B;

**Things to Look Out For**

Analyzing UOA is more of an art than a science. It really requires an understanding of different types of option spreads, MM behavior, option pricing, and fundamental analysis. It by no means is an easy way to make money and it is very difficult to differentiate hedges and bets. UOA is NOT the holy grail of trading, or else other people would have already jumped in on it. That being said, with proper risk management and a well developed set of financial skills, it can be a great supplement to an existing trading strategy. With that out of the way, here are general things to look out for.

* Volume to Open Interest
   * Understanding the Dynamics of volume and open interest is a great way to determine whether orders are opening or closing. 
* Bid/Ask Spread
   * Bid/Ask Spread analysis will help you determine how aggressive orders were and whether or not order flow was buying or selling. 
* Days till Expiry
   * This is the best method to differentiate between hedges and bets, but it is not an exact science and is sometimes very subjective until the trade runs its course. 
* Implied Volatility
   * Sets expectations of Institutions
* Charting
   * Option orders leave footprints in the form of MM orders. Learn these.
* Option Spreads and Strategies
   * You MUST have a deep understanding of every option strategy. These are critical to determine direction of bets. 

And that's about it. UOA is a difficult strategy to master, but once you know what you're doing it can be a consistent and profitable strategy. 

**TL;DR**: if you're reading this then this post isn't for you. Just buy SPY 5/1 200p.",2020-04-25 06:32:16,0.9998,0.0,0.35617836879432624,0.4519927895981088

04/18 - The Fed is beginning to dial back quantitative easing (QE) as stability slowly begins to return to the market. The Fed stepped up QE in March announcing they would be purchasing 500 billion in government bonds, and 200 billion in mortgage bonds to help restore the markets, and “prevent severe disruptions” to the economy. Then on March 23rd in an unprecedented move, the Fed announced it would conduct unlimited QE and take all measures necessary to support the economy and its markets. After about a month of aggressive intervention, QE will be reduced from 30 billion to 15 billion for the week of 04/20 - 04/24. At its peak, the Fed was spending 75 billion a day in asset purchases from March 19th - April 1st. Despite fears of inflation, for now the US inflation rate remains under its target of 2%.

\*\*Update\*\* Next week 04/27-05/01 QE will be cut back to 10Billion per day

04/18 - China reported a contraction of 6.8% in their economy since the beginning of the year. This is the first reported retraction in China's economy since they started keeping record in 1992. China had the most strict lockdown out of all countries who implemented such measures, and have so far avoided having to pump massive stimulus into their economy compared to other countries. So far Europe has rolled out a stimulus program worth 591 Billion USD, Japan has approved a stimulus worth 990 Billion USD, and the US has the largest stimulus package so far valued at 2.3 trillion. Despite a quick reopening and efforts to revamp their economy, many citizens are still remaining cautious and foot traffic to retailers have not returned back to normal. Global demand for Chinese exports have also dropped sharply, adding an extra layer of pain since China's economy is heavily dependent on exports. Pressure is now mounting for the Chinese government to aid its citizens and small businesses since wage cuts, lower production, and reduced hours are still in effect despite all their lockdown restrictions being lifted.

**\*\*UPDATE\*\*** *23% of the SBA loans went to California, New York, and Texas receiving a total of 81billion in loans. Retail, food and accomodation accounted for less than 9% of the approved loans despite being the industries hit hardest by the Corona virus. Construction firms received 13% of all loans,.*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/19 - Despite the recent rally in the market, not all stocks are recovering at the same rate and the economy seems to be moving in the opposite direction. While the S&P 500 gained 3% for the week, Small cap stocks in the Russell 2000 actually dropped 1.4%. A closer look shows that small cap stocks have dropped an average of 35% more, compared to the top gainers in the S&P 500.

In the month of March the US ISM PMI number declined from 51.10 to 49.10,  while the manufacturing PMI dropped from 50.70 to 48.50 which is the lowest reported level since 2009. A PMI less than 50 is an indicator of a contracting economy. Despite the 2019 market rally, US PMI numbers have been in decline since 2018. The US was not the only economy to report a declining PMI for the month of March, Europe also reported a drop in their manufacturing PMI from 49.2 to 44.5.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/20 - For the first time in recorded history, the price of oil contracts (for the month of May) turned negative and ended the futures trading session at -$36.73 per barrel. Despite cuts by OPEC and other countries, due to the continued lockdown of the global economy oil supply still far outpaces demand. It is estimated that currently for the month of April there is a demand loss of 29 million barrels per day. The Saudis are considering cutting their output ahead of the scheduled cut in May due to the falling price in Oil. It was decided that both Russia and Saudia Arabia would make an oil production cut of 9.7 million barrels per day starting in May. Commodity traders believe that today's crash was largely in part due to retail investors looking to off load contracts to buyers who would actually receive the oil as is required by the contract. The sudden selling frenzy was met with little to no actual buyers for the contracts. It is important to note that the price of oil is not negative overall, futures contracts for the month of June are currently at $22.60 per barrel.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/21 - On a day that I can only refer to as super Tuesday the markets may have actually started pricing in the possibility of an actual fucking recession. Obviously shook by oils futures contracts for the month of May turning negative the session before, the S&P closed down greater than 3%, Dow closed down about 2.6% while the Nasdaq posted the biggest lost of nearly 3.5%. FAANG stocks which had a massive run up during the April rally sold off particularly hard. $NFLX rallied after hours along with $SNAP due to stronger than expected earnings, while the ride sharing service $LYFT joined their counterpart $UBER in withdrawing guidance for the year of 2020.

May contracts for Oil rebounded from its negative price Monday, and ended in positive territory while June contracts ended the session down 65% dropping from $22 to $6 per barrel. Meanwhile, the largest Oil ETF $USO holds about 30% of Junes contracts, and suffered accordingly closing down 25% @ $2.81 at the end of Tuesday's session. There is fear that due to $USO owning the highest majority of June contracts, if the June contracts go negative $USO would end up owing money and be forced into a closure.

After the trading day the Senate voted to approve an additional aid package worth approximately 500 Billion. The bill has bipartisan support and is expected to pass the house as early as Thursday. It will add 310B to the SBA for additional small business loans, 50B for emergency disaster loans, 75B will go to hospitals, 25B to expand Covid 19 testing. Trump tweeted that after this bill was signed they will begin working on another aid bill to be released next month specifically targeted to the states who are suffering from lost revenue.

Also, sales of “previously owned homes” which accounts for a majority of the American housing market, dropped by 8.5% in March which was a larger decline than expected.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/22 - On a day that I can only refer to as “I’m an idiot wednesday” Markets rebounded and recession is cancelled

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/23 - Jobless claims were reported at 4.43 million on Thursday bringing the 5 week total to 26.5 million which is a decrease from the previous weeks. Most states saw a decline in initial claims compared to previous weeks, and decreases in layoffs as well. US manufacturing PMI fell from 48.50 to 36.9.

Gilead $GILD sold off this week after a trial in China was halted for their drug Remdesivir, due to low enrolment, in addition to there being no difference in the mortality rate for the patients on Remdesivir & the control group. $GILD replied that the drug is most effective when administered early and not enough people were enrolled in the trial for accurate results. Stocks quickly sold off of their highs after the announcement, at the time of this writing $GILD is down 5.72%.

In positive news Oil is rebounding for the 2nd day in a row with June contracts trading at $16.89 after dropping as low as $9.46 on Monday

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/23 - While we wait for the house to approve an additional $500 billion dollar in aid, it is reported that 30% of Americans who lost their jobs due to Covid 19, have not been approved for unemployment benefits. Due to either processing delays, rejection, or confusion about whether they’re still on their jobs payroll. The PPP (payroll protection program) is designed to loan money to non-essential businesses in order to allow them to keep their employees on the payroll while remaining shut down during the quarantine. There is concern though, that larger businesses have been taking advantage of this loan money despite not being classified as a small business, and also having available liquidity to pay their employees. It is reported that so far publicly traded companies have been given 500B in aid, and concern that banks have overlooked smaller applications and processed larger loan requests to collect more in processing fees. The US issued guidelines for accepting the next round of loans to prevent abuse from companies taking loans without needing to. So Far Shake Shack (10M), Harvard (8.6M), and Ruth Chris(20M) said they will return their multi-million dollar loans they received from the SBA. The government released a statement urging publicly traded companies to return the SBA within weeks to avoid being evaluated whether or not it was appropriate or not for them to accept capital.

\*\*Update\*\* - The additional aid was passed in the house of representatives on Thursday evening by a vote of 388-5, and was signed by President Trump on Friday. The markets didn’t seem to have any significant reaction to the bill at the time of its signing.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/24 - Despite intervention from the feds and aid for businesses the list of companies facing bankruptcies are mounting. So far AMC, Neiman Marcus, 24 Hour Fitness, Pier 1, JC Pennies, and Pier 1 are among the list of businesses who are said to be considering filing for bankruptcy or have already started. The retail department stores are said to be getting hit harder than others due to high cost of rent, and lagging sells due to online shopping. The longer the lock down orders stay in effect the more likely it is some of the giant retailers will not be able to recover. $SHOP & $AMZN hit all time highs as many investors believe that online shopping will continue to get stronger even after quarantine measures are lifted due to a large influx of new online shoppers.

Protests to reopen the economy broke out across 10 states this week, as people grow tired of the lockdown orders and forced closure of the economy. Although some but not all states are starting to ease restrictions on local economies allowing small businesses to reopen while keeping social distancing in place. There is talk about allowing restaurants to reopen but at half capacity. This added to concerns that social distancing in place even after lockdown orders are lifted, may harm businesses and reduce their flow of customers.

OK, so what?

So here's what I'm getting at... people have been working from home. They aren't **driving** to work. From what I can gather, about 95% of people in America own a vehicle, and **85%** of people in America commute to work using their personal vehicle. Here is a website that breaks it down per city...

What happens when people don't drive? They don't use gas, yeah that's already ""priced in"". Well what else happens when people don't use their cars... they don't repair them. Less people get in accidents, less people need an oil change. Less people need parts. ""Ok well I visit ol' Billy Bob down at Jimmy's Repair Shop and get my repairs done there."" Ok, well the other 75% of Americans that own vehicles go to a new-car dealership to service their vehicles.

Dealerships wrote more than 116 Billion in repair orders which was **1/10th** of total sales for all franchised dealers in the U.S. in 2018 according to NADA.

 [https://www.nada.org/nadadata/](https://www.nada.org/nadadata/) 

OK, get to the fucking point...

Not only will people not be buying new vehicles, they wont need to repair the one's they already have. This is a double blow to the auto-industry. Let's just say 50% of people get back on the road and need repairs and oil changes etc.. Doing some quick maths, the auto-industry will still lose an additional **150 Million dollars** of revenue **per calendar day,** every day, until this issue is resolved. That's something to consider.

For his first ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer spoke with Herbjorn Hansson, chairman and CEO of Nordic American Tankers  (NAT) - Get Report, the oil tanker company with a 9.2% yield. 
Hansson said that this is the strongest oil market he's seen in his lifetime and Nordic American is ""making a lot of money."" He reminded viewers that Nordic American doesn't speculate on the price of oil, they merely transport it where it needs to go. But with so much volatility in the oil market and historically low crude prices, many oil companies are using tankers to store oil until they can get better prices. 
Hansson said that Nordic American's fleet is being rented by all of the biggest oil companies for rates of $70,000 per day. That's helped them pay down debt and dramatically improve their balance sheet. Hansson expected to be debt-free in the near future.*

* Oil crashed on low demand.
* Sky-high unemployment numbers.
* Mixed earning calls and withdrawal of guidances.
* Treasury yields still gets lower.
* Lower volumes.

But:

* Equities push higher.
* VIX below 50 and still going lower.
* SPY establishes a strong support at 250 early April and trading within 269-290 with no sign of stopping.

My assumptions are:

* The stimulus/bond buying money is flowing into the equity market.
* Companies are now prepared and have liquidity to last 2 more quarters without substantial business.
* Q1 earnings don't fully capture the picture.
* Pessimistically, the country will start opening up again around mid-June with some guidelines.
* There will be sector rotation out of tech into travel and finance.

With those in minds:

* Oil demand for June/July should be stable/goes up.
* It is hard to see another leg down before Q2 earnings (June-July), when people fully comprehend the damage on the economy as a whole.

Hence, the plan is to capture some profits before the rotation happens:

* Cash secured puts for travel/finance (weekly or monthly)
* Covered call on tech stocks.
* Bullish put credit spread for QQQ and SPY with mid June expiration.

Last week we was a substantial spike in the stock prices along with the news of crashing oil prices.  This spike was followed by a very slow bleed as those who saw this coming months before finally took profits and sold, along with swing traders who took profits. I believe this slow decrease in price was not due to a lack of confidence in the companies’ futures but due to the aforementioned reason.

Now getting on to next week. Oil prices don’t seem to be showing any signs of massive recovery, although they did spike back from negative but up to still historically low prices. Demand will not be coming back anytime soon as people are jobless with nowhere to go, lockdown most likely sticking around for much longer than expected, and overall less demand across the board. This combined with the Oil contango allows tankers to charge ridiculous prices for storage. 

Now finally getting onto the new news as so far most of you probably knew all this. NAT CEO Herbjorn Hansson appeared on CNBC at 6pm ET today, and he was pumping like crazy. The CEO repeated “we are making a LOT of money” several times along with emphasizing their focus on stockholders with their recently doubled dividends. While most of this isn’t really news to many of you, this is one of the first times main stream media has covered this and should lead to a lot of the older generation to do some research and potentially sink some money into NAT. It’s already up in after hours 2% and has been steadily increasing over the past month.

Then again I’m a retard so you probably shouldn’t listen.

1089,DD,Cornerstone On-Demand ($CSDO) DD - undervalued gem in a remote environment,67,g7ifvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7ifvr/cornerstone_ondemand_csdo_dd_undervalued_gem_in_a/,73,1587797398.0,"$CSOD 5/15 $32.50 calls - 4 days after earnings. Today, there was an $80k OTM earnings bet, now why is this interesting?

Well this is a low volume stock, which means it is odd to have such a large volume buy on this stock which leads me to believe that this bet was an insider, and they know how the earnings report will go.

CSOD is a cloud-based learning & talent management company, obviously this virus gives them an activity boost, we will get to that soon; However, last conference call this quote is very interesting:

> we have not modeled any of the potential revenue opportunities in determining the medium term value of the deal.

This is in reference to Saba, a newly acquired business that will do this for CSOD:

> Our new company will have more software developers, more talent specialists and more expertise to support an expanded client community of over $75 million users in approximately 7,000 organizations of all sizes around the globe. and By way of background, Saba has a complimentary product portfolio to Cornerstone with approximately 3,300 clients and a global revenue footprint in 2019 of over $260 million. The company today looks very different from the last time they were visible in the public markets. You might remember that they went private in 2015 after a long history as a learning management company.

Oh so that isn't enough to convince you? Well how about this:

> The logins from 40 percent of Cornerstone Learning clients rose during March compared to February. The average company’s logins spiked 135 percent. 

> By industry, login increases came from nearly 60 percent of healthcare clients and 50 percent of those in public administration, education and non-profits. 

> Cornerstone found a 50-percent increase in the number of companies transitioning their in-person training to online formats. The verticals most affected were healthcare, finance and education.

> The increased focus on online learning is global. Organizations in Spain, Germany and the Netherlands generated a near-doubling of their LMS usage January to March. In South Korea, there was a five-fold increase.

Okay so the stats are telling us that $CSOD is experiencing unprecedented activity on their platforms. On a macro-scale, the US school system is already deciding to be remote for the second-half of 2020. This will be continued activity for $CSOD, AND on-top of that, they just finalized this acquisition of Saba which the following is not known publicky: **potential revenue growth from this acquisition hasn't even been modeled**!?

This leads me to believe that an insider has learned of the potential growth prospects over two major catalysts for CSOD: a) increased activity due to CORVID-19 & b) Saba revenue potenial models. Point A is important because of Snapchat, wait until they release new subscription numbers and activity impressions. Point B is important because investors have no clue what to expect, volatility will be here shortly.

TLDR: $CSOD is incredibly undervalued at its current price of $30.69, before the crash they had a pretty steady share range of $55-$60. With the acquisition of Saba and their metrics through the fuckin' roof, they are going to be above $35-$40 by June (as long as we don't crash again xD).

1094,DD,Small Cap Value - How to YOLO your IRA/401(k) intelligently,41,g7gyjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7gyjl/small_cap_value_how_to_yolo_your_ira401k/,35,1587792243.0,"**TL;DR:** Multiple indicators that small cap value is stupid cheap right now compared to large growth stocks. **Historically at these prices, SCV has returned 28% annualized over the next 10 years.** You'll just have to stomach the fact that there will be *wild* swings during that time. Buy $IWN or $VBR to play casually. Buy ATM LEAPs on $IWN if you play hard.

&#x200B;

For the retards who skipped investing 101 and came straight here to YOLO on FDs (god bless you), **what is small cap value (SCV)?** *Small cap* refers to companies with small market capitalizations which is the total value of all their outstanding stock. ""Small"" depends on who you talk to; it's always less than $10BB and usually less than $5BB or $2BB. *Value* refers to companies that are cheap, usually compared to their revenue stream or their to total assets. Value companies are the ones that you target when you are trying to ""buy low"" compared to growth companies (like Tesla) that you are trying to ""sell high."" Small cap value companies are rarely sexy, but they are good at paying the bills e.g. utilities, small banks, basic manufacturing, agriculture, small chains, electronics components, one-drug pharmas.

&#x200B;

**Pump Incoming:**

Since the big China flu drop, $IWN, which tracks the Russell 2000 value index has plummeted from an ATH of $130 to a low of $72 and has recovered to $85 [\[source\]](https://www.tiingo.com/iwn/overview). That is an \~11% recovery (and current drop of 35%), which is far less than the nearly 30% recovery of $SPY. The reason is that small value stocks face much more risk than large stocks in being able to stay solvent and because daddy Powell is doing less to help small companies. Before the drop, small cap value was already trading at a significant historical discount to large growth stocks, but now the level of discount is unprecedented. The small companies that skillfully maneuver their way through the crisis and eat other companies' lunches are going to explode upwards afterwards as their valuations reach back up to and beyond where they were before.

&#x200B;

[**A Historic Opportunity in Small Cap Stocks**](https://www.osam.com/pdfs/A_Historic_Opportunity_in_Small_Cap_Stocks.pdf)

In the article above, they cite a number of metrics that show the power of SCV to rebound.

1. Following the worst 25 quarters for small caps generally, which averages a 35% drawdown, their **yearly return was 38%** compared to only a 20% return on large caps.
2. The price per earnings spread between SCV and LCG has grown to over 21%. The spread has been that large in less than 2% of all months the US stock market has been tracked and when it has been that large, *SCV has outperformed LCG by 16.8% annualized over the next 10 years*.
3. The spread between price per earnings on SCV and interest on 10 year US treasuries has grown to over 21%. In the 1% of historical months that has been true, *SCV has returned 27.8% annualized over the next 10 years.*

&#x200B;

I am probably a bigger, gayer bear than half of you. But the potential return here is just too good to pass up. I think there is (much) more downside coming, but I'm getting in now and doubling down if the bet becomes even more favorable.

Don't be a retard and drop your entire retirement savings into SCV stocks. Put in an amount that you could stand to see drop by 50% without crying. The recovery might be some ways distant. If you have the balls to take on risky stocks that just got drop-kicked you very well could make hella tendies. It will work because it is counterintuitive and others are avoiding buying those same stocks right now.

His[most recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g69ccz/lyv_free_or_die_fuzzys_live_nation_breakdown/) goes through Live Nation (LYV). We get a breakdown of the company, their debt, the covenant and flexibility, and get some great takeaways. Now, fuzzy refuses to think for us because he (like a good daddy would) wants us to think for ourselves and get learned. I, however, love upvotes so I will gladly tell you smooth brained retards exactly what you can take away from fuzzy's post. Live Nation will make it through the pandemic easily. They have a spread out debt portfolio that is manageable and a shit ton of cash on hand. So you are all thinking, “Great, they are gonna be fine, no use in buying puts. Guess I'll find a different play.” and you are so fucking wrong I should break your legs. THEY HAVE A LOT OF CASH. This means that once we are through this, they will continue with the same business model they have been using and buy up mid-sized venues, smaller ticketing competitors, and TOTALLY DOMINANT in their market. Companies like Ticketfly, that have no money, will go under and will be bought further consolidating the industry. Live Nation will be an even bigger company than they are now and will absolutely go up in value. What can you take away from this? LONG CALLS. I know they aren't as fun. I know you have to be patient and that sucks but in the long run, you will make money. It's like buying Facebook before they bought Instagram.

There are a lot of companies that offer land based storage but these companies are low volume and cheap options plays (Low volume doesn't mean you can't make money, I'll get into it later).

All most of these companies also report earnings in the beginning of May so If you want a firm expiry I would say buy calls expiring late May/ early June. Oil WILL MAKE MONEY and I will endorse this myself. I plan to buy in next week. 

&#x200B;

**SBUX;**  Last, is Starbucks (SBUX). Now I don't do this often but I am going to inverse the post I am citing. Like the OP [of this post said](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78e7a/starbucks_sbux_guaranteed_earnings_play_lock_of/), Starbucks is coming off a good year. 9% global revenue growth, 539 New Stores (6% increase over prior year), American store sales up 6%, 3% increase in average ticket, returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. This is all great shit. Yes, they have a lot of stores closed, but drive by one of the open ones. There are lines weaving through the parking lots ALL DAY. They do not stop taking orders as long as they are open. BECKY will have her coffee no matter if there is a pandemic or a fucking tornado. I haven't looked into their 10-K or debt structure so I can't help with that but my belief is that they will make it through this fine.  

&#x200B;

**VOLUME;** Okay last thing. JUST BECAUSE THERE IS NOT MUCH VOLUME, DOES NOT MEAN YOU CANT MAKE MONEY. When you sell a position you don’t have to just hit send. Lower the price closer to the bid and it’ll get sold. Let’s say you buy a call for .36. This then goes up next week to being worth 1.44 however the highest bid is only 1.27. Instead of going to sell at 1.44, drop the price down to 1.35 and take the gains instead of hoping that they move the bid up. A gain of .91 to .99 is still good even if it is technically worth 1.08. Lock in what you have gained instead of being greedy. As long as there are more than 0 bids you can make money. There doesn’t have to be a ton of volume.

And this is just starting. Certain municipalities reliant on property taxes will fare better because no one wants to lose their house, but income and sales taxes are taking a heavy hit right now. Massachusetts has a rainy day fund of $3.5 billion but it's probably not going to last.

1150,DD,Starbucks (SBUX) - Guaranteed Earnings Play | Lock of The Century,30,g78e7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g78e7a/starbucks_sbux_guaranteed_earnings_play_lock_of/,63,1587763796.0,"I will try to keep this as simple and short as possible. Starbucks is set to announce earnings next week April 28th. The stock currently trades for $75 a share. This is about 24% off its all-time high price of $99.72 and about 33% higher than its 52 week low (Which occurred around March 18th). 

Our focus in this DD will be on its last Quarterly Report which was announced Jan 28th, 2020. In Q1 2020 Starbucks killed it with 

\- 9% global revenue growth

\- 539 New Stores (6% increase over prior year)

\- American store sales up 6%

\- 3% increase in average ticket

\- returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends 

During the Q&A Multiple questions regarding the China situation came up. John Culver explained that at the time “we currently have over half our stores closed in the market (China)”with the coronavirus, we are **not revising guidance at this time and as we get more clarity on the situation**, we will transparently communicate with investors. “

In the call, coronavirus is mentioned 9 times. 

So how can we estimate what percentage of Starbucks stores are closed in the US? 

&#x200B;

Well if we pick a random non-COVID epicenter city, something like Pittsburg PA we can get a glimpse. In the Pittsburg core area, we see 11 stores. **Of those 11 only 2 are working**. An of those 2 it seems only 1 is working full-time hours. So i**n Pittsburg’s city core 9% of Starbucks stores are open** (counting those with limited hours). It's reasonable to assume that conservatively 50% of Starbucks stores are closed around the United States and the ones that are open are probably working limited hours, or drive through service only.  

&#x200B;

[11 of the stores ](https://preview.redd.it/x364krqqpru41.png?width=332&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14dd47d4e4e76b493c34b48c73bd83c830575ed)

Starbucks is looking at a catastrophe. While its stock has been beatdown to $75 a share, I just don’t see a way they can provide the public with good figures in the near term. Half of its stores must be closed. IT's China business has been in jeopardy since Dec of 2019. Google Trends indicates slowing demand. And with no vaccine insight how much longer can they bleed. On top of all this even when everything opens up, how many customers will return to sit inside and work. How many commuters will simply go remote and never have the opportunity to grab that cup of coffee on their way to work?

Then when the peak didn't seem as bad as they thought it would be, they started using the IMHE model, and brought it down to 60K by August 4th. Trump even said that we could probably be ""substantially below"" that number. 

Well that model is now up to a 67K death number, and in my opinion, will keep going up. We are at 50K now. To hit the 60K number, with roughly 100 days until August 4th, that would have to be an average of 100 deaths a day from now until then. Our daily death toll is 20X that right now, and has hovered around 2,000 a day for over 2 weeks. One more week at even 80% of where we are today puts us over the 60K. I'd actually argue that we may not have 1 single day during the next few months with less than 100 deaths, which we would need to be at every single day for their projection to be right.

The missing link for sending these sub-prime lenders in amidst of a crisis to $0 was the fact that they could reach into any bank account and grab the money at will. In every portfolio they own, the largest majority of the loans are written in Michigan, which has been hit exceptionally hard.  All of the loans are sub-600 FICO with 22%+ interest and built for defaults to occur. Once someone defaults on the loan, wages are garnished, the vehicle is recovered and sold at auction to recoup as much as possible.  They sell you a car for 15k (worth 10k) for you to drive it off, pay a few months, then sell it at auction for face value. Rinse and repeat.

So what happens when A. wages cannot be garnished and B. the auctions are not moving cars? $CACC is stuck with the bill and incredibly vulnerable to collapsing.",2020-04-24 15:35:48,-0.8201,0.0,-0.30015000000000003,-0.3734166666666667

I am only linking FDA and Fauci stuff here, sorry Fake News Folks.

It has been LONG known that the drug has interactions with Heart Medications and those with arrhythmia. It says it in the Emergency use authorization. This was not something ""discovered"" out of thin air a few weeks ago.

\- Point (1) - FDA "" Although limited scientific information is available, it is reasonable to believe that hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be effective for treatment of adults and adolescents who weigh 50 kg or more and are hospitalized with COVID-19 for whom a clinical trial is not available, or participation is not feasible, as specified in this Fact Sheet.  You may be contacted and asked to provide information to help with the assessment of the use of the product during this emergency. Serious adverse events related to the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate must be reported to FDA through FDA’s MEDWATCH Voluntary Online reporting www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm. Please include in the field name, “Describe Event, Problem, or Product Use/Medication Error” the following statement: Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Treatment under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).This EUA for hydroxychloroquine sulfate will end when the Secretary determines that the circumstances justifying the EUA no longer exist or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.

Dr. Fauci mentioned you need randomized clinical controlled trials to approve a drug for an intended use. Dr. Fauci said there is neither enough data to support nor deny the drug at this point in time. He has to say that because it is his job and Fauci cannot tell you the FDA will approve a drug before it has finished a phase 3 trial.

If you look at the link 17 out of 30. SEVENTEEN OUT OF THIRTY  phase 3 trials in the USA involve some combo of HC/Zpack. Guess how many Remdesivir had? (less than 5). Interesting enough if you look at the design of those Remdesivir trials  - [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292730?cond=COVID-19&map\_cntry=US&phase=2&draw=3&rank=21](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292730?cond=COVID-19&map_cntry=US&phase=2&draw=3&rank=21) You will find that it is being compared to the ""Standard of Care"" Drug. WTF does that mean? What is the Standard of Care drug its being compared to? Well my guess would be HC lol.

\- Point (2) Fauci Said look up clinicaltrials.gov , if you actually did what he said you would see that 17 trials and over 10,000 people are being treated with HC right now..

If you see, Primary Completion date was April 21. 2020. Study completion date is May 12, 2020. 

\- Point (3) Dr. Fauci said recently that we will soon have promising therapeutics. There is no other phase III trial even close to finishing before HC does. How can Fauci say that if none of the other 13/30 trials are even close to finishing? Well it's because HC is going to finally have clinical backing in randomized controlled trials in May.

Capital One is basically a predatory lender. I have horrible credit, I was SHOCKED when *they mailed me* a credit card offer.

**Background**: Wingstop is a franchise based chicken wing fast food restaurant with 1253 domestic stores and 160 international stores. They only have 32 company owned stores which means reduced overhead cost and more reliance on the franchise segment of the company. Their revenue for franchisees in 2019 was 144.22M and their company stores was 55.45M. Profits for Franchise being 33.68M and company stores being only 9.2M. Current market cap is $3.37B and is currently trading at new all time highs at $114.40.

**Financials**:

They are currently flexing a PE ratio of 165.18 which implies Wing has more growth potential than Amzn with its PE ratio of 104.71. Though their revenue has been increasing annually with

133.32M in 2017

153.18M in 2018

199.68M in 2019

While revenue has been steadily increasing, their net has been steadily declining due to the growing interest expense due to their new loans. 5M in interest expense in 2017, 10M in 2018 and 17M in 2019.

Net 23.94M 2017

Net 21.72M 2018

Net 20.48M 2019

Wing has one of the worse balance sheets I have ever seen for a company valued above 1B dollars. Their current assets for 2019 was only 30.19M and their total assets only added up to 173.91M which counts 99.34M of intangible assets 50.19M of that was considered Net Goodwill which we all know isn't really an asset. Here's the disgusting part tho they recently took on a 300M dollar loan which matures in 2023. Increasing their total liabilities to 383.34M which is more than double their current assets which factor in 99.34M of intangible assets. Without the intangible assets being counted Wing would only have 74.57M in total assets which is more than 5 times less than their liabilities. This is the definition of being leveraged to the tits.

**April 7th 8-K report**:

Wingstop had an open letter to their investors, I am just going to quote notable points

"" we implemented a restaurant team member compensation incentive extending through April 30, 2020 that could provide as much as an additional $150 to full-time team members each week"" - Increased overhead but granted not by much.

"" Off-premise dining has historically been one of our differentiators and the Wingstop team is humbled by the trust our guests have placed in us as we continue to serve during this challenging time. Our business was well-positioned for the transition to 100% off-premise dining that has resulted from COVID-19. Carry-out and delivery represented approximately 80% of our sales mix before COVID-19, and our digital sales mix was just over 40% leading into COVID-19 ""

**Preliminary Estimated First Quarter 2020 Sales (UNAUDITED)**

Dec 29 2019 - Jan 25 2020-

Domestic Same Stores Sales +Grew 11.5%

Company Owned Restaurant Same Store Sales Grew +6.1%

Jan 26-Feb 22

\+10%

\+5.2%

Feb 23-Mar 28

\+8.6%

\+7.0%

So obviously this is fairly bullish news as they are actually managing to see some growth during the pandemic. The numbers might signal great fundamental growth until you realize the numbers they are flexing are the total amount of chicken wings sold but most of the company's money doesn't even come from sales but in actuality its the fees and royalties they charge their franchisees. I have read through their 10k and financial data trying to see how much of their revenue is based solely on Royalty revenue (Wingstop charges its franchisees 5-6% of each store's total sales) December 28th 2019 only 75M of the 200M revenue came from royalty revenue (which includes the 160 international stores, 11% of their stores, that are expected to take a massive hit in the coming quarters) So to summarize this growth that the CEO keeps bringing up affects less than half of their revenue so I do not expect a crazy revenue growth that the market and CEO is hyping up.

**Revenue Breakdown** \-

Royalty revenue, franchise fees and other- 44.2%

Advertising fees and related income 28%

Company owned restaurant sales - 27.8%

Also apparently there is an ""increased supply of chicken breast meat needed to support grocery stores where volumes have escalated, which has resulted in excess supply of jumbo chicken wings which is in turn creating a deflationary wing price"" which should also help them out in the short term, but admittedly I doubt this is significantly impactful as the cost of chicken wings was already dirt cheap compared to the markup.

While domestically they have been seeing modest growth, "" Temporary closures in international operations have been necessary and, in some cases, mandated. Most of our international restaurants enjoy a robust dine-in business, generally driven by their locations, including malls and high-density gathering areas."" International stores being about 11% of their stores and with a majority of them being closed down for an unknown period of time we can assume a decrease in international revenue of at least 6-7% depending on the actual number of closed stores, which would theoretically negate the growth we are seeing domestically.

Liquidity - ""With uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 events, and as a cautionary measure, the Company borrowed $16 million under its outstanding variable funding notes to improve its cash position, providing the Company with an unrestricted cash balance of approximately $31 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2020 compared to $12.8 million as of December 28, 2019.""

After completely depeleting most of their available credit lines due to the 300M loan they took our recently they were only able to gather $31M in cash for a company valued at $3.37B.

**Growth Strategy**:

The overall strategy for wingstop is to expand as much as possible pushing hard to open more stores. This is the only reason revenue have been growing, due to the increasing number of new stores being opened up each year. If Covid-19 were to significantly impact their growth strategy then we will see revenues flatten or decline and the CEO has already acknowledged concerns over their growth strategy in the coming quarters "" we expect a near-term impact to our development pipeline as a result of availability of construction, permitting, and inspections resources in this current environment."" Wingstop franchises are essentially small businesses which we all know will be taking a huge hit in the upcoming future and I do not believe Wingstop will be able to meet the growth expectations it is currently being valued at.

**Insider Trading:**

This is hardly concrete DD but my approach is get all the possible info you can out so you can start to put together the puzzle easier. On March 5th Charles Robert Morrison - Chairman, President and CEO sold 35,125 shares of WING at $81.20 close to 3 million in value, and on the 9th he sold another 1,000 shares at $75.64. There were 0 shares bought from insiders in the past 12 months. The total insider transaction in the past 6 months were -35.15%. The company executives aren't even bullish on their own company.

**Conclusion:**

Wingstop was overvalued pre corona and now even more overvalued with corona. This is purely subjective and speculative but I do not expect enough consumers to be rushing to buy wings to justify the recent rally and valuation. Regardless if we open up or not, I have a hard time believing the first restaurant you'll want to go to is Wingstop.",2020-04-25 22:57:32,0.9919,-0.4588,-0.04675491159135559,0.16211502946954814
1203,DD,COVID effects being wildly underestimated in several ways.,25,g7z3oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7z3oa/covid_effects_being_wildly_underestimated_in/,30,1587869846.0,"**Underestimating Covid**

I believe that the total death toll from Covid-19 even in the short term is going to significantly exceed the numbers the government has been estimating. Consider: current estimates are for 60-66k dead by the end of the summer, but these numbers seem increasingly, wildly on the low side even without any of the current rush to try to get back to normal. As of right now (4/25/20) we’ve had over 52,000 deaths already with close to 2,500 new deaths per day for the past week or so. Even just one more week at that rate puts us at almost 70,000 dead. Supposing that after that the rate of deaths drops by 15% per week, we’re still looking at around 145,000 dead by the end of the first week of June. If we rush reopening high-contact social events, businesses, etc. I don’t think it’s all unrealistic that we could see 200k dead or more by the end of the year…and how that would impact the economy can’t be good.

**The Oil Crisis**

The whole meltdown in oil prices might seem kind of abstract given that we haven’t seen the price at the pumps move very much as crude oil prices and production seems like some kind of governmental-level problem to be solved by the U.S., Russia, the Saudis, etc…but then keep in mind that the U.S. oil and natural gas industries support around 9.5 millions jobs (the actual jobs in the industry plus all of the jobs that exist because of the money produced and spent by those who work in the industry)…and what kind of ancillary jobs does the industry support? Exactly what you’d expect: restaurants, personal services, car dealerships, electronics, retail stores – all of which are already beaten up by the Corona virus shutdowns…

**Congressional Aid to Individuals and Small Businesses**

The $1,200 per person is already spent and gone – at best it paid some – not all – of already accrued bills and bought a few groceries. Without a monthly stipend, this level of “worker” / “paycheck” protection is just a band-aid on a severe injury. Ditto the small business loans – there’s not nearly enough there to cover the worst hit companies – the ones that employ 48% of American workers. Without significant and ongoing support for consumers and workers on the low end of the economic chain, there will be devastating effects on our core service economy, as well as a torpedoing of any kind of personal savings/economic security for the middle class and below, all of which will only serve to make this a depression-risking feedback loop. Polarization in Washington does not bode well for this more short term requirement for a return to normalcy, especially when such solutions are very much an emergency delve into socialism.

**Time Needed for Economic Recovery**

As of this week the unemployment rate in the U.S. just topped 20%, with 26.5 million jobs lost over the past month. You might say “yes, but when the lock down ends everybody will just go back to work” – except it’s not nearly that straightforward: many smaller businesses (and even quite a few large ones) run on extremely thin margins – a month, three months lost revenue while still having to pay rent, unemployment insurance premiums, healthcare premiums, etc. coupled with likely financial insecurity for those who own/run these businesses in many case could impact re-hiring, future hiring, future need for borrowing/indebtedness (at likely higher rates due to their now damaged finances/collateral for loans), investment in new inventory, equipment, locations, etc….there is going to be significant and hard to predict economic ripples from this that will extend out 12, 24, 36 months or more.

**The Emotional Hangover**

The Vietnam war killed 58,220 Americans…we’re going to surpass that with this virus by this time next week. Two of the deciding factors in turning the tide of public opinion against the war were seeing body counts and body bag on the evening news every night and the simple fact that once you lose enough people the likelihood that a lot of people will know someone who was lost, severly impacted in health or livelihood or both, or at least will know of someone who lost somebody will be huge, and will bring home the very real cost of the mismanagement of this crisis both scientifically and politically. Ironically, though I personally think that this will cost Trump re-election, having him re-elected (and thus preserving the popular, if wrong-headed (IMO) Republican approach of repeatedly bailing out mis-managed big businesses and perpetually cutting their taxes) would very likely buoy Wall St. In any event, the crisis and all the uncertainty about its personal effects and future economic effects will be devastating to consumer confidence, which in turn will only exacerbate a slow, uneven, and anxious recovery. 

**Tl;dr everyone is holding their breath hoping that the Covid crisis is temporary and that we’ve already seen/felt the worst of it. I doubt this, and I see it having a medium- to long-term effect that is significantly more than is priced into the markets. Once it becomes obvious that the Fed’s efforts can’t/won't do nearly enough to help the middle class, a spiraling down of consumer confidence will pull the markets down with it.

The Dark Index (DIX) and Gamma Exposure (GEX) have been a subject of debate in the discussion room lately. So i thought that it would be a decent to inform and provide my personal opinion on their movements. If this has already been posted then I apologize.

Here is the squeeze metrics [link](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?). Here is also another great form of information, it is more helpful in my opinion. It highlights everything that you would need to know about [dark pools](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs). 

I also want to note that we are in unprecedented times, the government is buying anything and everything trying to keep the market afloat. Trump is telling us that we will be reopened by two weeks ago. Oil is in complete free fall. Oh yeah and the pandemic. It turns out that the Brazilian president was wrong about his people being immune to the corona virus, which is scary because if it gets into the bat population in brazil it can mutate a lot faster. Any who, lets jump right in shall we? 

**The Dark Index (DIX)**

The Dark Index is a dollar weighted measure of the dark pool indicator. It tracks the dark pool short volume for components of the S&P. It is interesting to note that short volume is actually investors buying the underlying stock. So a high percentage (over 45%) for DIX indicates that the market sentiment is stocks only go up and there is more short volume than non short. This is confusing yes but let me try to explain it.

I am the MM and I want to make money today so i tell my HFT algo to create a spread for SPCE. It looks at current market and says Bid: $16.95 and Ask: $17.07. The spread is $0.12. The MM is offering to sell at 17.07 and to buy at 16.95. An investor A puts in an order to buy a share of SPCE at 17.07 and investor B puts an order to sell at 16.95. The MM will place a SHORT sale at 17.07, sell the share of SPCE at 17.07 then instantly turn around and buy a share back at 16.95 from investor B to satisfy its short sale. That is why investors buying are considered short volume.

So as of right now the DIX is at 43.98%. This means that only 43.98% of daily volume is short volume, aka people buying. Historically a rising DIX (yes that is funny laugh it up) indicates market sentiment is bullish while visa versa means bearish. In this case we are looking to get to see a further deterioration of DIX into the 42% to 38% range to see a drastic pull down. 

[Here is the White Paper they provide for more info.](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short_is_long.pdf)

The DIX has been in a gradual decline ever since we had out totally normal totally legal run up 30% in the S&P. Now we can move on to GEX or the gamma exposure.

**Gamma Exposure (GEX)**

This has to do with MM delta hedging against calls and puts. This can introduce a put squeeze which is essentially a short squeeze.

If a MM sells you a SPY 240 5/1 (RIP) it will immediately calculate the delta of that option and hedge accordingly. So lets say your OTM SPY put that you were promised was going to print tendies only has a delta of .20 (20%) then the MM is going to go out and short 20 shares of SPY to hedge against the risk. The shorting of those 20 SPY shares pushes the price down further and what happens when it turns out you were wrong about your SPY 240 put? SPY sits at 283 and the delta of your put has gone down to .10 (10%) so the MM no longer needs to hold 20 shorted positions so it buys 10 to keep a delta neutral portfolio.

A low GEX means that the options market is more geared towards puts. Yes i said it all you gay bears, but it is still sitting at 1,264M. But only 6 days ago it was at 6,412M so this is a steep drop off over the past couple days. A high GEX implies that MMs are hedging with ITM or ATM options because they are expecting a change in the current price direction. A negative GEX, like we had starting on February 24th of -773M (aka the real start to the whole downtrend) implies a put squeeze of 773 million shares for every +1% movement in SPY. (The same idea applies to calls buy in the opposite fashion) This creates volatility in the market.

**Volatility (VIX)**

THIS IS NOT TA ON VIX, im not telling you to buy VIX calls every time it dips below 50 that is actually retarded, but. 

It is not a coincidence that VIX jumped 46% the same day that GEX went negative. When GEX is high it insinuates low volatility, and when it is low is implies there will be.  As a bearish outlook and put heaving options market drag SPY down it creates panic. There are also people buying share as it is falling thinking they are getting a sweet deal on SPY when it is at 275 because it is only a pandemic right? stocks only go up? All while this is going on MMs had been writing puts and delta hedging appropriately. So SPY go up intraday 2% that is about 1,546 million shares of SPY getting bought to adjust for delta changing on Feb 24th. Then we degenerates buy more puts because basically they are on sale and the cycle continues until the MM can manipulate the market enough to get their gamma exposure down to decrease volatility. [Here](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/sp-caught-gamma-trap-despite-record-high-valuations) is an article that explains why we were stuck in that 270 to 285 window for like two weeks.

On the day that VIX peaked at around 83, the GEX was at -2,170M and DIX was at 37.8%. I am not saying that a direct copy of those levels for GEX or DIX will duplicate a record high volatility day but it will help. 

When VIX rose 20% from friday april 17th to tuesday april 21st, the most recent notable spike in volatility, DIX and GEX were both on the decline. 

**Why do I care about this information?**

The DIX went from 51.2% to 44.9% in the days leading up to that volatility spike and decline in the S&P500. It seems that DIX is a precursor to what direction the S&P500 will move in the coming days. So it should be known that it is coming off two year record highs and the only time DIX reached those heights again was in admits the tiny crash in the beginning of 2016 and a fallout or correction in 2011. 

On the other hand, GEX seems to mirror the S&P leading into down turns, it only leads the curve by a day or two. Please note that this part is just done by looking at the graph and seeing trends. But nonetheless, if you are a gay bear you want this index to keep falling. 

**Here are the GEX similarities between the last crash and now for the gay bears.**

GEX trying to rise then getting swatted back down implying turbulent days are to come. Just from eye balling the day to day change in SPY and GEX it looks like GEX leads a little and SPY lags. So look for another big drop in GEX, hopefully even go negative.

&#x200B;

Also another thing to note, like i said high GEX usually leaded to a pivot in the current direction of the market in the following time period. GEX was at 6,412M and below are times it has been above or at that in the past two years.

It will be very interesting to see what dark liquidity things of this earnings week for tech and basically half of the S&P500.

Similarities between DIX in the first crash and now for the gay gay bears.

* It is at its lowest in the last 20 trading days
* last time it was at 43.9% was march 11th aka that legendary -9.5% day
* its called DIX

Thank you for listening, my aderall has worn off and I am going to take the dog out.

“186,831,051 shares of New DraftKings Class A common stock are issued to the DK Equityholders applying a 0.3546 exchange ratio, and 393,954,594 shares of New DraftKings Class B common stock are issued to Jason Robins, 40,861,997 DraftKings Class A common stock are issued to the SBT Sellers, applying a 1,001.5 exchange ratio there will be an aggregate of 313,077,942 shares of New DraftKings Class A”

Bloomberg shows 313mm as the equity float with a $6bn market cap, is that correct? It seems like there is a ton of dilution not being accounted for based on the current share price.

1229,DD,Twitter:,14,g7sshs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7sshs/twitter/,32,1587846852.0,"Thesis:
TWTR is totally and utterly fucked. Twitter will have its ad revenue hit with an axe because they are currently the worst positioned of any major social media company and ad spending is getting cut across America. They have benefitted from being around longer, but they are now getting their lunch eaten by the new kids on the block - SNAP / PINS - and a recession is just going to pour fuel on that fire

Outline of DD
I) ARPU by social media platform and implication
II) Comparison of platforms
III) Valuation 
IV) The pubes growing on Jack Dorsey’s face

I) ARPU
Social media companies make all of their money from shoving advertisements in front of eyeballs. The amount they make is expressed in average revenue per user (ARPU). Below are the rough rates each company generates in the US
FB: $150
TWTR: $50
SNAP: $15
PINS: $10

Why this matters?
Facebook is the gold standard and has the best ad targeting (because they know everything about you and listen to your microphone) so they can charge the most. Adver

You’ll notice the huge difference between TWTR and SNAP/PINS - this exists because twitter has been around longer and built more and deeper relationships with advertisers. Not because it generates better returns for advertisers or shows more ads than SNAP/PINS. So now, in a world where advertisers actually have to pay attention to how they are spending their now limited budgets, they are going to see that TWTR is overpriced compared to the other forms of social out there. So this leaves them in the most vulnerable position to lose ad dollars.

II) Comparison of Platforms (from Advertiser PoV)
FB: they know more about you than you know about yourself. They are always going to be the top dog and Zuck will be lizard king for life

TWTR: OK targeting, but not close to FB. They also can’t really push more ads because the feed is already like 30% ads at this point

SNAP: OK targeting (but improving). They have a LOT of still unsold ad inventory. They also have the best positioned platform for targeting Gen Z / Millenials

PINS: Phenomenal as platform. Upper middle class white women fucking get off on building lists of shit they want to buy on Pinterest. Still very young and will steal dollars from TWTR / SNAP over time 

Point being - Twitter might have been around longer, but the platform is just average. They have nothing special to offer like FB, and now they have two better platforms offering advertisers a significantly cheaper way to reach eyeballs. They might have been ok when the economy was thriving, but now that they will face scrutiny they are going to get fucked

III) Valuation
Market cap is $22bn. Revenue is $3bn and not really growing much anymore. You don’t get a 6x revenue multiple for a mature business that isn’t growing double digits percent annually

This was priced in a bit, but stock has rallied back and popped when SNAP reported better than expected numbers (all social media rallied on SNAP earnings). But what we learned above is that TWTR is not snapchat. 

IV) Jack Dorsey is a little bitch 

TL;DR - Twitter fucked

Position - buying a variety of short dated Puts next week as earnings are a week from Monday. Expecting disappointment as results won’t be as strong as SNAP. Also buying some longer dated 2021 deeper OTM PUTS

Surely it will tank this time.. said every autist on this sub. This post is to hash out the bullshit and decide a direction once and for all because I am sick of seeing comments on the daily about it. 

If you haven't noticed so far, fundamentals don't mean dick. Any company that does moderately well in this current environment and can sing a good tune will get shot into outer space. Just look at SPCE. It has nothing to do with overall valuation and everything to do with safe places to store money.

In the old days this safe place would be bonds. However, with the current situation at hand the impetus is on moving money slowly back into securities. Fund managers are looking for companies that won't go tits up in the next 3 months and they are watching the numbers closely. So, when companies like SNAP don't completely bomb on their numbers they become the next Zoom and fly into orbit.

SNAP is the bullseye right now and even though it is a shit company and shit app it will continue moon for no other reason than it beat *some* estimates last week, has a decent technology edge, and makes sense at this point in time. If you go against this you'll get your nuts in a vise and you'll have nobody to blame but yourself. 

That being said, it's probably not a bad idea to hedge because Spiegel is a total twat. The time to short this dumpster fire will be soon, my brethren, but it is not now.

Cash flow from Boeing Global Services is tanking along with the airline industry.

New product development was put on the back burner with the firing of CEO Dennis Muilenburg and replacement by David Calhoun.

Boeing 777-9 demand was shrinking before the COVID-19 crisis. It’s worse now. Product development now has ground to a halt. There are no New Market Airplanes, no “NMA Lite,” no Future Small Airplanes in the foreseeable future. There are no customers. It will take years to recover from the virus crisis.

This means Boeing’s future for this decade, for better or worse, relies on getting the MAX recertified and deliveries restarted.

The need for access to Embraer engineers and Brazil’s lower cost base, for a new airplane, is over—for now.
Paying around $5bn for a company that has a market value closer to $1bn is problematic, which the market already knew. Assuming Boeing takes federal money, however the deal may be structured, and that would present huge political problems if Boeing sends $5bn to Brazil.

Boeing’s near-term priority is saving itself and rebuilding its balance sheet. It’s hard to see how Embraer fits into this.

The 2020 decade is going to be Boeing’s lost decade.

The market knew this merger was not going to materialize, because simply put Boeing could not afford the merger. So the analysts are already saying BA built a narrative with other excuses, and now ERJ will take legal action, and at the very least it will cost BA a hefty termination fee. The bigger issue is that longer term this puts Airbus in a much better competitive position, as the failed merger gives Airbus an advantage.

TL;DR:
There's no joy or excitement for Boeing's stock, relative to the failed merger. Any stock advance Monday or Tuesday will probably be faded, and is another selling opportunity before the crushing blow in their earnings report on Wednesday.

Looking pretty long in the face. Wanna tell old Duncan what’s bothering you? What’s that, you YOLO’d your mom’s life savings on SPY puts? Now she has friends over every night, and they’re saying bad words? Well champ, some mommys like being called those names. Maybe she cries in her room after they leave because she is still sad about Joe Exotic going to jail, I dunno. 


Lets be honest champ, even if Robinhood did let you buy puts with good boy points, mommy has almost certainly margin called your GBP account too. Lets see if I can show you a little DD, that might make you some money, and maybe help you look at price targets in general a little smarter.


So, maybe you read an article that says the auto loan industry is about to go tits up. “Great”, you say, “I am going to short the nations’ largest subprime auto loan company, Credit Acceptance Corporation ($CACC)”. But mommy won't stop bringing home dates with that shallow thinking. 


Now the US auto loan industry divides its loans by FICO score. At the top are Super Prime, all the way down to Deep Subprime. Super Prime gets the best interest rates, and are the least profitable loans, and at the bottom are the Deep Subprime, borrowers with poor credit histories and therefore, extremely high APRs, usually between 15% and 19%. However, despite huge differences in the interest rates, almost all buyers end up with the same monthly payment:


**Tier/FICO/Monthly Payment Average/ Share of Auto Loan Market**

Deep Subprime/<500/ $490.50/3.9%

Subprime/501-600/$493/15.95% 

Nonprime/600-660/$486/18.36%

Prime/661-780/$472/42.12%

Super Prime/781-850/$448/19.66%

But wait, each tier defaults at different rates! As of December, before the ‘rona, default rates were already elevated

Dec 19 Delinquency Rates

* Deep Subprime/Subprime--8.18%

* Nonprime--2.89%

* Prime--1.15%

* Super Prime--0.25%

Now, we can use the delinquency rate to offset the average monthly payment for each group, and then multiply it by its share of the market, like this:

**Monthly Payment x share of balances x (1-delinquency rate) = (“Monthly Payment Index”)** 

Then just add each Loan Tier Indices up to get an estimated index score that represents monthly income in December of 2019 for a typical auto loan company. In this case it's 461

Now, we need to know what is going to happen in a crisis. In 2010, at the bottom of the collapse of auto loan industry, we saw default rates increase 45%.


Delinquency
* Dec. 31, 2010 **5.27%**

* Sept. 30, 2010-4.83%

* June 30, 2010-4.84%

* March 31, 2010--5.01%

* Dec. 31, 2009--4.92%

* Sept. 30, 2009--4.68%

* June 30, 2009--4.47%

* March 31, 2009--4.35%

* Dec. 31, 2008--3.94%



So if we assume this crisis will also increase the already elevated default rates by 45%, then we can run our Loan Tier Index again and compare it to the original score. This will give us an estimate of the losses the auto industry can expect from this crisis. That new index score is 455


Surprisingly, we find that because the industry has actually most of its loan balances with Prime and Super Prime buyers, that spike in auto loan defaults will change monthly revenues by just -1.28%


But, Duncan, what about CACC? Don’t they focus on subprime buyers? Specifically with buyers with credit below 660? Yep, so lets run the same analysis, but for just for 660 and below credit scores. We find that their revenue hit will likely be -2.7%.


Thats...not too bad. 


So now let's look at share price. Currently, CACC is trading at 270 with a P/E of around 7.8. However, TTM EPS in December 2019 was around 34.66. If we assume that EPS will take the same hit as revenue (-2.7%), we see that EPS drops to 33.7. If we assume the stock will return to the lower end of its historic P/E ratio of 10, that puts its target price at $336 per share, so at its current price of $271, it is actually worth **buying calls**.


Now, I won’t go into the balance sheet analysis, but CACC's debt levels are real low and their cash on hand will sustain them through a rough quarter or two. 


So, lets think deeper than the algos. CACC specializes in subprime auto loans. No doubt, they will have an increase in defaults. But in the last crisis, their share price continued to rise. Why? Well, its because in an economic crisis, people who used to be prime auto loan customers, suddenly start to miss their mortgage, miss credit card payments, and generally tank their credit scores. Suddenly, their banks won’t give them a loan, and CACC steps in. In a crisis, CACC is poised to make tendies as a lender of last resort to the droves of no-longer-prime buyers. 


So there you have it little buddy. See, by taking your time, looking past the headlines, and running the numbers, your mom won’t be the only person in the house making money by doing two D’s at once. 


CACC 4/21 (or longer) 335c

Equity markets are coming off a 4-week bull run after plummeting to temporary lows on March 23rd. The three days following March 23rd, SPY made a quick rebound and rallied over 40 points or nearly 20%. The rally seems to have temporarily topped out at around 285, or a 30% rally from lows, as investors await a huge upcoming earnings week from some of the largest tech companies in the world. The ‘Big 5’ or FAAMG(Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google), who now account for nearly 20% of the total S&P500 market cap and 90% of S&P500 earnings growth in the past few years, are all set to report earnings in the upcoming week (along with 140 other firms in the S&P500). It will most certainly prove to be a volatile week as this anomaly has only occurred two other times in history, both followed by sell-offs the following week. Moreover, the S&P500 is now more concentrated than the 2001 dot-com bubble Below is a schedule of when each of the ‘Big 5’ will report, along with their expected move based on options premiums and implied volatility.

# ‘The Market has Bottomed’

In addition, SPY has traded within a 10-point range for the past 2 weeks, another sign this rally is fading and the market is turning. For those that believe ‘we’ve seen a bottom’, market bottoms rarely happen as abrupt as the price action shows. A 20% rally in just 3 days? The S&P trading at levels it was at just a year prior as we enter a global depression not seen since 1929 and potentially worse? It will certainly take some grinding lower in the next couple of months before we begin to settle into any type of bottom. With all the current uncertainties still out, markets will take some time to digest the data of the economic downturn.

# The Fed Fights Back

Despite everything happening, it is clear that the Federal Reserve along with the Trump administration will do almost anything necessary, including; buying junk bonds, touting drugs without any prior research as ‘breakthrough cures’, and a whole bunch of other actions that should make you cringe,  to keep markets from crashing. The Fed is also scheduled to have a meeting this week with a press conference to follow on Wednesday. No action is expected from the Fed so anything that comes out would be a surprise to markets. Most likely, Powell will discuss the programs being implemented to ‘stabilize monetary policy’ as well as any new updates to these programs. A few days ago, the Fed came out with a statement providing it will issue updates at least every 30 days about details on these operations. These are said to include 1) Names and details of participants in each facility; 2) Amounts borrowed and interest rate charged; and 3) Overall costs, revenues, and fees for each facility.

In conclusion, with the ‘Big 5’ all reporting earnings this week it will prove to be a volatile fight between cold hard economic data and the Fed/Trump administration in just how quickly the market will turn.",2020-04-27 02:12:18,0.9992,0.0,0.3546631205673759,0.45128770685579195

The current disruption will change how we eat, work, shop, exercise, manage our health, socialize, and spend our free time - at an unprecedented rate of change.

Restaurant's are already planning on introducing robotic waiters to reduce the transmission of the germs since they don't see a vaccine being developed within the next 12 months. 

Contact free deliveries will be huge for the next 1 to 3 years and this trend will likely outlast the virus.

Amazon is already seeing a crazy surge but let's be real, they are a trillion dollar company. It might take a lot more to see that thing move. But APRN is only 147 million dollars and it has another chance to grow thanks to Covid 19. 

Here's my case:

Restaurant visits have dropped next to zero.

No one wants to go to grocery stores for fear or exposure; in 2019 the total grocery sales in America was close to 700 billion.

The average American spends roughly 2 to 5k eating out per year.

In 2019, restaurant sales amounted to 900 billion dollars.

If Blue APRN can capture .001 percent of that “dining out” revenue then their quarterly revenue will jump 1,000 percent. This doesn't even include the rev stolen from grocery stores. We know people 65 and older are fearing for their life and will be very willing to order meal kits rather than stepping foot in grocery stores which are germ factories.

Lastly, screw Hello Fresh. We ordered it and the meal wasn't as good, took longer to make, and we had to supply 20 percent of the ingredients.

In reviewing the play I wanted to make, I decided early last week to create the plan and run with it. General belief being we would rise, then begin a descent. Not knowing when the descent would be, I wanted to average into the rise, putting progressively more of the money allocated to the play in as we rose.

**On 4/21** I FOMO'd in. This was a mistake (#1), and something done against my better judgement. I deployed 29% of the play's capital into this mistake, another mistake (#2). To exacerbate issues, I bought 5/30 puts, another mistake (#3), and wish these were 6/30 or 9/18 buys. In hindsight, I should have trusted my own DD, and waited for the rebound, also should have allocated no more than 15% in my initial buy, and the initial buys early on the way up should have been longer dated, finishing with the early dates.

**On 4/22** I had recognized the FOMO, gotten frustrated with own ineffectiveness, and wanted to be more mindful. I deployed another 22% across two buying windows. Neither perfect, but both fit the general play.

**On 4/23** I deployed all remaining cash, 49% of total play. These buys were mostly 9/18 puts, again in hindsight I made a mistake (#4) in the way I played the dates, one that exacerbates initial losses and will make decisions around modifying harder and more costly. There are a few other mistakes mixed in as well.

All told I deployed 29.34% on 4/21, another 21.56% on 4/22, and 49.1% on 4/23. I'm allocated 14.62% to 5/29, 45.14% to 6/30, and 40.25% to 9/18 puts.

# Terrifying, You Silly Normie! Now what?

Now I look ahead. I talked last time about each day being a coin flip, normalizing to the macro reality over time. I talked about a head and shoulder's pattern, and news being straw on a camel's back. I think the market is moving to a CRITICAL week. My belief is this week is either going to break us out of channel, sending us to test the 290-300 range and seeing me exit this play at a significant loss ... or ... we'll break channel lower, which I see as more likely, but not guaranteed. Let's look at some key aspects:

* [Housing Market Forebearances](https://www.ccn.com/the-housing-market-is-edging-dangerously-close-to-a-1-trillion-reckoning/) \- The housing market saw 500k loans go into forbearance in a week, a 9% jump, taking a total to 4.1 million people unable to pay their mortgage on about 1 trillion dollars in principal. Needless to say, not great.
* The Fed - They meet this week, negative interest rates are on the table, they're the bull saviors, and it's going to be an extremely interesting meeting. I expect an in-channel Monday. Tuesday we ride.
* [DIX, GEX, VIX](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7x0ub/dix_gex_and_vix_an_analysis_by_a_degenerate/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) \- Things are shaping up bearish. Terrific write up on these indicators. This is not a guarantee, but it's something.
* Kim Jong Un - No one want's further global destabilization, it's been nice for the past 6 months with North Korea mostly quiet. Adding fuel back to this region isn't a positive, things are also still inconclusive, but there's a ton of smoke.
* [Tech Earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g4q8u6/daily_discussion_thread_for_april_20_2020/) \- Is this a buy the expectation sell the earnings setup? A HUGE percentage of the SPY's market cap reports earnings this week, and it's going to set support, or kick out a critical prop.
* Oil - Is anyone really surprised?
* General News - Disney closed until 2021? Georgia opening, Trump drives a bus over them? Sniffing clorox as treatment? Boeing backing out of merger? Upcoming GDP numbers, pending home sales numbers? The list goes on.

Bottom line, there's a lot of straw.

# Coiled like a spring in our channel

The market doesn't know which way it's going. I've made my bet, let's look:

[Extremely Tight](https://preview.redd.it/9y7gepbyhqv41.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fd9b8ab2edbaaa1460440fd3cfb6f6186968fe4)

Look at the channel we entered on 4/9. We had a test up, a test down, and otherwise played between 276 and 284. The market is waiting, coiling, and you're going to see significant movement this week, so whatever direction you believe in, place your bets now. I think Monday stays in channel, the fun begins mid-week.

GOOG reports earnings on 4/28, they got out ahead and slashed their advertising budget by 50%. Hmm. A company driven by advertising, slashed their advertising in half. I don't expect a lot of positive vibes here. Expect Facebook to be in the same boat. Discover detailed [a nasty drop in consumer spending](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/24/discover-card-ceo-details-drop-in-spending-with-travel-down-99percent.html), I don't see that playing well for Apple or Tesla. Even Amazon, I'll be watching their business with curiosity. I think things shake out well for them long term, but I don't expect things to be all roses in the short term, I think they're going to have a hard time meeting the expectations the market's set for them.

My belief is the coiled market makes a run to the top of the channel (284-287), and collapses on itself like a dying star, exploding out to the downside, back to test the low 260's. I'm not much a fan of Forbes, but I will steal some graphics from [a recent article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2020/04/23/the-crash-of-2020-is-todays-oil-chart-tomorrows-sp-500-chart/#5e6addce73ec):

[Possibility 1](https://preview.redd.it/3qz9tf70iqv41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30ff3ba92aca172c5c55646afbae4984c16ff7c8)

[Possibility 2](https://preview.redd.it/56r3yfk1iqv41.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a26360c8279b60c7c1f1ae182b96e2c6d7e52f2)

My macro view fits the latter graph, as is likely obvious. But I recognize the possibility of a test downward, the bulls eating enough straw to keep the camel standing, and a firm rebound to the upside. I find it hard to see a third possibility where we immediately use the coil to push out of this channel to test 300, but while no visual for it, I accept it as a possible outcome.

I knew I wanted to run this play, and set out to do just that. I have regrets, could have deployed better, but have no qualms about detailing and making the play. It's going to be a crazy week.

# Updates

**4/27 @ 8:30** : QE dropping to 10 Billion a day.  Everyone looking for a catalyst, look at the dollar.   Also advertising spend guidance in earnings, retail indicators from earnings.  We tested the top of the channel in futures, bounced hard.  u/cowpunk52 talked about the 61.8 FIB level at 293, his terrific chart below, if we rise out of channel, will be very interesting to see what happens at 293.

[cowpunk52's chart, he's had good DD](https://preview.redd.it/t3u5pwe3iqv41.png?width=1079&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1bc609adc37950db3e62d1e31214070ac09ec1d)

**4/28 @ 10:30 PM** : Today not a great vibe.  Strong support hit EOD at 285.5.  Google earnings notes:

Hiring reduction ongoing, also a cap-ex reduction mostly due to no additional office build outs (real estate is going to take a beating all over).  No formal forward guidance, but mid teens decline on average, Youtube end of march deterioration is less yet still high single digits.  Early signs users are returning, but not clear how durable or monetizable, hasn't got worse start of Q2, but brand advertising continues to decline.

Q2 likely a lot worse, though no one will care if they can announce positive trends pointing to revenue returning.  To early to say, but I don't think they're in for a good year.  Might not matter for my play, there was enough wait and see optimism that I expect tech advertising to sustain for a while.  FED and more tomorrow, gonna ride it out, but I think we test upside again and try to break 291.5

**4/29 @ 6:30** : Today is going to be interesting.  I don't believe the FED cuts rates, I've come to the mind they'll say nothing, and say it with positivism.  I'm curious what guidance will be on QE taper, will they hold at 7.5b daily?  Anything below that could spook the market.  I don't believe earnings will be the catalyst I hoped, but we'll see.  With a lack of guidance, it's hard to see the true impacts, and that may not gain clarity until Q2 earnings, and even then, positive sentiment about Q3 would be enough.  Earnings just aren't going to be a leading indicator, especially sans guidance.

2850 is a big support for the S&P, set from 4/16's highs.  If we could crack 2850, we've got downside momentum to retest the 4/15 and 4/23 supports at 2755.  Unfortunately, in the near term, I think it's more likely we test the upward momentum, which will retest the strong resistance encountered at 2900, breaking through that gives us upside towards 3000.  cowpunk's chart above is the best bear case you can form from such a test, but there is danger here.  Continuing to set further highs and lower lows is generating additional support lanes making the near term bear case almost impossible towards any true retest of lows, barring a covid resurgence (which could happen via Georgia / Florida).  You could instead see theta own the day, 3000 prove a strong resistance and top, then a lot of sideways channel trading until the bleak macro economy takes hold and we start a slow, painful, drip by drip burn down to re-test lows.  I'll be waiting a bit more, but conscious this play is likely coming to an end.

4/30 @ 8:30 : The reality for me right now is I feel this play has failed.  I've turned my focus to how do I exit it.  To that end, I am stuck in limbo.  I will likely have something that goes up on Sunday talking about how I exit a failed play.  Currently, I'm not expecting to just fully sell, rather, I'll be looking at when to sell and what avoids extending losses, but also aims to minimize given upcoming market expectations.

4/30 @ 1:45 : I bought a very small \~$100 call position as a hedge given I'm holding this play through the weekend, 5/1 strike, will sell tomorrow at open regardless.  Hedging against after hours.

5/1 @ 9:30 : Call hedge did it's job, wanted protection against Amazon.  Speaking of which, more thoughts later, but glad they had a bearish earnings, even though it candidly wasn't all that terrible, the sentiment was unachievable.  Think we might test 288 early today, will see if anyone wants some badly OTM calls.  Would love to see us break 283 today.",2020-04-26 23:32:26,-0.9999,-0.5719,-0.1511538081107814,-0.5743179360369272

TSLA - few weeks ago they announced they are on target deliver so that is bullish. But I am more bullish on the order.  Yeah - the economy is down yada yada yada- but listen, most TSLA buyers are tech savvy. IBM killed cloud services last week so did intel in data services. That means that commission check needs to be spent y’all. 

BA - is the largest exporter of US dollar wise. Good news/bad news I think it will go up  JPowell- somehow they will find a way to bump this shit up. It’s American symbol of success.  

AMZN . Yeah they are hiring left right for warehouse and stuff but that is expected maybe even priced in- NFLX 15 mil news subs cause they stuck at home. Most also would like to get their product shipped quicker so sign for prime membership. If 1/3 of NFLX sign prime yearly (5 mil) that alone is about 1.7$ per share gain. 

But the money is in the cloud services- Zoom and NFLX use amazon cloud. And from why TSLA will explode you saw how intel and ibm did on the AWS core business. So yeah I am very bullish.

Here is what needs to be pointed out for the average person reading  this- if your net worth is lets say 4 figures, then when you write that  VZ put, you are putting yourself all in. You have just YOLO wheeeled  like a total retard. If you are worth say 100k, fine sell a VZ put or 2,  if you think that it is a good trade.

Some  investors are so dumb that they spend their whole lives picking up  pennies while trying to avoid the steamroller. Instead they could just  pay up and drive the steamroller (Levered long the market plus fat tail  protection).

I've  never approached trading like ""oh boy I cant wait to enter a wheel  trade"" you might as well just slap yourself and quit if thats the  mentality you bring to this game.

It seems that a majority if not all of these transactions are released in the form on a VISA Debit card. If I just roughly do some retard math, the minimum monthly amount in those VISA cards would be in the $35 Billion per month into these accounts.

**Overview**

* The charts still looks bullish, albeit somewhat less so than last Sunday. Needs to consolidate more this next week and stay within consolidation trends

**Weekly**

* Volume decreasing - what you expect to see in a consolidation
* onBalance Volume trending higher over the past 5 weeks which means buyers still have slight advantage
   * This might be the strongest indicator of ongoing bullish movement
* Huge vacuum opportunity to 30SMA
* This last week sellers were in control so need to see a reversal here in the next couple of days or the sell off may continue
* Concerns | Looking at it from the other side: 
   * Is this a continuation Pennant? Bear flag? Maybe...

**Daily**

* Ranges have mostly been 3-5 pts with the largest being about 8pts
* Consolidation clearly happening with a slight ascending triangle
* 14 SMA Crossover (bullish), although need to watch how this curves very closely over the next couple of days
* Would expect mostly sideways days with smaller and smaller ranges
* Cycle seems to be a short boost up followed by days of decline - 4 days up, 3 days up, 2 days up, (1 day up followed by 2-3 days of decline ?)
* Not shown - But my squeeze indicator study is saying we’re definitely in consolidation - Volatility is decreasing and it’s showing we’re nearing a critical point.

**H4**

* Confirms Daily with a bit more resolution
* Nothing new that I’m seeing here other than more gradual decrease in volume and more clear seller control over the last few periods

**Alternative Viewpoint -** Bearish

* Is that just a big fat bear flag/pennant?
   * Heading toward what price though? Valuation has already priced in a shitload of bad news and determined price to be above 89, when everyone thought the world was going to end. BA is an institution and supported heavily by the Gov’t and I doubt they would let it fail
* Have buyers run out of bullets? 
* The company will not come out of this better/stronger/faster?

**Wild cards**

* Could BA have a stock offering which would dramatically decrease valuation?
* Earning can’t look good, this will likely drop price further, at least in the short term
* More bad news...

**Volatility**

* What about VIX eating at premiums as the uncertainty continues?

#Understanding The Market

No one understands the market, but there are some very broad rules of thumb that the market tends to follow. One of them is that the market tends to go down with uncertainty more than anything else. You can take the recent dips: One came when a single drug was found to maybe not be super effective against COVID, and another happened when Oil went into a freefall. The market recovered fairly quickly, but the dips had less of a real-world impact than the uncertainty surrounding them.

I know we joke that bad news means green because stonks only go up, but the reason the ""priced-in"" memes have some weight is because the bad news is already accepted, and the world banks have tapped their cheat codes to prop things up.

The thing is: banks can't solve all the real world problems.

#Things Banks Can't or Won't fix even with Infinite Cash

Oil was another domino in the collapse, but why did the banks not just use cash to fix it? Because the problem wasn't cash, it was physics. Cash doesn't just buy space to keep oil, and buying oil doesn't do shit if you don't have a place to put it or people to consume it. In theory they could just dump it in the ocean or burn it, literally burning the cash they used, but they won't do that. They would just as soon let the whole thing work itself out while pumping money into the market.

Commodities are much more difficult to manipulate because you're dealing with something that is real and takes physical space and actual labor to produce.

My point is that there are things that infinite cash cannot address, and if they are addressed (e.g. burning oil bought with infinite cash), you're probably going to see your dollar become useless anyway. There's an economic breaking point where you will Sophie's choice the market vs real-world issues, and the Fed has already shown it will chose the market.

#Understanding the Virus

A lot of places in the US are getting itchy to reopen as our measures appear to be working. The thing is: COVID isn't going to just disappear. No one expects it to, but the way things are playing out, we are likely going to see a significant deceleration of cases in the next several weeks. The result will be a political nightmare to keep things closed. Wait until someone suggests cancelling Football and the South will start a civil war.

So, given the path we seem to be taking, expect it to be politically adventageous to open the country in the June-to-August range. This will see people get sick, but we're going to likely sacrifice Nana to the Economy god ""for the good of the country.""

What will happen, then, around October? A couple things: One is that the virus may have more staying power with cold weather. It will now be mostly dispersed in the population rather than isolated to a few hot spots, and with the globe open again, it will have a chance to come back harder than before. This is something that is likely ""priced-in."" But, there are two things that are likely not ""priced-in:""

1. The Flu

2. Congress

#The Flu

Constantly being compared to COVID is the fucking flu. I'm not going to go into detail as to why the comparison isn't really relevant, but flu season is basically baked into society.

I can tell you that hospitals, at times, get pretty crowded when it comes to the flu. Certain seasons can hit critical care units pretty hard. You can't predict how bad the flu will be year-to-year, but I can guarantee you that this season is shaping up to be a humdinger. You thought COVID was bad? Combine it with a peaking flu outbreak. Suddenly you have a resurgent COVID running in with the flu, and all sorts of speculation is going to happen with ""how bad is flu season going to be this year??""

#Congress and their shitty stimulus

Congress has shown its hand in doing what they have always done: giving money to people who really don't need it, and leaving workers the honor of footing the bill after getting the crumbs.

Right around election time, the state of the country is going to likely be at the forefront of discussion. If we're open for a few months by then, there will be bitching about closing for no reason, and accusations that we opened too soon. This bitching will likely be marbled into other discussions for how their massive stimulus bills benefited X people when they should have gone to Y people.

The result is that congress, around October/November, will likely be super hesitant to approve more stimulus, even if the need arises.

#A Perfect Storm

If COVID went to zero tomorrow and the global economy reopened, there is likely going to be a chain of events that would happen in fairly rapid succession:

First, the historic unemployment levels will likely be very slow to reverse. Many have already stated here that businesses are very likely to use this time to ""trim the fat."" What better opportunity to cut staff than to simply not rehire them? This lag is going to be exacerbated by the fact that businesses are going to be scared to add more expenses to their books after the recent downturn. This hesitance will snowball as service industries are likely going to have a significant drop in customers with people still hesitant to gather in large groups. The spending power of the populace will continue to drop and businesses that were expected to bounce back, won't.

This is likely not going to be addressed by the Fed because it will be at the worker level. It would have to be addressed by Congress, who I just mentioned would likely be politically hesitant.


#Back to the Market

So, what does this all mean? Uncertainty.

You have an economy that just reopened, a virus that will start coming back, the flu season starting, a congress that had diamond hands, an unemployment ATH which is not rapidly reversing, and to top it all off, you have the election.

All of this isn't even accounting for possible commodity collapses, interruption of supply chains, and already collapsing shipping industries, all of which are likely going to peak in the future despite being disrupted now.

The only way the Fed can keep the Market afloat long-term is to literally nationalize stocks, at which point you should probably just invest in Gold.

TL;DR: Uncertainty breeds crashes+Volatility. We're comfy now with the idea that we will return to normal in a few months, but a lot of sparks are in front of us that are likely to start new fires.

i have a lot of notes but just going to hit the highlights here, i welcome any thoughts from anyone who knows the industry tho.

**business model**

-- it's a very simple one: customers are given short-term (30 - 60 days) loans based on the assessed value of a product which they post as collateral (jewelry, electronics, guns, whatever). these loans are super expensive (good for pawn shop), and if they're unpaid, the collateral is sold at a ~40% markup (great margins).

**thesis:**

-- High unemployment and economic uncertainty will increase demand for pawn loans as consumer credit availability shrinks in a recessionary environment. 

-- credit risk is extremely limited given modest LTV, 100% collateral loans, and 30 – 60 day credit terms (vs. months – years for subprime lenders). also, collateral from unpaid loans turn to high-margin retail sales -- credit risk is really just inventory pricing risk

-- $FCFS is down 25% from YTD high and 36% from 2019 high and is poised to break out of ATH in the next few years. however, there's more room to fall short-term given uncertain timing of reopenings w/r/t COVID-19, liekly additional stimulus, and continued moratoriums on debts/bills/other consumer liabilities

-- the stock has been punished in the face of gov't stimulus, which has reduced demand for pawn loans, and COVID-19 fears. however, long-term, demand for pawn loans should come back strong and 98% of stores actually continue to be open.

**what i like**

-- YTD performance has been great. retail sales are up 30% in April (!!), granted, mostly from products for working-from-home and gaming consoles and the like

-- pawn loan business is super high margin and should increase in share as subprime lenders tap out

-- domestic units are not mall-based

-- positive SSS through '08 crisis and incredible stock performance coming out of it

-- historically a very good operator and integrator. some of the stats on the CashAmerica acquisition are great (e.g., retail margins at those stores increased from 33% to ~40%). this company is very big on inorganic growth so this is really important

-- ample liquidity ($80mm cash, $200mm available under RCF, highly liquid inventory) and significant debt capacity under existing credit agreement

-- these guys love their share buy backs, and the debt documents are pretty generous in allowing buybacks. program has been temporarily suspended, expect it to come back strong mid-to-post recession (if not sooner...)

**what i dont like**

-- pawn shop market is highly fragmented, low brand equity, low barriers to entry (but also who gives a shit)

-- regulatory risk as socialism becomes more popular and negative sentiment towards consumer predatory practices grows

-- more stimulus + continued moratoriums on bills reduces demand for pawn loans. i see this as very short term tho.

-- LatAm and FX risk. Most LatAm stores are really in Mexico, a market i admittedly don't know well. the plus side on FX is most foreign cash is re-invested locally, it just translates to lower earnings in USD

For all the retards out there uso doesnt track oil prices but this doesnt mean you cant use this to your advantage. First of all the downside of this etf is priced in for the month since the next futures contracts expire at the end of may. So from now until then the price should remain stable unless we get a yemeni airstrike in called onto saudi aramco. Anyway what are good ways to trade flat stocks. First is the tried and true Iron condor and the second for the more autistic members is the iron butterfly.

The second strategy is to trade the volatility in the oil futures sector by buying and selling uco and sco. They both are 2x indexes with uco capturing upside and sco capturing downside. This probably is the easiest way to make some decent cash off of the oil futures market.

The third way might be too much of a big brain move for you retards but it is to wait for it... buy put credit spreads on etfs that actually track oil. This is all assuming you have a bullish assumption on the future of oil. Unless we solve fusion energy the etfs to look for are xop,ieo,pxe etc

Dude is a financial analyst. Works for a big company run by a turtle without a shell, master of disguise looking ass dude. Got into an argument. This motherfucker thinks this is the optimal time to invest in the economy. This dude is showing off his 10% gains and explaining why he's investing in oil right now. I get into an argument with him about how Hump and Dump Donny has manipulated the markets this past month. He denies it, says all the bullshit you expect to hear, ""unemployment didn't surpass expectations, Trump is just being Trump, and the Market is forward thinking.""

I just wanted to point out this anecdotal case study, because I think this is how most people think. No one truly believes we are in an economic crisis. No one truly believes the government is manipulating the stock market. No one truly believes we have a problem. Everyone thinks we've already moved past the worst of it. Especially people who write articles that retail investors consume. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

For those of us who analyze financials, leverage, and forecast scenarios... it doesn't matter. Just because you make the smart decision doesn't mean it's the right decision. We like to say we're autists, but if 99 SPEDS out of 100 all believe the market will go up, the market will go up. Just because you're right doesn't mean you'll make tendies.

TL;DR: Amazon will be at least $2500 by 5/01

Past Q1 Earnings:

Amazon has excelled in quarter 1 earnings for the last 4 years.

2016 Q1: 

· EPS: $1.07 vs. $0.58 estimated.

· Revenue: $29.1 billion vs. $27.99 billion estimated 

· AWS: $2.57 billion vs. $2.53 billion estimated 

2017 Q1:

· EPS: 1.48 vs. $1.12 estimate,

· Revenue: $35.7 billion vs. $35.3 billion estimate

· AWS revenue: $3.66 billion

2018 Q1:

· EPS: $3.27 per share vs $1.26 per share estimated 

· Revenue: $51.04 billion vs. $49.78 billion estimated

· AWS revenue: $5.44 billion vs. $5.25 billion estimated

2019 Q1:

· EPS: $7.09 vs. $4.72 estimated

· Revenue: $59.7 billion vs. $59.7 billion estimated

· AWS: $7.7 billion vs. $7.7 billion estimated

Let’s look at how the market reacted AH to these earnings:

2016 Q1: +12% 

2017 Q1: +4.7%

2018 Q1: +7%

2019 Q1: +1%

Analysts are predicting an EPS of $6.35 and Revenue of $73 Billion for 2020 Q1

Amazon has exceeded EPS by an average of 81.59 % in Quarter 1 earnings in the last 4 years. Revenue has been beat by an average of 1.91% in Quarter 1 earnings in the last 4 years. The years that had the highest next day movements were the years that had the largest revenue beat. I believe the revenue in this upcoming earnings report will surprise everyone. Amazon, in the past month, has hired an additional 175,000 employees to keep up with the demand. In 2019, Amazon had 798,000 employees. Amazon increased their employee count by 21.9% in one month. There is a direct correlation between revenue and number of employees. The revenue per employee for Amazon in 2018 was $359,671 or $89,917.8 per quarter ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/217489/revenue-per-employee-of-selected-tech-companies/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/217489/revenue-per-employee-of-selected-tech-companies/)). Another source lists it as an additional $75,000 in quarterly net online sales per new hire ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazons-175000-worker-hiring-spree-suggests-strong-first-quarter-sales-despite-covid-19-analysts-say-2020-04-27](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazons-175000-worker-hiring-spree-suggests-strong-first-quarter-sales-despite-covid-19-analysts-say-2020-04-27)). This is suggesting an additional $13.125 billion in the Quarter 1 revenue. This is not even mentioning if AWS surprises. 

If revenue surprises analysts, Amazon will see $2500 this Friday. BuT iT’s aLreAdY PrIcEd In",2020-04-28 05:13:03,0.9638,0.0,-0.4068744791666666,0.18564184027777783

1336,DD,The Cheesy Collapse of Papa John's & Domino's Pizza,22,g9bqqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9bqqw/the_cheesy_collapse_of_papa_johns_dominos_pizza/,40,1588058065.0,"In a podcast, former founder of Papa John's, Papa John, breaks down the current economics contributing to delivery pizza's rally in the current COVID environment. Check out the full clip [here](https://youtu.be/s4sPpzSWtEw?t=3932).

**Factors Contributing to the Rally**

1. People are not dining out and are consequently ordering more pizza delivery & takeout.
2. Oil prices are extremely low = lower gasoline prices = fewer costs to deliver pizza.
3. Cheese prices are very low. Cheese contributes to 30% of the cost of making a pizza.

Together, these factors are increasing the demand for delivery & takeout pizza and are also simultaneously reducing the cost of goods for pizza delivery services, making them more profitable. This has resulted in a rally for PZZA and DPZ. But when will it end...

&#x200B;

**So Why Short Pizza Delivery?**

1. The stay at home orders will soon be loosened, leading to more people dining in. We may have some time still for this to be fully realized, but it could happen in a month's time. Especially in states that haven't been very severely affected by COVID.
2. The price of cheese is not sustainable at $1/lb for the dairy farmer. They break even at around $1.65 - $1.70 / lb.
3. Everyone will be driving again and oil demand will stabilize, increasing the price of gasoline and the cost to deliver pizza.

**It's All About the Cheese**

Currently, cheese is less than $1.10 / lb ([source & chart](https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/dywacheese_cmebl.pdf)). Milk is perishable within 3 days time. So, as the price of cheese falls, the dairy cattle are sent to the slaughter as the current supply for cheese far exceeds demand and more money can be made on selling beef than the cheese the cows produce. Once the demand for cheese stabilizes as people are getting out and about, the price of cheese will skyrocket to $2.50 - $3.00 / lb as the supply of dairy cows cannot be quickly increased to meet the new demand.

From the USDA's most recent report on cheese ([here](https://mymarketnews.ams.usda.gov/viewReport/1059)):

>Report 17 - Released on April 24, 2020  
>  
>Cheese production varies from plant to plant, region to region. Milk availability does not.      Cheese plant managers are managing output against the widely accessible milk supplies. Some      are cutting back, working on projects and updating. Others are running six and seven day      workweeks. Spot milk prices ranged from $6 to $8 under Class for the second week in a row.      Some cheese producers have reported upticks week over week in food service demand, but when      compared to previous years, the differences are noteworthy. Retail orders are somewhat busy,      as cheese market prices are so low customers are less hesitant to take on a little extra.      Regarding storage, multiple contacts report cold storage is and has been a concern. As      inventories grow, some cheese producers are looking to age/store cheese loads and wait for      greener market pastures. **All said, cheese market tones are bearish. Market contacts hope to      see some corrections posthaste, as some states are looking to, or already have, begun to lift social distancing restrictions.**  
>  
>Information for the period April 20 - 24, 2020, issued weekly  
>  
>Secondary Sourced Information:  
>  
>**The weekly average price for CME barrels is $1.0255, compared to $1.0115 one week ago. CME  blocks’ weekly average is $1.0310, compared to $1.0080 last week.**

And from the previous report ([here](https://mymarketnews.ams.usda.gov/filerepo/sites/default/files/1059/2020-04-13/173316/ams_1059_00056.txt)):

>Cheese inventories are growing for the most part. There are some positive reports from cheese producers who are primarily shipping into retail channels, **but many cheese producers are growing concerned about storage space**. Some food service demand is reportedly growing      slightly week to week, although when in comparison to previous years, sales are noticeably      slower. Other contacts have said that even weekly changes are on a downward slant.      Production, in those plants that are running regularly, is active. There are some plants  closed for longer-than-normal holiday breaks, while others are closed to use this time for plant updating/maintenance. Milk is very available and wholly discounted on the spot market.      Reported spot milk prices in the Midwest was $8 to $6 under Class III. **Cheese markets are      some of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.**

We are starting to see an upward trend in the price of cheese ([here](https://mymarketnews.ams.usda.gov/viewReport/1601)). For a 40 lb block, the price increased by $0.12 / lb for a 40 lb block and $0.0425 / lb for a barrel of cheese. We may be heading for a spike in cheese prices soon.

**When Should You Go Short?**

Papa John's uses approximately 2.5 million pounds of cheese a week. Today, that means their cheese expenditures are approximately $2.6 million / week for cheese compared to $5.0 million / week when the cheese hits $2 / lb. **The business model of Papa John's is no longer sustainable once the price of cheese hists approximately $2 / lb**. Consequently, when you see cheese hit $2 / lb it is time to short Papa John's (PZZA) and likely Domino's (DPZ) pizza.

This is for 4/25-4/27. I’m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem ""important"" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

&#x200B;

I have seen a lot of predictions of where the market is headed in the future. Most of them have been complete shit written by idiots that don’t even know that you can exercise an option. There have also been a few that have got me thinking. What is the most reasonable thing that will happen in the coming months? Now I’m not writing all of this myself. I am combining the thoughts of many people and my own so do not take this as the gospel. 

&#x200B;

**The Markets Future;** The most likely thing to happen is that whenever we, as a nation, reopen there will be a large rise and then a second drop once everyone realizes the destruction that shutting the economy down has caused. The reopening of everything will act as a shot of adrenaline. People will come out of their homes in droves to go to the places they loved before the pandemic. These people will be on their way to businesses that are no longer open. Half of small businesses only have enough money on hand to last 27 days in the event of no cash flow. This is in the event of them being open and paying employees so we can stretch it out a little bit but they still have to pay utilities and rent. According to these figures, most small businesses can only last, at most, around two months. As we approach the third month of shutdown we can be sure that a good portion of America's small businesses will not survive. 

&#x200B;

Our small businesses make up 45% of US GDP. If even 25% of small businesses close that would translate to a loss of 2.3 trillion dollars. When people realize that the businesses they relied on are all closed, mass exodus of the stock market will ensue. People do not want to invest when they fear not being able to make their next rent payment, or God forbid their cell phone gets shut off. Humans are emotional creatures. Fear will override any sentiment pushed by the government. They can say that they are bailing out companies, forgiving debt nationwide, and giving out free blowjobs but nothing will stop a recession with small businesses shutting down nationwide. 

&#x200B;

So here is what I believe will happen. The market will continue to go up. We may not hit the highs we saw before the drop but we will get up there. It will rise because people see that the virus is slowing, we are beating it. Then we will open, and within a month we will drop and that will be the beginning of a recession. Again, do not take this as gospel. This is just what seems most likely. Calls still work and will work until a date is confirmed that we will open. Puts will work on individual companies but not market wide like they did in early March. 

&#x200B;

This is not the type of write up I usually do but good DD was scarce this weekend. The remaining DD I have will be short but a worthwhile read. 

&#x200B;

**WING;** Wingstop is one of the few plays for this post that looks decent. Their revenue has been rising however their net profit has been declining exponentially because of growing interest on their loans which went up from 5M to 17M in two years. They only have around 74M in assets which is more than 5 times less than what they are liable for. Their only growth strategy is to open more stores, the CEO dropped 36,000 shares, and no shares have been bought by executives in the last 12 months. These figures should be enough to tell you that Wingstop will go down. The next question is when and I can not tell you that for certain. If you want to buy in now, buy long puts for next quarter (June/July). I, myself, am going to wait a couple months and watch it develop so save this post so that you'll remember. [Read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7z3qq/the_dumpster_fire_that_is_wingstop/) for more information.

&#x200B;

**HTHT;** Huazhu is a hotel company based in China. Puts on hotels are not really a monumental discovery but something about this has caught my eye. This is a play that I am skeptical of myself but [read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7yq8r/calling_all_autistic_investors_htht_puts/) and come to your own conclusions. I do intend to buy a few $25p 5/15 just because they are cheap and the volume is immense. It mirrors what happened with LK in a scary way. 17,000 put options at $25p 5/15 were bought on April 22 for this ticker. The post that got me interested goes into much more detail about why they are likely to sink from their price now ($30.56) to below $25 so if this peaks your interest too then I recommend reading it and deciding for yourself. 

&#x200B;

**SNAP;** There is a much better write up [right here for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8zme2/lets_talk_snap/) but I will summarize it here. Snapchat is not making much on ads and the advertising industry gets fucked during an economic downturn. Their expenditures scale with the amount of users active and because of the shutdown use is up, while the ads are going to go down. The bull in me says, “Its Snapchat, it'll be fine”, but the bear in me says, “Companies which derive most of their revenue from ads will do well in a downturn.” Take what you wish. I am staying out of this one as it's hard to call which way it will go. 

&#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** Economy open= Market down, Wingstop is a shitshow, Huazhu is sketchy, and Snapchat is a gamble. Read previous posts for more plays that are still viable and can make you money since this one was a little sparse.

**Plays;** Watch for a confirmed open date and then buy puts, WING puts for June/July, HTHT puts at $25 for 5/15, SNAP puts maybe for late May/June.

[NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/23/842807177/pandemic-shutdown-is-speeding-up-the-collapse-of-coal?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=nprblogscoronavirusliveupdates)

Arch coal is the second largest coal producer in the US. And one look at their charts shows they were struggling before COVID came to play. We can see that for the past several months their stock prices have fallen by at least $7. Today their revenue and EPS forecasts were [downgraded](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arch-coal-inc-nyse-arch-121046986.html)

I think things will continue to get worse for several reasons

* Continued [renewable energy growth](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/renewable-energy-outlook.html)
* Natural gas will continue to [decline](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/natural-gas-price-prediction-prices-drop-on-annual-inventory-estimate3s-645883)
* Average summer temperatures for coal heavy parts of the US

Most of the coal-heavy parts of the US are expected to have average summers. For the most part, the few sections of the country that are going
to experience the hottest summer are also less coal dependent states (e.g. the pacific NW, which relies heavily on hydro-electric) with the exception of Texas. My point is that while the temperature won't necessarily *hurt* their bottom line, it won't be helping it this year.
The image below compares summer temperature projections with coal usage by state.

All of this doesn't even factor in the decrease in demand caused by all of the businesses shut down right now.

I know of Utilities that have been pro coal for decades that have been swapping out coal for Natural Gas and renewable energy.
I predict the price will fall to at least 13.5 a share.

Almost all industries were full steam ahead with investment. Carnival was building their largest ship to date, new US shale oil wells were coming online all over the country, and even GE looked like they were on the mend with their new CEO. The worst news in corporate America was around Boeing forgetting that they should train pilots when they design a new plane. Our president was in the news for saying things like we were going to buy Greenland but ultimately reassured the markets that recession fears were unfounded. That day the S&P 500 closed at 2847.11

Fast forward 9 months to April 27, 2020. The US unemployment rate is likely already higher than 20% and is in spitting distance of the record 24.9% that was set in 1933 during the great depression. A pandemic ravages our cities and the elderly, a pandemic caused by a germ we know so little about that our president suggested injecting bleach into our veins to treat it. The travel and entertainment industries sit in ruin as nearly all humans stopped traveling or leaving their house. Oil was priced at negative $40 and projections of June delivery have been forecasted as low as negative $100, the entire US oil industry is effectively bankrupt. Our basic food supply chains have been so taxed by the virus that shortages are projected to begin within two weeks. From a business perspective a near worst case scenario has occurred.

In response, bank's capital requirements have been cut to 0, The Fed has employed all emergency programs used during the great recession at faster speed and greater depth, and congress has passed unprecedented levels of aid. Despite these steps, it doesn’t change the fact that companies will fail, jobs will not return quickly, and we are now in the steepest recession in US history. What little forward looking guidance companies are willing to offer is all negative and even the rosiest analysis indicates negative worldwide GDP growth. Today, April 27, 2020, the S&P 500 hits 2879 or 1% higher than August 2019.

Today bed bath & beyond is about 30% up which even with all of the good news surrounding them to me seems far too bullish and a great opportunity for the pop that inevitably happens. Personally I'm thinking that far too many people are excited about a good earnings which doesn't yet take into account the economic impact on people's wallets. That will come more in the second and third quarters as the impact of the missed payments and debts hits people. However I am by no means anyone worth listening to when it comes to options and was hoping that some of my fellow autists here might have some hot takes.

Everyone right now is working from home jerking off on company time.  Kids are playing games with their friends, and their parents are demanding they use headsets so they don't have to hear it. 

If the parents didn't have a proper desk setup before, they do now, and either their company or they themselves bought keyboards, mice, and webcams to enable it.  If the kids didn't have a headset before, they do now, and once their Turdle Beach headset breaks, they are going to buy something with a bit more quality.

Now, who makes all of this?  Logitech.  They are in a great position to capitalize on all fronts this quarter, and the evidence seems to show they have.

Let's take a quick look through their website.  Here are their webcam offerings.  Ones I've crossed out are out of stock:
https://i.imgur.com/iMBYKvD.png

Yeah, every single model is out of stock, even the $200 ones.  Bestbuy.com is sold out of all but the $170 model, Walmart.com has most in stock but at immense markups.

Now, you may say, ""But you can get CHEAPSHIT brand peripherals from Amazon for only $10!""  Yes, you can, but it seems Logitech as a brand name has immense pull.  Even the resale market for Logitech webcams is having a shortage.  For example, the C310, a long-discontinued model sold for less than $20 new and under $10 used on ebay back in February:
https://i.imgur.com/0okHo4J.png
Now look at the sales from this week:
https://i.imgur.com/RGjnPy3.png

If CHEAPSHIT brand truly were good enough, you wouldn't see used prices on decade old Logitech webcams increase this much.  People want their Logitech.

But what do Logitech's numbers say?  Let's take a look at their last quarterly report: https://i.imgur.com/Jxzu3I5.png

Last quarter PC webcams were only 3.5% of their net sales with a YoY increase of just 3%, but video collaboration was 10% with an increase of 24% YoY.  Video collaboration products are their very expensive camera systems, but now with some offices returning partial workforces, both PC webcams and collaboration cameras will have a massive increase in sales to facilitate meetings.  Gaming makes up over 25% of their net, and we all know the spike gaming has seen.

So, in short, Logitech is gonna rocket off once their quarterly earnings are out on the 11th.   I know this would have been better to post two weeks ago, but there is absolutely still time to get in.",2020-04-27 22:21:45,0.9986,0.0,0.25666165803108815,0.41842055267702943
1361,DD,Are the anecdotal reports of huge traffic at Home Depot and Lowe's stores reflected in the stock price? A quick DD on a possible earnings play,24,g965yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g965yu/are_the_anecdotal_reports_of_huge_traffic_at_home/,27,1588040311.0,"Tl;dr A lot of people have noticed the massive crowds at Home Depot and Lowe's of late.  This past weekend I did some Google Trends DD to see if that's really showing up numerically somewhere.  I found that HD and Lowe's are both at **all time highs** for search interest, with trends since February comparable to Corona plays like Netflix and Amazon, except more linear.  It's worth noting that unlike those stocks, HD and Lowe's haven't yet recovered or exceeded their pre-virus prices, although they have had a bit of a run-up today and Friday.


[Home Depot and Lowe's have seen a steady, sharp increase in search activity since March](https://i.imgur.com/1YAZ8zK.png).  In fact it appears to be an all-time high, even more than the holiday season.  And HD/Lowe's are pretty insulated from the Amazonification of shopping- a lot of their stuff is convenience based, or bulky items, or stuff you want to check out in person.

[Compare to the CV19 All-Star stocks Amazon and Netflix, along with Wal-Mart to compare to Amazon as a retailer](https://i.imgur.com/H1F4Kn7.png), there is a similar but more linear uptick for the home improvement stores.  And AMZN/NFLX/WMT stocks are at all-time highs.

[Etsy, Ebay, and Wayfair have seen upticks in search activity similar to the hardware/home improvement stores](https://i.imgur.com/lO7oop7.png).  (Side note, in contrast to these, Poshmark took a severe hit during the onset of the outbreak- used clothing not so hot during a virus outbreak I guess- although a recovery seems to be underway). However, their stocks have mostly already recovered their pre-corona prices.  Still some room to run possibly, if you think the landscape has permanently changed in their favor.  eBay especially has potential to challenge Amazon in online retail if they can get on the right track.

Just for comparison to Wayfair, HD, and Lowe's- [nobody much cares about Bed Bath and Beyond right now](https://i.imgur.com/wBXgwgt.png), which is just as well since their stores are closed. 

Bottom line, the hardware/home improvement stores are tracking the hot internet stocks in terms of search interest and anecdotal feet through the doors, yet their valuations have lagged.  I wonder if the markets are overweighting the loss of construction business.  This could present an opportunity for HD/Lowe's to surprise at earnings, which is really what an earnings play is all about.

Been playing oil and USO, made out well on some smallstreetsbets but am getting ulcers from the price swings as futures contract near expiry, USO halts 5 times per day, trump alludes to war, etc etc. Looking to settle down with a nice upward trajectory.

The constant in the ""Oil fucked"" market is supply and storage. Not a new concept on wsb, but I was surprised when I got in at such low premiums. I've already made good tendies and I know that by posting here I'm willing this market to destroy every dollar of gains, but I've lurked long and gained and want to pay it forward. 

**NAT (tankers, for the truly retarded) is on a consistent rise for months, the issues with crude supply mean fundamentally it should only continue to rise, it didn't dip when the market did and shouldn't when the market dips again, and it's trying to be the popular girl among tanker tickers**

A few important factors in the next two months:  
\- June prices are about to take a big shit, hence USO rolling past June contracts preemptively to [slow their inevitable implosion](https://i.imgur.com/5Cf851d.jpg). Demand for storage will increase.  
\- Brent June contracts expire 4/30 , already seeing [the dip](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/brnm20?countrycode=uk)   
\- WTI June contracts expire 5/18, the same day as NAT earnings. Earnings are gonna be so Big Dick, that this on top of an inevitable bottom-price, potentially negative (though not as negative) future price is gonna make the news, which we sell.  
\- Brent July exp soon after, 5/29

Oil prices up oil stocks up?? Etf down?? Up???? Who fucking knows. But oil prices go down BECAUSE supply is too high, and that isn't changing, and even if it does, futures will maintain demand for storage. Something about mangos. Every time oil dips below $10 we are gonna get more news, and people will throw money into tankers.

Why NAT and not $MYBOYFRIEND'STANKER ?  
Because they keep talking about [how big their dick is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8) on fucking cnbc, and if I've learned anything about this market, it's that dumbshit groupthink and popularity is as important, if not more, than any fundamentals.

Activision Blizzard has been on a run since relative low at $52 in March, having peaked at $81 in 2018. Any gamer knows COD:MW has been immensely popular since its release and even more popular with the release of Warzone in March. It was second to only League in twitch viewership in March as seen [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/509814/leading-games-twitch-by-number-hours-viewed/) (even beating Fortnite). I don't think boomers have accounted for just how popular this game is. And it definitely hasn't thought about what ATVI is doing with its Blizzard segment working on WoW Classic.

Looking at the most recent filing we see that ""Bookings"" fell from 2018 to 2019. This metric includes an important focus of ATVI: shifting revenue into a more recurring model. How are they doing this? Microtransactions - that's right, the same shit that made Fortnite rich. And as of now, Warzone is blowing Fortnite out of the water, so guess who's selling more skins? The drop from 2018 to 2019, even with games like Sekiro and COD:MW (no Warzone yet) helping the business, shows how important bookings is, not just AAA titles crushing the market. What games drove previous bookings? Destiny and BLOPS4. Today we have Warzone and WoW Classic is back (WoW is moving through Blizzards old expansions - Burning Crusade was the most popular expansion ever and its coming soon to WoW Classic) which I think are going to blow the 2018 bookings numbers out of the water along with some other titles. Other things to consider are that in 2018, King segment was banking on boomers playing Candy Crush, I bet they are back for more these days. But also, COD Mobile [blew up](https://www.businessinsider.com/call-of-duty-mobile-downloads-revenue-first-week-2019-10) and has more opportunity to support revenue growth as well with Warzone out now. And even if things with the beervirus improve and venues continue to open, things won't just be back to normal - we are looking at a new trend of spending more time at home and online.

Another interesting point comes with the release of MW2 campaign remastered. Probably not going to be as huge as Warzone and the bookings argument, but this is a AAA title considered to be the best of COD in many people's hearts and it did not receive much if any media attention because it was a surprise drop. 

Devil's Advocate: Release of Valorant (Owned by Tencent) has blown up [recently](https://www.twitchmetrics.net/games/viewership). April numbers show Wow and Hearthstone are still beating Animal Crossing though, which is Nintendo's biggest release. And COD:MW is still high up, slightly lower than Fortnite, perhaps implying Warzone players are more suggestible to what's trending, while Fortnite kids provide a more stable viewership. 

TLDR: I think ATVI is successfully shifting its business model to capture more recurring revenue (microtransactions, subscriptions) in all 3 of its business segments and stabilize more of its revenue stream against cyclically releasing AAA titles. New normal will provide further growth opportunity, hopefully Valorant and other titles don't cuck our tendies, but I think numbers and guidance will be positive.

Data: See the chart below:

\- Gold/Silver and Platinum to Silver on LEFT axis, Gold/Platinum on RIGHT axis.

\- Light blue shaded areas are recession months.

Analysis:

\- Note TRENDS INSIDE the shaded areas, and TRENDS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING the shaded areas. This shows what has happened inside a recession and what has happened after the recession.

\- Note areas of spread compression or expansion between trends. This gives you a timeline for the moves.

\- If we assume that some metals (i.e. GOLD) are more influenced by speculators than others (i.e. PLATINUM), platinum seems to be a proper baseline for projections.

\- G/S should zig-zag for a while, then come down (Yellow line).

\- P/S should come down soon (Grey line).

\- G/P should zig-zag for a while, then come down (Blue line).

Conclusions (TL, DR), which of course, are not financial advice:

\- Short P/S ratio.

\- Short G/S ratio

\- Short G/P ratio.

\- G/P to P/S spread should narrow significantly after P/S makes a move down.

\- The above do not account for all the printing and changes on industrial use of the years, so trade accordingly. This is important because it either artificially affects prices or affect supply and demand of each metal.

\- Note that P/S hasn’t moved yet, so monitor the trades (I would be Delta neutral until this thing starts to move), hedge volatility, and save for Uncle Sam. Or do otherwise, I don’t care.

**TL,DR: CERS 5/15 6C**

**COMPANY BACKGROUND**

Cerus Group is a medical device manufacturer in Southern California. They primarily specialize in blood, platelet, and plasma purification procedures. Now, normally their services aren't usually in too high demand, as most blood donors are pre-screened for diseases or other ailments. However, with the COVID-19 crisis driving governments and companies to find a cure, it puts Cerus group in an extremely advantageous position. Because COVID-19 antibody rich plasma is relatively rare and extremely valuable to study, labs cannot afford to screen patients, and considering most patients are older and have numerous ailments, their INTERCEPT procedure is extremely vital to purifying blood plasma in order to isolate COVID-19 antibodies. In fact, a look on their website shows that their process is already FDA approved for isolating COVID antibodies.

With the ramp up in antibody testing as well as an increase in testing, Cerus is expected to not only continue it current run up, but gain momentum rapidly as retail investors begin to pick up the scent. So far, the stock is 90% owned by institutions, a good sign that momentum is yet to pick up with the COVID-19 hype.

**OPTIONS ACTIVITY**

On Friday, the 5/15 6C experienced an option volume of almost 5,000, representing a number of shares equal to almost a third of total daily volume. Open interest on the morning sat at 2000, indicating that there was significant opening of positions. Judging by the bid ask spread, most orders were at the ask, indicating aggressive buying. The largest order was an opening position of 1,665 contracts. However, this order's price was smack in the middle of the B/A, which is why I suggest caution entering this trade.

Upon further inspection, the one minute chart indicates that the price increased slightly at the time of purchase of this huge block order. This indicates that the MMs that sold these options had to buy shares in order to hedge their delta. The price increase as well as the fact that institutions like to trade with a trend leads me to believe that the order was a discrete buy order to open, but the price action was so small that you really need to be careful.

**Institutional Thesis**

I believe that the institutions trading this option are bullish on this stock. It's a straight long call, and there was evidence of numerous sweep orders.

On the other hand, there was significant selling of this option as well, which is why I encourage caution and perhaps more analysis and discussion.

I want to hear what you guys think, cheers

QA: Is there still room to run after going up 5% today: Obviously since I'm posting it. Price target 6.5-7

are there risks: Of course. Do your own DD before entering any trade

how is IV: IV was already fucked when I entered the position, so yeah, it's pretty high. But delta should make up for it

Earnings: May 5th. Skewed to the upside. I expect guidance to moon this stock, never before has CERS's INTERCEPT been more valuable

&#x200B;

**DIS 5/15 $105 Call**

Here's why I'm recommending this, if you wanna hear my backing. Walt Disney is one of the biggest companies in the world. To put this into perspective, they own ABC, Fox, FX, Disney, ESPN, Marvel, Pixar, Hulu, and a ton more. **The main things of this DD are Disney+, their upcoming EPS, and how they're undervalued during this coronavirus.** First of all, Disney+. Disney+ has been booming in numbers, before the coronavirus, and with the virus added on, it is literally exploding. Along with its other subsidiaries, Disney is one of the only companies in a better position because of this virus. Yet they lost 31% due to the virus. They should have benefitted. The beautiful thing is (my second point), their EPS is coming up on May 6th. 3 out of the 4 of Disney's EPS's over the past year have had a positive suprise, and this one will obviously have a huge one as well. Zacks estimates that they will have an EPS suprise of 14.7%, I believe it will be a lot more. And finally, combining all of this, they should really be up 30% instead of down, and this upcoming EPS will prove that, and I believe the week after their EPS will be as green as the Rockefeller Christmas tree. I'm getting excited just writing about this. This is no joke, seriously, don't know how I can be more serious, the best opportunity I have seen in my life. Trust me, and buy a new car later.

My reasoning for 5/15, is I want to not only capitalize off of the immediate response to the EPS release, but also the week after, as I believe the market will take time to realize that it made a mistake about Disney.

Fanduel is  a part of a larger profitable company. DKNG is overvalued and Fanduel is undervalued. DKNG will probably be a meme stock anyways, markets are fake.

Beloved DFS (daily fantasy sport) and three state Sportbook operator Draftkings went public on Friday to much screeching in this sub. Their combined market cap is \~5 billion dollars. If you remember the 2015 nfl season you remember there is another DFS provider, Fanduel. In 2018, Fanduel got bought in a shady backroom deal by Flutter Entertainmenr (PDYPY) leaving the founder of the company with zero dollars. PDYPY is an established global gambling company with the leading market share in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and has hundreds of retail stores across the UK. This conglomerate, which is profitable, has a market cap of 8 billion dollars. Not only are they an established company, their Fanduel brand is beating Draftkings in the both the DFS and legal sports book market. So a company that is the leading brand in three countries where gambling is totally legal, and is beating DKNG in the us is only worth 3 billion more??

Now the catch is DKNG has potential to be a serious meme stock. 30 million Americans unemployed, 2400 extra trump bucks a month. DKNG is going to be like SPCE, they have no revenue since market has been shut down. As we saw with SPCE no revenue is the most bullish indicator a company fan flash. We can see from this chart below that meme stocks initially drop, before a mass of uneducated investors hear about them. Anticipate DKNG to trend lower this week, before launching to the moon in May.

Every autist and his mother knew this was an absurd retard bubble. But some of us didn't have the balls to buy puts, because who knew how long this preposterous bubble, fueled by amateur investors saying to themselves ""hey, everyone's using Zoom! They must be raking it in!""

We knew this was bullshit because ZM is currently trading at a P/E ratio of nearly two-thousand. TWO THOUSAND. Even if you don't believe in any sort of fundamental analysis, you can see that that's fundamentally ridiculous (see what I did there?)

It's ridiculous because Zoom has no way of ever making money. They offer a product–video conferencing–which people don't expect to pay for, in the long run. Facebook announced on Friday that they're going to be rolling out FREE video conferencing for up to 50 people, and you don't even need to have a FB account to use it. Expect Google to join the party soon. 

The only reason companies currently pay for Zoom is because it's the 'professional' way to video chat. FB won't change that, but something clever linked to Gmail will. (Something better than hangouts, obvs). FB and Google will be able to give this service away for free. Zoom has no other products. 

Zoom has no stickiness - this isn't a social network folks. There's no need to acquire this company. People have zero loyalty to it. Businesses aren't integrated with Zoom with an API or something. They just pay a middling 25$ per user fee. Everyone will drop this in a second if there's something better and free. 

The stock dropped dramatically on Friday when FB made the announcement. This week everybody is going to realize everything I just wrote.

Lose money, np, more tax money and pension funds. Wait till main street start to realize what Trump and FED'S up to.

&#x200B;

**Bullish case (mostly for the 2H):**

* Growth stock: gaining new users is always warmly welcomed. Apparently that's what happened two weeks ago.
* If they come unscathed from the months to come, they will remain in growth stonk status once ads start flowing back.
* Might see small pullback from kids going back to school and daily activity diminishing, that may be priced in tho

&#x200B;

**Bearish case (for the next quarter and following 2 weeks too):**

* Ads market is likely fucked (see Google announcement last week, cue Alphabet and FB earnings calls). Less advertisers, less ads on the market. At the same time - more users and activity - eventually less ads (thus revenue) per user as the marketing campaign budget is drained quicker. Excerpt from 10-K.

>***We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of advertisers, or a reduction in how much they spend could seriously harm our business.***

* Snap expense that bothers me: cloud. Cost of revenue was 32% of OPEX last year (rest is mostly employees and facilities). Scales with users. Excerpt from 10-K \[1\].

>*Cost of Revenue*  
>  
>Cost of revenue consists primarily of payments to third-party infrastructure partners for hosting our products, which include expenses related to storage, computing, and bandwidth costs.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>*2019 compared to 2018*  
>  
>Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $97.0 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in cost of revenue primarily consisted of increased revenue share costs of $54.4 million, consistent with our overall increase in revenue. Additionally, the increase was driven by increased infrastructure costs of $37.9 million, attributable to DAU growth and increased user activity between the periods, net of infrastructure cost efficiencies, and increased advertising measurement expenses.

* Time spent daily is growing (though numbers are not explicitly mentioned in snap ERs, but they boast with more time spent on their different modes) = more expenses, quicker drying out of ads, see the pattern here?
* BTW, that shilled user growth is 11M from last quarter. It’s not fucking 50%. It’s 5% (229M from 218M). \[2\]\[3\]

Tidbit:

* FB (Insta), TikTok are not sleeping and Snap position for instant/direct ephemeral messages/stories is not for granted. Hell, FB sent them drilling couple years ago when they pimped Instagram. Watch TikTok do the same. Kids are not loyal to apps, they move wherever there is momentum.

Call it what you want, stonk jumping 40% in value over 5% user growth over last quarter when everybody is locked and (significant) growth in YoY time spent in some of their feature is not normal even for meme/growth stonks.

&#x200B;

**Bottom line:**

Short term, in exact this quarter, might be devastating for Snap. With revenue (ads) likely plummeting and expenses continuously growing, the next earnings call looks brutal to me. I know that 2.5 month timeframe is way too much for you, but you can try to drop some FD poots to possibly grab some bucks from FB/GOOGL flop in ad supply.

**What is happening?**  

At least 12 meatpacking plants in the US have closed with at least 2460 workers testing positive and 17 deaths. A single Smithfield plant in South Dakota [""has reported 518 infections in employees""](https://apnews.com/26bf8fc20f2873d9701fd2ea95f87be4). The situation is so bad that [about a quarter of American pork production and 10% of beef output has halted.]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/tyson-foods-to-indefinitely-suspend-waterloo-operations-k9bbgnr9)  

Meat processing plants are a hotspot for virus because of the close working conditions and a constant spray of water on the lines. Masks are basically useless once they get wet. [Meat workers are 4x more likely to become ill than other manufacturing workers] (https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/04/22/meat-packing-plants-covid-may-force-choice-worker-health-food/2995232001/) There is no way for these factories to operate safely or adhere to social distancing.  

[100 U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors have tested positive for the coronavirus]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-22/tyson-foods-to-indefinitely-suspend-waterloo-operations-k9bbgnr9). These inspectors are very likely to spread the virus to other plants that may not be impacted before they realize they are sick.   


Tyson ($TSN) has already closed 4 of their meat processing plants because of Covid-19 cases while 6 more are dealing with Covid outbreaks but haven't shut down yet.   

**Workers Protection?**  

So how is Tyson protecting its workers? By offering them bonuses to keep showing up to work. [At the Tyson plant in Camilla, Ga, the company offered its 2,100 workers a $500 bonus if they worked in April, May and June without missing a day.]( https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/coronavirus-chicken-meat-processing-plants-immigrants.html) Which may have led to at least 3 deaths including a longtime 15 year employee named Annie Grant. She tried to call in sick but was told that she “had to work to feed America.”   
  


How about the Department of Agriculture? What are they doing to help? [""Rather than increase safety and oversight, the U.S. Department of Agriculture relaxed it in the midst of the pandemic. Just this month, the agency allowed 15 poultry plants to exceed federal limits on how many birds workers can process in a minute.""]( https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/04/22/meat-packing-plants-covid-may-force-choice-worker-health-food/2995232001/)  

Even our Vice President is putting pressure on workers to continue coming to work even without proper protection in place.

That why we dropped in the first place because people tried to price in the outfalls of a global pandemic.

BUT ... the situation now has the ability to increase credit defaults in different sectors, student loan, mortages, credit card, you name it. But those loans couldn't have defaulted yet ...

1.) Most people probably still were able to pay in march  
2.) Most stuff only defaults after 30+ days - (which would take the first defaults to end of april)  
3.) Government jumped in with forbearance, which means we will see the defaults, in a few months

Big money is comfortable holding equities because they can closely monitor default rates, but they will probably FUCK you and dump a lot of stuff when a threshold is reached. So be aware.

Default rates started rising in months before shit hit the fan in 2008, so you really have to roll back the timeframe. We are probably in the ""i cannot sell my house for what I bought it phase"".

Defaults are bad because they obliterate a FUCK ton of value in balance sheets and you don't know what crazy products were leveraged out of the ""this will never happen case"".

[Robinhood most bought tickers last week](https://preview.redd.it/dmhqsovivav41.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0becba9b98ac102706aa05c47978be684f053b)

Let's ignore that idiots are still buying $USO, since I already made a [few](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5smyo/weird_stuff_going_on_with_uso/) [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6zkc1/a_smoothbraineds_guide_to_oil_futures_and_uso/) posts talking about this, or the fact that the 12th most bought ticket is an ETF that is in the process of closing. What drove my curiosity was the action going on with $WLL, so I took a closer look.

[$WLL Robinhood users holding shares](https://preview.redd.it/m27lrnlxvav41.png?width=3492&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f9e83b8123b2bd0545f86bf150a434688411459)

Hopefully everyone reading this already has heard of Whiting Petroleum ($WLL), which is the biggest oil producer to have went bankrupt in 2020, entering [Chapter 11 bankruptcy](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520093737/d899645d8k.htm) on April 1. For some idiotic reason (i.e. ""buy the dip""), retail investors started to pour money in to this stock after that happened, with the number of Robinhood holders going from around 12k users to over 40k users since they've announced bankruptcy, many of them coming in the past few days. This volume of retail buyers has actually caused the price to go surge in price.

[$WLL, Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/0a00v3jnyav41.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=864b91d165c6b9a2cf9d522f83a15172f8ccb922)

In fact, this stock is almost 200% up since they declared bankruptcy, somehow?

They've also recently announced a [restructuring agreement](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312520118310/d922194d8k.htm) with their creditors on Friday, where the bond holders will receive 97% of the restructured company's equity, and the existing shareholders (i.e. the current $WLL shareholders), will only own 3% of it, pending bankruptcy court approval. This means, at the current stock price of $1.22, you're betting that the same amount of ownership in the new restructured company is worth $37.33. Their January highs, before everything happened, was at $8.66. Clearly there's something very wrong going on here, and this is just ""buy the dip"" retail bulls pumping up a bankrupt stock without understanding how bankruptcy work. At best, it should be worth $0.26, if we valued $WLL's post-restructuring market cap to be the same as their January levels.

What's that smell? Money.

TLDR; Profit off buy-the-dip retail bulls, $WLL $0.50p 6/19

&#x200B;

EDIT - I probably should have added this in my original DD, but you can see how much these are really worth by looking at the bond's price. Since bondholders would have a 97% of the equity of the new WLL

New WLL market cap = 0.97 \* face value of all bonds with claims \* price of bonds with claims

All the bonds that are going to be receiving equity are priced at $0.103 as of writing, so with approx. $2.4B of impaired bonds at face value, we have the new WLL market cap implied by bond prices to be at 240M.

Since the old WLL shareholders will receive at most 3% of new WLL shares, we can then say old WLL share value = 0.03 \* new WLL market cap / old WLL shares outstanding = 0.03 \* 240M / 92M = 0.08.

The bankruptcy agreement said that they will have the plan be effective (i.e. old shares discontinued, new shares issued) by September latest, so I would go with an August expiry if you want to be safe",2020-04-27 10:22:13,0.9994,-0.5574,0.08189137931034483,0.17463045977011493

If it works, the market will be optimistic and moon, but the rollout and administration could be a disaster. If you think our country won't botch it, consider buying. If you think our country will botch it, hold cash or get long-dated puts.**

Long time lurker, first time poster. Feels like the week of April 27, 2020 is driven by excitement of upcoming tech earnings, S&P 500 earnings, and therapeutic results for COVID-19 (specifically, Remdesivir). My background is in health economics with a bit of epidemiology. I don't know what the results of the Remdesivir study will show, but there are a few levers to think through when the initial results are released. Also, I'm not a pharmacist or pharmacologist, so I don't understand the details on mechanism of action, etc. (if you think Remdesivir is the silver bullet, please enlighten me).

In this post, I'll describe my personal thoughts on the following areas:

1. Ongoing Remdesivir studies and how to track them
2. Limitations on administration of Remdesivir
3. A couple thoughts on antibody testing press releases

**1) Ongoing Remdesivir studies and how to track them**

[ClinicalTrials.gov](https://ClinicalTrials.gov) is a great website where you can track a ton of clinical studies going on all over the world. I've done the homework for you, so you can click this link to view the ongoing Remdesivir studies: [Remdesivir CT.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=). You'll see the terminated and suspended studies in China at the top of the page, along with plenty of others.

**Study of interest:** Here is the page for [**NCT04280705**](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705), the study we expect results for in a couple weeks. This study enrolled 572 patients at 68 sites, which provides good generalizability. However, there are few things to consider when critiquing the results from this study when they come:

* Inclusion/exclusion criteria:
   * The study includes patients who have one of the following: diagnostic imaging indicating issues, SpO2 <= 94%, requiring supplemental oxygen, or requiring mechanical ventilation. Obviously, **these are four VERY different steps** in the treatment pathway. **Subgroup analysis, and possibly adjustment for confounders, is needed in this study.** Otherwise, we might show Remdesivir works in a biased set of patients/situations since the inclusion criteria is so broad for only 572 patients.

**2nd Study of interest:** The Remdesivir study I'm most interested in is [**NCT04292899**](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04292899?term=remdesivir&draw=3&rank=3), which is a Phase 3 study evaluating two Remdesivir regimens (5- and 10-day). I haven't seen this reported in too many places (except WSB!), but this study increased enrollment from 2400 to 6000 patients recently. This may have one or more implications:

* Remdesivir isn't the silver bullet we were hoping for as a society.
* Remdesivir is working, but only in a subset of patients (likely healthier patients or patients treated earlier in the disease onset).
* GILD wanted to increase access to the drug, so they upped the sample size
* GILD wanted to do a little p-hacking and get a p < .05, so they increased the sample size by 2.5x.

&#x200B;

**2) Limitations on administration of Remdesivir**

Look, even if Remdesivir works (and it might!), it will probably be most effective when given early in the onset of COVID-19. What happens when you call your doctor to get tested today? **They tell you to stay home and wait until your symptoms get worse.** Once you are almost sick enough for the hospital, you can finally get tested.

Here's the issue -- **Remdesivir is only available intravenously (!!!)**.  This means if you contract COVID-19, you will need to get tested early and find a hospital bed where they can hook you up to a 5- or 10-day drip. You likely need to be in the hospital for this because side effects might affect your vital organs (*any doctors in the crowd think Remdesivir can be administered at home?*).

**If we can test early enough to identify these ideal Remdesivir patients**, then patients might clog  up hospitals to get their Remdesivir drip. This should weigh heavily on health care providers (e.g HCA, THC) and elective surgery companies (e.g. SIEN).

**I'm skeptical we will find suspected cases early enough for Remdesivir to be an effective therapeutic.** However, I do think the market will still rise heavily on optimism of a cure before it realizes in early summer that Remdesivir isn't all it's hyped up to be and we still don't have a vaccine (oh, and we still have 16-20% unemployment, etc.). I feel really dumb for fighting the money printer, but I imagine I'll add to my cash or short positions if SPY gets close to 310.

&#x200B;

**3) A couple thoughts on antibody testing press releases**

From my understanding of the antibody testing development and rollout, the FDA provided guidance that companies should manufacture tests with > 90% specificity (true positive rate). However, under an emergency use authorization the FDA has not reviewed the validation data on these tests. There are countless articles stating that many more people have antibodies than we ever thought possible. Here's why that's wrong.

Let's assume the following:

1. Antibody test specificity = 95% (a good test!)
2. Antibody test sensitivity = 100% (wow, this test kicks ass!)
3. Disease prevalence = 2% (estimated rounding 50,000 deaths / 1% IFR \~ 1.4% of US)

If we test a population of 100 people with a test with parameters #1 & #2 above and a 2% disease prevalence, we will expect to find the 2 confirmed cases and 5 false positives. That means 71% (5/7th) of our positive results will be false positives.

**If either: (1) the test is shittier than the one I described (**[**because 90 companies make them!**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/us/coronavirus-antibody-tests.html)**); or (2) the disease prevalence in the locale tested isn't as high, the ratio of false positives to true positives will grow!**

Hell, even the CEO of Roche said the antibody testing is ""[a disaster](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/covid-19-antibody-testing-a-disaster-says-roche-ceo-as-its-diagnostics-sales-rise)""!

We're all making bets as to whether the market will decide to go further up from here in the next month, or we will re-trace the lows. We are reading tea leaves, making and mocking TA, or at least looking at the data we think will be predictive and instructive... Or just guessing. 

**What I think we're missing is the looming hammer of a second lockdown**, **sooner** (with states re-opening *this week*) **or later** (with a serious resurgence this winter, or a mutated new strain of virus anytime). 

There's plenty of effort being made to measure the 'true rates of infection' and using this data as a means to estimate when it's safe for us to come out of the bunkers; the problem is that we don't know:

1) The true number of people infected so far and their survival rates (the ""prevalence"" and ""mortality""), discussed in the article below; it's doubtful we're even able to measure these accurately anyhow. \[Sub-point here: the ""incidence"", the number of new infections we have measured so far, has been *during lockdown*. What happens to the incidence when lockdown ends?\]

2) The potential for re-infection (once you are immune, does it last?)

3) The potential for a new strain of virus (influenza presents with a new strain every year, requiring a new vaccine every year)

What we do know is that there is not going to be a miracle cure - not hydroxychloroquine or any other  already-known drugs (I have a PhD in centered on drug development; fight me!) - and there won't be a vaccine developed *and* approved *and* mass-produced *and* mass-distributed for a very long time. There has been no coordinated federal response, and America is [full of idiots](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-24/anti-vaccine-activists-latch-onto-coronavirus-to-bolster-their-movement) who feel oppressed by keeping others safe. Another lockdown is coming.

**TL;DR:** I posit 90% chance of re-lockdown(s); even if it's on/off and only regional, it'll be in the most economically relevant areas like LA and NY (as opposed to Yeeee-Haw, South Dakota), and this will crush the market.

**Strategy (listen ding dongs):** 

Are you a bear waiting on a drop? Minimize your theta bleeding, make little plays but be ready for when the hammer drops.

Are you a bull watching the market go back to normal? Wondering what could crush an unlimited printer and even hurt the stay-home stocks? [This](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/04/antibody-tests-herd-immunity/610762/).

- increase in searches but less commercial searches (ex. increase in ""sue bae titties"", decrease in ""how much real estate can i buy for 10$"") no surprise there. 

- 30 percent increase in google play downloads. also noted was an increase in user engagement and average time spent on apps from gplay. 

- youtube watching time increased during corona (no surprise) but what's interesting is that people are now using it as a news source. i grew up with youtube and never did, but i noticed that the whitehouse.gov/live feeds were all being hosted on youtube. that's pretty wild.

- sundar mentioned direct response advertising growth on youtube. a quick google search makes it seem that its better than typical advertising because it mines your search history for patterns vs typical ""demographic searches"" traditional advertising uses. 

- decreases in brand advertising. no surprise here. expected to pick back up eventually . 

some interesting notes on their forward guidance. 

- google is definitely seeing a macro shift to digital on things people were sitting on the fence on before (example: virtual showrooms for real estate). also noted a definite interest in WFH from hospital systems (for their IT depts.) etc.

- the CFO also mentioned they would be doing share repurchases (always a good thing) at a similar rate to q4 2019. so that's about 6.4 billion dollars. 

- Google decided to make google shopping free to list on for sellers for the time being. interesting because it seems that they are willing to sacrifice short term rev on this end for long term customer relations. i wonder if amazon is doing anything similar. could give them some headwinds in scaling against amzn. 

- Overall, Corona took away from what was expected to be another strong quarter. The biggest areas which Sundar focused on were google clouds as expected, but more the Gsuite, which is having very strong growth, notably more than their cloud services. it seems that they are positioning themselves well to offer analytical tools to help businesses execute well.",2020-04-29 04:35:34,0.9998,0.0,0.3450058823529411,0.4482686274509804
1429,DD,Activision: Still A Lot More Room to Get Some Sweet Tendies,97,g9za2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9za2w/activision_still_a_lot_more_room_to_get_some/,136,1588149062.0,"As the title suggests, Activision still has a lot of room to grow and surpass all-time highs. I'm going to try to make this relatively short so you autists can digest this.

**Business Model**

Activision was built to thrive in this pandemic; a majority of their revenue comes from in-game purchases. I think a common thing people do is make an apple to oranges comparison between gaming and streaming/subscription platforms like Netflix, but this isn't exactly accurate. With increased traffic, Activision actually stands to profit more and increase their revenues due to the nature of their business model. On top of that, COD was the best-selling game in 2020 and second-best in March after Animal Crossing, and COD Mobile has also picked up some serious momentum recently from the pandemic.

Here's a link to an article where the results of findings on increases in gaming time and in-game purchases are found: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/24/activision-will-get-boost-from-record-game-sales.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/24/activision-will-get-boost-from-record-game-sales.aspx)

**Bullish Signs from Management**

This is going to sound like a silly reason, but I found this to be a good sign from management. Recently, the CEO got a lot of press attention for giving all 10,000 employees his personal phone number. Unless you're a true autist, you don't hand out your personal phone number to your employees if your company is doing poorly or you are about to layoff a bunch of people. Also, Activision is hiring a ton which is always a good sign when we are seeing all these other companies having layoffs.

**More Games in the Pipeline**

Activision is adding to its mobile pipeline this year and planning to release Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 in the future. On top of that, the COD franchise is stronger than ever (it is returning to its old glory). This bodes well for Activision going forward and will definitely show up in their upcoming earnings on May 5.

**Conclusion**

Earnings next week will be a catalyst for it to test its all-time highs, and after boomers realize opening the economy means they can't go to their local Applebee's to sit down with their boomer friends and get drinks, they will want to invest in ""the thing all those young folks do."" Also, this thesis holds true for EA and take-two as well who make a majority of their money as well from in-game purchases (granted less than Activision percentage wise) but you might run into liquidity traps/wide spreads. I would stick with Activision and Zynga (due to its increase in traffic to Facebook).

tldr: more traffic, means more revenue for Activision which means hitting ATH

If you look at NAT fleet they have 23 Suezmax

Oil capacity Suezmax = 1 mb

NAT can only store max 23,000,000 MB

[https://www.nat.bm/fleet/](https://www.nat.bm/fleet/)

Lets look at two other companies for example.

DHT: 27 VLCC (Very large crude carriers)

EURN: 42 VLCC, 26 Suezmax, 2 FSO vessels

So if you look at just oil capacity both these companies dominate in oil storage compared to NAT.

Imo from my DD if your looking at the break even points of VLCC and Suezmax they are only $3000. So my question is am I crazy for investing in DHT and EURN while NAT and others are flying? Lol

This is the ever changing charter rate right now

[https://compassmar.com/reports/Compass%20Maritime%20Weekly%20Market%20Report.pdf](https://compassmar.com/reports/Compass%20Maritime%20Weekly%20Market%20Report.pdf)

This is how much it costs to run these boats at break even.

If you just look at how much they are charging per day for VLCC which is around $150-300k and VLCC break even price is at $27k.

Suezmax break even price is $25k (Couldn't find per day rate for Suezmax because these terms are sometimes very confusing so it's hard to look for)

So if you just calculate per day price of a VLCC then subtract the $27k for cost to run they are profiting quite a bit of money per day right now.

IN CONCLUSION FUCKING DHT AND EURN TO THE MOOOOOOOOON!!! or not who the hell knows with this market right now.

We know this, but as a former bull turned gay bear whose asshole is still gaping from JPOWs schlong, i'm ready to come home, and I want to buy some calls. Pork processing plants have been getting ripped through by coronavirus in the past week or two, forcing shutdowns that you may or may not have heard about. Smithfield foods, the largest pork producer in the world, has shut down 5 plants in the last week or so. It is likely that the same will happen or is already happening to many other food processing plants. These plants are cold, wet, environments and the workers are in close proximity to each other: A wet dream for the WuFlu. 

From this, It seems like there could be shortages of pork as plant processing capacity is lowered. This should lead to an increase in the price of pork, and I don't see why the same wont be true for other meat products. In the past week prices have already risen.

COW is an agricultural ETF that has holdings in lean hogs, live cattle, and feeder cattle futures. As more and more plants are forced to close, the prices of these commodities should go up. If I was not so stupid I might try to play these commodity futures directly, but I don't know how and I only use robinhood like a true degenerate.

The volume on these options are very low, almost nonexistent. Which is why I bought shared on $COW. 

$PPC is a company involved in the production of chicken products in the US, EU and Mexico. As beef prices rise in combination with many people falling on rough times, demand for chicken, which is an inferior good, will rise. The options on PPC have higher volume, but only for certain strikes so again be careful.

Someone tell me why this is an autistic play.

Cruise lines in general can be a risky play because no one knows when the world will re open, and it can be assumed many people will still be sceptical of cruises in general being that this virus is only the newest in a long line of “sickness” problems that cruise lines have had. THAT BEING SAID,

1.much lower volatility pre virus than its competitor RCL making it more of a value stock for big money to dip into post world Re opening

2. When the world reopens I suspect at least a 10% stock spike for any cruize lines that have handled their financials in this crisis well.

3. It’s possible that many young people will want to get out of the house and take advantage of lower vacation prices in airlines, cruises ect. I know I will be booking a flight to LA as soon as airports open.

The launch of a major gaming system only comes around every 7 years (PS3 in 2006, PS4 in 2013, PS5 in 2020). 

PS5 will more than likely be available for the 2020 holiday season with mass production starting in June:  [https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-mass-production-to-begin-in-June-with-simultaneous-global-launch-planned-PS5-reveal-event-could-land-in-late-May-or-early-June.462066.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/PlayStation-5-mass-production-to-begin-in-June-with-simultaneous-global-launch-planned-PS5-reveal-event-could-land-in-late-May-or-early-June.462066.0.html) 

According to this bloomberg article ""Sony remains unlikely to delay the launch of the PS5 from the critical year-end shopping season. So long as archrival Microsoft Corp. doesn’t push back the release of its next-generation Xbox, also expected at the end of the year, Sony won’t delay either"" : [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-16/sony-is-said-to-plan-limited-playstation-5-output-in-first-year) 

With Covid potentially affecting this date Jan 2022 $5 calls seem like a safer option - this will give 2 holiday seasons for console sales to increase as some people will get it right on release and then a bunch more the next holiday season (usually when bundles are released at somewhat of a discounted price). With Xbox potentially releasing it's new console around the same time there is no doubt that GME will moon.

The urgency of this need will be met with an exorbitant price tag. Abbott has already secured [EAU](https://www.medtechdive.com/news/abbott-diasorin-coronavirus-antibody-tests-get-euas-as-lawmakers-question/576794/) for its COVID antibody test while industry leaders remain [complacent](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/covid-19-antibody-testing-a-disaster-says-roche-ceo-as-its-diagnostics-sales-rise). The fact that this development resulted in minimal price movement reflects uncertainty that Abbott can deliver on the scale of its rivals. In this climate of urgency, their ""shoot first ask questions later"" approach to COVID antibody testing will be the winning one.

Abbott has never been considered the industry leader in diagnostic testing. Quarterly diagnostic revenue was only up 0.7% in Q1, the weakest organic performance of their 4 branches. Abbott's ARCHITECT, the flagship of their diagnostic fleet, is a relatively high throughput serology platform that already has a place in many hospitals and state laboratories. They are currently charging over $100 for each COVID antibody test, which is an order of magnitude higher than their other antibody tests. The price point is also uniform, meaning they will charge public labs full price. I suspect that state governments will happily turn over grant money to subsidize testing as their constituents continue to demand seroprevalence surveys and back-to-work initiatives. Better yet, there won't be any public outcry over price-gouging because the IgG test is not used to diagnose active infections in sick patients.

I expect the antibody test hype train to be running at full steam in about a month's time. By then, the positive Q2 results will probably be priced in. Therefore, I will be going in on June monthlies rather than waiting until August for an earnings play. 

As a bonus, there will probably be a jump in RHHBY when they announce their antibody test in early May as they throw caution to the wind and join ABT at the table (no options chain tho, RIP)

**TL,DR: INSM 5/15 $16 / $19P**

**COMPANY BACKGROUND**

Insmed Inc is a global biopharmaceutical company transforming the lives of patients with serious and rare diseases. The company's first commercial product is ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), approved in the US for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. The company's earlier-stage clinical pipeline includes INS1007, a novel oral reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 with therapeutic potential in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and other inflammatory diseases, and INS1009, an inhaled formulation of a treprostinil prodrug that may offer a differentiated product profile for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

**OPTIONS ACTIVITY**

The spreads on these are very wide, so it's not something I would normally even look at. But, the big blocks of puts that went through make it seem like someone knows something. Earnings are on the 30th and I couldn't find any information on any of their drugs with news pending, so it could be a pure earnings play. On both strike prices, open interest sits at 5 and 22 with the volume at 5005 and 5067.  Indicating that there was significant opening of positions.

IMGN is smaller biopharma company that produces a number of innovative therapies, most of which are used in the treatment of cancer. It's slated to report earnings on the 1st, and from past experiences, this bad boy knows how to move on an earnings call.

Now I'm going to give it you straight, from one autist to the next: the last 1.5 years have definitely been tough for IMGN: it's seen a couple of setbacks in its drug testing and its had to restructure to the tune of laying off 75% of its workforce last June. But it's on the road to recovery. Why do I say that it's recovering?

1. It's consolidated into a leaner, meaner, cancer fighting machine that prints tendies: the layoffs were designed to conserve cash that it put right into funding the longer term future of the business and narrow the focus to its most promising drugs
2. It's got not 1 but 2 drugs in the coveted Phase 3 of testing: do you know what phase 3 of testing means, degenerates? No, of course you don't. Do I? No, of course I don't. But the market does, and that's what matters.
3. One of these drugs is in the even more coveted ""pivotal trial"" status: I won't even bore you fucking morons with the details of this, but let's just say this is a big fucking deal, and they've staffed up the trial for it, so hopefully no Covid interference on that
4. It's got momentum going for it: Q4 earnings (the first since the layoff) had a huge surprise when they clocked in positive and everyone thought they were going to lose a bunch of money. I doubt the ship has been turned around since then, I expect to see of this momentum in Q1

If on the 1st they either report an earnings beat or they talk about any even nascent success in the pivotal trial, this motherfucker is going to gap up big time. This shit is volatile and loves a good success story, so get on board before the tendie train leaves without you.

That said, not financial advice, and this is a gamble. Do with that what you will.

Then I thought, who the fuck in their right mind is still eating Tootsie rolls? So I did some analysis on their big brands, I have NEVER heard of half of their candies and the only ones worth mentioning are Junior Mints (which are pretty dope). Turns out they sell a good portion of their Junior Mint candies through movie theaters (fucked), and the vast majority of their yearly sales comes from Halloween (probably the holiday that is the most antonymous with social distancing). 

Their cash/balance sheet seems fine so they will likely weather the storm BUT, you have a flat/declining company with productions that are mostly fucked due to Covid and their biggest sales event of the year likely going to take a big hit.... so HOW THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT TRADING ABOVE WHAT IT WAS IN JAN????

For you all that think it’s too late to get in the tankers, some of these companies are going to put up earnings numbers in Q2 that are 1/4-1/2 of their market cap.

EURN will put up about 3.50eps- stock is 12.20

TNK 7.50eps -25

TNP 2.00 -4 (that’s 50%)

NAT 1- stock price anywhere from 4-20, at this point who knows

DHT- 2.50 -8.30 (going to have a disappointing q1 because they got unlucky in the beginning of q1, as they said in their q4 conference call)

FRO 2.50- stock 10.50

And half the quarter is basically locked in because the ships are chartering for the first week of May at high rates. The day rates would have to crash to alter these projections. Even if rates went to 0 TNP still makes 1/4 of its market cap q2.

The product tanker guys, like stng and asc are even higher going forward, because their rates just jumped this past week. Just today, an LR2 (2 sizes smaller than a VLCC) now charters for more a day than a VLCC. Now this wasn’t all quarter, but if it kept up, those rates would earn stng and asc (who own only MRs) closer to 80%-90% of their stock price every 90 days.

Lastly, every conference call these companies do, they let the analyst know what their average fleet TCE (day rate) is for the quarter to date. If you look at the analyst projections right now, they have not been updated yet. You are going to a get line of upgrades as the q1 conference calls end because of the monster numbers that the tankers have already put up in q2.

To show you how out of date the projections are, EURN has a q2 projection of 1.20.... they earned that in April.

1497,DD,Why $MTCH will be your next 1000% play,88,g9na5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/,123,1588109684.0,"Everyone's trying to play earnings for Q1 and we've seen some great wins and losses so far. The problem is that people tend to buy calls on a stock that has a positive earnings report already priced in and end up losing. An example of a stock that had their ER already is [Dominos](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/dpz). Their price was going up slowly already up until a major sell off after their [very positive earnings](https://www.investors.com/news/dominos-pizza-earnings-q1-2020-dominos-stock/) report. An example of a stock that's currently going through this is [Twitter](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/twtr), as it's price has ramped up 15% in the last week already in anticipation and will most likely fall after earnings in two days (get puts btw). 

The key is to find the 'golden egg' of earnings, a stock with earnings that are far enough out and not priced in yet. A company that has actually benefited from the covid19 lockdown in unexpected ways. Ideally, you want to buy calls on a stock that people in general *do not* think will go up, so that any beat earnings would not be priced in. And you'll want to get into this stock over a week before the report. Take [snapchat](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/snap) for example. Nobody expected it to go up after earnings, this is reflected in it's price a week before the earnings report, falling 10% between April 14th and April 21st. And then when earnings came, boom, 30% up and call holders profited. All of WSB was stunned. 

So I made the call on Snap on the daily discussion thread before it mooned and now I'm here with my next call. Because the earnings graphic for May 4-8 isn't out yet, I made my own [rough one](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g957ph/since_the_week_of_may_4th_to_8th_earnings_graphic/) on MS paint and scrolled through all of them to see what would be a good buy. And I think I found my golden egg. Match or MTCH is an online dating company with web sites serving over 50 countries. A lot of people think they're just match.com but they also own OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Tinder, and Hinge. They pretty much have the monopoly on dating apps. With the covid19 lockdown happening in the states and around the world, people are on their devices trying to socially connect while maintaining physical distancing. *This* is why snapchat soared last week. We can look at statements from Chief Executive Officer Shar Dubey that mentioned clear ""increases in engagement"" among their platforms reporting an increase in the number of conversations that people are having, along with the length of these conversations, which are up anywhere from 10-30% since the outbreaks started in many countries.

Note how I'm making this post a full week before MTCH's earnings on the 5th? I've noticed time and time again that it's always better to do an earnings play earlier rather than later because the price generally runs up beforehand. We're trying to buy in *before* the run up. MTCH is now trading at $78-79 down over 4% from yesterday's high of $82.60. This dip makes it *the perfect time* to buy as I don't think you'll get a better price before earnings next week. The pre-covid peak was $92, and remember, covid19 is *helping* the dating platforms, so I do expect a best case scenario of it getting back up to this value. That would mean a 15% increase. [I'm not into the meme lines, but here's some TA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/MTCH/ycpr8F4h-Making-Love-Over-Video-Chat-Looks-Bullish/) for those who crave it. These indicate a strong buy signal for literally all of last week. 

If that wasn't enough, Match has also changed it's platforms in the wake of the lockdown to make it more desirable. Just like how facebook introduced videochat, their website introduced 1:1 video chat. Match is also making dating advice more available to its users and launched a special “Dating while Distancing” service that includes free access to dating experts. 

**tldr;** MTCH 80c 5/15

Quite the opposite is about to occur.

Investors are being blinded by a Fed who are building a wall of money to contain this credit crisis. Printing trillions hoping this monstrosity of bad policy will be swiftly overlooked, and for the most part it has. Never before have we seen the level of support the fed has been willing to give and investors think that is enough. When the Fed backs you, you keep pumping. Because of the broad nature of the assistance, I believe neither Mnuchin nor Powell know, or care about the actual consequences. They've cast a wide net in hopes that they've solved every problem that will come their way in this crisis. I'm not quite sure if they're stupid, or if they're drinking the same Kool-aid this admistration is pumping out. We all know its bullshit and there is no way we see new highs by Q1 of next year. BOTH Mnuchin and Powell should be on the hook for this; Mnuchin for embezzelment and fraud and Powell for accessory to it. They make Bernanke and Paulson look like choir boys. 

When the reality sets in, and everyone realizes there will be no V-shaped recovery, it will be too late. The bets being placed now on a speedy recovery are the final nail in the coffin and this time, the fed will be completely out of ammo. With rates stuck at 0 for the foreseeable future, and a deficit well beyond our means, the fed will be forced to ask the Congress again for extra powers akin to socialism. There will be no recovery, no rebound, no making whole of the people.

This is the end of The Great Expansion. The end of capitalism as we know it and most likely the beginning of the end of the United States as a world power and the end of the Dollar as the reserve currency. Dark days ahead.

LabCorp Announces Coronavirus COVID-19 Antibody Tests Available Nationwide With No Upfront Out-of-Pocket Costs

4/27/20, 1:12 PM
April 27, 2020 04:12 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Biotech

Locations include nearly 2,000 LabCorp patient service centers including more than 100 LabCorp at Walgreens locations, and thousands of physicians’ offices

BURLINGTON, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LabCorp (NYSE:LH), a leading global life sciences company that is deeply integrated in guiding patient care, announced that beginning today, it will offer antibody tests for the virus that causes COVID-19. There will be no upfront out-of-pocket costs to people who receive an order for a test through a doctor or healthcare provider, including telemedicine providers.

Antibody blood tests offered by LabCorp are administered across the U.S. at tens of thousands of doctors’ offices and at LabCorp’s nearly 2,000 patient service centers, including LabCorp at Walgreens locations. Results will be available to the ordering healthcare provider within 1-3 days after the date of specimen pick up. They are also available to patients in the LabCorp Patient™ mobile app.

Adam Schechter, president and CEO of LabCorp, said: “We are bringing the full force of LabCorp’s science and testing capabilities to serve individuals across the U.S. whether they had the virus or believe they have the virus. We stand with all Americans, healthcare workers, and those on the frontlines who are helping people in need.”

Richard Ashworth, president of Walgreens, said: “COVID-19 response requires collaboration across industries and sectors, and we’re pleased to further our relationship with LabCorp in order to improve access to COVID-19 and antibody testing in many of the communities we serve. By continuing to expand our testing efforts and resources, together we’ll play a critical role in helping to keep our communities healthy and enabling more Americans to return to work once they can do so safely.”

LabCorp began antibody blood testing on a limited basis to high-priority healthcare workers in late-March and currently has capacity to perform over 50,000 antibody tests per day. By mid-May, LabCorp expects to be able to perform 200,000 tests per day as more tests and testing platforms receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

The COVID-19 antibody blood tests detect the presence of antibodies to the virus and can help identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus. While antibody tests are helpful to understand if an individual has developed antibodies and a potential immune response, antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude infection. Knowing a patient’s results might be useful in the determination of important decisions, such as the ability for hospital staff to care for patients.

These tests have not been reviewed by the FDA but are being offered by LabCorp in accordance with the public health emergency guidance issued by the FDA on March 16.

LabCorp is committed to providing critical information regarding COVID-19. Updates related to LabCorp’s response are available on LabCorp’s COVID-19 microsite.

INNVERSE WSB: actually sentiment seems pretty evenly split on this one, but the majority of comments seems pretty bullish on almost  everything but BA, alot of people seem to be getting puts... in my experience, buying puts rarely works out =bears r fuk 


NO DEAL: So we all know Boeing backed out of the Embraer purchase, which was actually a good move according to this random article I googled:

EARNINGS: Everyone expects earnings this week to be bad. We all should know how this works by now

 bad news =priced in.   Stonks go up

 Slightly less bad than expected =to the moon


BAILOUTS: Trump and munchkin have said they won't let BA fail. If the government is gonna bailout banks, commercial airlines, cruise ships, and casinos, Boeing has to be one of the safest companies in the US

BOOMERS: they love BA, price goes down they will FOMO cheap shares.  Hell if I am wrong and it drops <100 I will buy some too. 


BOMBS: Boeing accounts for 21% of the U.S. Department of Defense procurement budget. 
If there is one thing I am bullish on it is the US military industrial complex...

So far in 2020 we have: a dead Iranian general, a quarantine, oil that is worthless, an economy that is predicted to going into deep recession at best, an election year, a random presser about Venezuela narcotics, and Kim probably ded...  there is 100% gonna be some kind of military conflict this year.

In this week's edition of DDDD (Data-driven DD), let's look at what the market's might be heading in the near term by looking at the past few week's price actions, and potential catalysts for the next trend.

**Possible COVID-19 & Lockdown Events**

* China - Lockdowns have been lifted in China, with Wuhan even having their lockdown lifted on April 8. There’s starting to be a report of a second wave starting, mostly imported cases from other countries. Beijing announced a few days ago the closure of all gyms and swimming pools, a sign that they might be starting another series of lockdowns to combat the second wave. Similarly, there has been a recent surge of cases in Singapore as well, indicating that a second wave is coming.
* Europe - The hardest hit countries, Italy, France, and Spain, are starting to see the flattening of the curve after peaking in new cases in late March, with plans to start slowly lift the lockdown in early May. In particular, Italy will start resuming manufacturing on May 4, and restaurants will be reopening on May 18.

[Italy COVID-19 Cases](https://preview.redd.it/59n0t6d7phv41.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=07dc89ee736b6d0b84b05a129b5f5a08d3f7fb8f)

* US - The number of cases in the US seems to be peaking overall, with positive cases and hospitalizations going down in hard-hit cities like NYC. Some states are starting to look at doing Phase 1 re-opening, which would include lifting restrictions on construction and manufacturing. NYC is planning on entering Phase 1 reopening on May 15, with many other states like California likely also doing so around the same time. Georgia already decided to reopen businesses, including higher risk ones such as gyms, and not following the Federal government’s recommended phased approach.

[US Cases](https://preview.redd.it/9s79ee6xphv41.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e5536eff323b66d8e1947f1d073597d327e3117)

* Treatments - We’re starting to see some initial results for trials of treatments for COVID-19, most notably for Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine. There’s been a lot of leaks related to Remdesivir, with footage of a University of Chicago faculty meeting discussing positive results being leaked on April 17. A few days later, a Chinese clinical study showed that it does not have any positive impact on results. [Another study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2007016) was released on Friday showing hopeful results from compassionate use of the drug. Hydroxychloroquine meanwhile has yet to show evidence in being effective in treating COVID-19, and has been linked to very serious cardiovascular-related side effects.
* Vaccines - There are at least 115 known vaccine initiatives for COVID-19 occurring worldwide, with 6 of them having made it to human trials, the stage where most vaccines are discontinued. Despite this rapid progress, most experts agree that we would likely not see vaccines being widely available until the end of 2021 at the earliest. [There’s also doubts](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-may-be-impossible-to-produce-scientists-covid-2020-4) on whether or not a vaccine is possible, as a vaccine for any forms of corona viruses have never been produced, and there’s concerning signs that natural immunity from COVID-19 after being infected is short-lived and that rapid mutations will make it impossible for a vaccine to be developed that covers every strand (i.e. similar to the cold or flu).

**Economic Data**

* Since the lockdown started, there has been over 26M new joblessness claims. It’s likely that this number is underreporting the true unemployment levels as this metric only tracks the number of people who were successful in filing for unemployment benefits, and most state’s unemployment systems have reached capacity in handling new cases. With a labor force size of 165M in Feb 2020, this gives us a minimum of 16% of the labor force that have recently been unemployed. Economists are forecasting the unemployment rate for April to reach around 20%; the ATH for US unemployment was 25% in 1933.
* Q1 GDP growth estimates are all over the place, with the NY Fed predicting -0.4%, WSJ predicting -3.5% and at -15.4%. Q1 GDP will be released on April 29.
* Consumer sentiment, which measures the US consumer’s average optimism in the state of the US economy through spending and savings, is at 72. The all-time low, since recording started in the 1960s, was 52 in the 1970s. Consumer sentiment neared that level as well during the Great Recession.

[Consumer Sentiment](https://preview.redd.it/8b0a3jmyphv41.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=f18866590df0024b3d49db603d7d84d46537d16a)

* The Purchaser’s Managers’ Index (PMI), which measures business’s confidence in market conditions, measured with a variety of factors such as inventory and production levels, is at 37 for manufacturing and 27 for services. A PMI lower than 50 is usually considered to be a reliable leading indicator of an upcoming recession.

* CPI dropped 0.4% in March, indicating a possible beginning of a deflationary spiral. A lot of this can probably be attributed to oil, but commodities across the board are also falling

**Fiscal**

* The Federal government is considering a variety of “Phase 4” stimulus bills, many of which will be significantly larger than the CARES Act, a $2T which is by far the most expensive bill passed in US history. There’s a few bills out there, but negotiations between Democrats and Republicans are unlikely to occur until Congress is back in session on May 4. Here’s the ideas currently on the table
   * A bill to provide a directly monthly payment of $2000 for anyone making less than $130K for the next 6 or 12 months; Costs $450B / month, or $5.4T for 12 months
   * A bill to cancel all rent and mortgage payments for 1 year. Landlords and lenders would be compensated; Will cost between $1T - $2T
   * $2000 debit card issued to all US persons, with $1000 reloaded to it monthly. Will cost $2T, however it will not be funded by debt. Instead, it would effectively direct the Fed to literally print the extra $2T to fund the program.
   * 80% payroll tax cut

**Monetary**

* Balance sheet increased from 4.1T to 6.5T since January. The Fed is now purchasing or lending against Treasuries, MBS, Munis, IG and fallen angel bonds, and junk bond ETFs.

* The unprecedented level of liquidity pumping has resolved the liquidity crunch we saw in mid-March that amplified the stock market sell off as the dollar's value consolidates, for now.

**The Stock Market**

* S&P500 is now 15% below its ATH from February, or the same level as the October 2019 lows. We see the rebound in prices being concentrated mostly in large-cap and technology stocks. The Nasdaq US100 is down only 9.5% from the ATH, and now out of correction territory, while the Russell 2000 is still down 25%.

* S&P500 PE Ratio, using trailing 12 months reported earnings, is sitting at 20.6.

* Over 150 companies of the S&P500 will be reporting earnings this week, including all the large technology companies (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft). Last week, most of the financial sector reported earnings, with a -56% YoY decline in that sector.

* We were in a rising wedge over the past few weeks, which we’ve broken out of last week with no strong price action. It looks like the market has been consolidating between 293 (62% Fib) and 272 (10 year support, coinciding with a key support / resistance level from 2018 and 2019) on SPY for the past few days.
* Volume has also been decreasing slowly since the beginning of the rally.
* MACD is showing bullish, with a zero crossover recently

**Conclusions**

It looks like we’re past the “panic” phase of the shock, where a combination of a liquidity crunch and uncertainty about the future caused a rapid selloff. Fiscal and Monetary policy caused a rally, as price started consolidating towards the channel we are in now. It looks like most investors seem to be holding off from trading while they wait for more information, which we will be seeing over the next few weeks, starting from this week. It’s waiting for some big catalyst.

Things that will cause SPY to fall below 272 and have another selloff

* Q1 GDP, released on Wednesday, is much worse than expected
* Earnings released this week, especially from the companies in the trillion-dollar club, miss significantly their earnings expectations
* Lockdowns in NYC and California get further delayed
* Cases surge in Georgia in a week or two, forcing another lockdown
* Europe delays the lifting of their lockdown
* China completely locks down again
* Waves of large companies becoming bankrupt or insolvent

Things that might cause SPY to rally past 293

* All the lockdowns being lifted, and businesses magically all restart like nothing happened
* One of the treatments are confirmed to be effective across most cases and is FDA approved for treating patients
* A significant UBI gets passed by Congress
* Congress approves the Fed to start buying stocks

I’m personally bearish overall, and think that the catalysts that will cause us to break out towards the downside is much more likely than the upside. In the meanwhile, we’re going to see smaller companies, especially ones with weak balance sheets, underperform.

This week will be important because of earnings and GDP, two key figures that should be basis of a stock's value. If we don't break the channel by the end of this week, SPY will likely stay between 293 and 272 for a while as more COVID-19 data comes in. You can play this by either going #cashgang, #thetagang with short-dated iron condors, or long-dated SPY puts if you want to take advantage of the low VIX and believe (like I am) that we aren't going past 293. If the results from this week is bad enough for us to break 272, the next selloff has started and shorter-dated SPY puts might print. Except for the unlikely case where Congress approves the Fed to start buy equities, it'd be hard to see anything that pushed us past 293 in the short term.

TLDR; If we end this week < 272, SPY 270p 5/15. If > 293, the world has gone insane. Otherwise, selling short-dated iron condors, holding cash, or SPY 250p 8/21.",2020-04-28 09:26:06,-0.9996,0.0,0.08959577259475217,-0.30333474246841596

&#x200B;

United Arlines said they from April 1st - 14th they had 200,000 passengers which is down from 6,000,00 from the same time in 2019 and with an average profit per passenger being $17.25  they made a weekly revenue of 1.75m compared to 53m which is a $50m loss on passengers alone weekly.

&#x200B;

50m$ does sound like a lot but with this being as bad as it gets and travel pretty much to be guranteed a steady increase arn't airlines fine? Let alone the 5b+ government aid to help.

Also UAL has 2.7B in cash and 52B in assets and with a 50m$ weeekly loss they could last for over a year before bankruptcy (or i may be retarded).  Also their biggest expense is salaries with 12b and fuel 9B and with 96,000 employees, of which 20,000 so far decalred they are willing to go on a leave of absence and united announcing that they will roll out a leave of absence program etc surely they should be good right?

**You** are the reason the market keeps rocketing up and we are headed for all time high's.

**New retail investors working from home, retired, or collecting unemployment. It's not fund rebalancing and it's not all about the FED printing machine.**

Here's why.

\+30 million unemployed + 90 million retired + 60 million working from home = **180 million at home bored as fuck**

A lot of these assholes have been watching everyone else make hand over fist on the 10 year bull run because who the fuck wants to buy at the top just to watch it tank... except it never tanked.

Well it tanked and here is finally their chance..... Combine this scenario with the follow perfect storm of unprecedented bored ass Americans and unlimited flows into the stock market.

**THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE TURBOCHARGING THE FUCK OUT OF THE MARKET AND RAPING YOUR SPY PUTS.**

1. Casino Gambling Degenerates: $100 Billion Per year
2. Sports Betting Degenerates: $150 Billion per Year
3. Student Loan Deferments: $70.4 Billion (4 months)
4. Stim Trump Checks: $157 Billion (one time payment)
5. $600 per week unemployment checks: $250 Billion (4 months)
6. Mortgage Forbearance: $25 Billion (4 months)
7. 401k Withdraws so far: $60 Billion
8. America's cash savings accounts: $250 Billion
9. Tax Refunds (perfect timing and nothing to spend it on): $22.5 Billion Dollars
10. Lockdown Spending Reduction (traveling, entertainment, etc): $100 Billion (4 months)

That is **1 TRILLION DOLLARS** of liquidity that's typically allocated differently. Obviously, this is not all injected into the market, but I would guess a significant portion of it is because of the 180 million people now at home with access to free trading platforms.

If you don't believe me, then dig thru the recent 10K's of TD ameritrade, E-trade, Schawb, IB, etc.

TD-Ameritrade: New client assets: $45 Billion. 608k new accounts, 425k accounts in march alone

E-Trade: $17.9 Billion new client assests, 363k new accounts, 230k accounts in march

Schwab: $73 Billion new client assets, 609k new accounts, 280k accounts in march

ROBINHOOD: A fuck ton of new client assets. Feb 19th: Accounts in different stock positions = 16 million, April 25th: Accounts in different stock positions = 30 million. Thats almost double in 2 months.

I'm too lazy to list the sources, but it's all fairly accurate, if you want proof then just assume I'm lying and get the fuck out of here.

**TLDR: A perfect storm of people at home bored as fuck, unprecedented available cash flows available, degenerate gamblers needing a fix, and free trading platforms have injected BILLIONS of dollars into the market and it will not stop until people are forced kicking and screaming back into work.

Opinion: **We should all come to the conclusion that Trump sees the stock market’s success as the true picture of our economy.** 

That being said, as far as I know the election isn’t until November (7 months from now). 

If the market tanked in a matter of weeks, why wouldn’t the FED be able to again just pick up all the pieces once more should it happen all over again. You can’t all be seriously thinking we’ll hit ATH in the next week or two and sustain that till November and beyond. 

Let’s be real, Trumps buddies got smacked, he gave them a helping hand and now they’re in a prime position to short the market and make their money all over again. Trump can be the hero once more. 

Yes the recovery won’t be V shaped, so it’ll be booming after a “healthy drop.” Every figure, every analyst, every projection is looking for some kind of pullback. 

Even bullish investors I follow are starting to get confused. Yes this isn’t 2008, but even back in January everyone and their mother was screaming that stocks were overvalued. 

Now with a global pandemic, unemployment at record highs, stimulus for everyone, GDP contraction at great depression levels, and we’re all of a sudden back?? It’s just not healthy, PERIOD. It’s not sustainable. Q2 numbers are expected to be shit. Everyone’s guidance is basically pulled. And look at the markets reaction last week when news broke out that Gileads drug could be a flop.. it spooked! 

Things are running on very thin rope here and I personally see the risk/reward for long positions at this moment pretty low. That’s not to say we won’t run up another 5, 10, 20% who knows.. we’re currently living a simulation.. but if the hammer should fall, it’ll likely fall hard.. maybe it’ll be similar to the 2010 flash crash. Who knows.

All the DD that has been posted on here about the economy on the verge of collapse is correct. But SPY isn't made up of unemployment, GDP, housing starts, wage growth, MBS, etc.

That said, there are some economic inevitabilities that are doomed to play out at this point, and it seems we'll see it first or near first play out in Nevada.

When looking over google trends, I noticed something interesting with the words for 'forbearance,' 'unemployment,' and 'eviction.' On a country wide basis, many of those terms peaked interest at the end of march and have return to typical search level interest levels. But in Nevada? Those interest levels are at their all time highs.

Interesting and perhaps a clue of a larger issue, but nothing more than a tidbit now, right? So let's dive a little further.

Where does much of Nevada's economy exist? Well, based on population, Las Vegas has 21% of Nevada's population. Why don't we assume that LV represents anywhere from 30-40% of the Nevada economy.

Las Vegas depends on tourism for their income. Well, tourism doesn't exist right now, and most likely it will not exist until End of June at the earliest. Why do I say this? Because airlines such as Delta, Southwest, and United have all remarkably said the same thing: we expect 90-95% of last year's demand for this quarter to be wiped out this quarter. This makes something like tourism untenable for this second quarter.

Now, we're seeing companies like WYNN, LVS, and MGM taking out debt and reducing costs. Okay. Good. They'll survive a year of stopping and restarting. But the problem now is: most of these companies will not be seeing real pre-covid levels of traffic until spring 2021 realistically. So they will not be hiring back as many furloughed workers as assumed. Naturally, we can assume many people in Nevada have filed for unemployment. And when you look at the numbers across western states, you'll notice that Nevada's numbers were relatively similar to other west coasts states up to March, where they've diverged higher from other state's rises in unemployment.

Rent and cost of living in Nevada is 127.5% the average standard in the US. LV actually costs less to live in at 118.2% believe it or not. So while this is all happening, Las Vegas has to pay more to just to take care of the bills. Not a good recipe

This is all interesting data, but perhaps the most concerning bit was the Las Vegas mayor's CNN interview. She offered her city up as an experiment for how a city could deal with the virus aggressively re-opening.

Many people cried out she was putting lives in danger. But I see something different: I see a mayor who is likely getting calls everyday from her constituents who are out of work, out of money, and now looking to get thrown out of their homes. No, she's not acting stupid. She's acting desperate. She understands that her city is in real trouble.

Las Vegas historically does well in times of economic prosperity and poorly in times of economic contraction. But what about a major contraction? 

Put another way: We have a negative feedback loop. The state is paying out massive unemployment benefits while its revenue has collapsed (happening not just in Nevada but I'm sure it's more extreme.) So as revenues fall for the state, the state has to pay more out to its citizens so they can survive. What does this mean? Good luck with hiring a full police force with the $2 you have left in your state coffers.

While markets have dislocated from the real economy, the real economy gets worse every day. We need to see real policy change or we're doomed to fall into a depression.

I don't have positions. But if you want some:

We know Wall Street and Investor aren’t all autists, so why did earnings just defy everything we ever knew about stocks. 

Companies are barely meeting or slightly exceeding their Q1 expectations which were all lowered to reflect the impact of Covid-19. But the shelter-in-place didn’t even start until late March, so essentially, these expectations should have never even been lowered in the first place. In the middle of March, people were out shopping, dining, doing whatever, spending money. Yeah China was down, but manufacturing only stopped for a few weeks, and all other economies were still going strong. 

Stocks like FB, Google, Tesla, all up 10% on earnings that came in line with lowered expectations for a quarter that was mainly no different than any other quarter. Then, they all speak to the unprecedented impact that Covid is having on their business (starting probably in April) and the stock just rallies more. 

Facebook says they saw a “steep” decline in ad revenue at the end of March, but it stabilized in April. So what does that mean, it stabilized as-in stopped declining, or stabilized as in came back to normal. I would go with it stopped declining, but they still could be sitting on 20-30% declines.

Tesla sold a shit load of vehicles in Q1, we knew that. In Q2, they aren’t going to sell shit, and their factory could be shut down until June 1st, 2/3rds of the quarter. China won’t make up for that. Stock flies up. 

And despite all this, what the market hates most is uncertainty. So now we know that Q2 earnings will be very bad and uncertainty about the economy and virus are anyone’s call, yet earnings are flying off the rails like companies defied all odds in Q1 and the economy is back to normal. 

Seems like market doesn’t care about uncertainty anymore or future earnings, just cares about right now. WTF...

1557,DD,"[DD] APRN (Blue Apron) down over 20% on the day, still a LONG WAY down to go.",71,gafyjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gafyjv/dd_aprn_blue_apron_down_over_20_on_the_day_still/,42,1588217615.0,"Before the pandemic, Blue Apron was trading at an appropriate share price of around $2.50. After Covid-19, it became something of a meme ""OMG everyone is going to be ordering food while they are at home! Blue Apron is cheap compared to other meal delivery stocks! BUY BUY BUY!!!""

The stock quickly went up to a mind boggling $27 per share before trading was halted, and settled somewhere between $11-$12 after it resumed in the following weeks (still way too high for this trash company).

What all of these new buyers did not know about Blue Apron, is there is a reason the stock was so cheap compared to it's competitors. It's a very poorly run company. APRN is unable to hold on to new customers despite spending insane amounts on marketing to acquire them:

**Customer count Q4 2018:** 557,000

**Customer count Q1 2019:** 550,000

**Customer Count Q2 2019:** 449,000

**Customer Count Q3 2019:** 386,000

**Customer Count Q4 2019:** 351,000

**Customer Count Q1 2020:** 376,000

While they are spending money to acquire customers, customers are leaving in droves. They tried to switch focus to just keeping their ""loyal"" customers and reduce marketing spend, but to no avail. The good news was that they were finally acquiring new customers due to the pandemic without having to spend a lot of $ to acquire them. Or so everyone thought...

Fast forward to the earnings call today which was a complete cluster fuck. The CEO announced that they saw a 29% uptick of demand for meal kits - awesome right? Well they were only able to fill 22% of the 29% increase in orders.

Yes that's right, when Blue Apron was given a golden opportunity to save their failing business they weren't even in a position to fill all of the orders they received. During the Q&A section of today's earning call one investor asked how much revenue was lost due to their inability to meet demand...they wouldn't give us the numbers (guess it was that bad).

There was also a funny moment on the call this morning when an investor asked how they planned to keep the current increased demand due to covid-19 going when this all dies down, especially now that most places in America outside of a few hotspots have more than peaked for new cases...the reply was a laughable explanation of how they think ""this is the new normal, and the demand will not go away"" or some bullshit like that. Their business plan amounts to hoping that the pandemic never goes away? O.k...

So what did all of this boil down to? Within the first minutes of the market opening, shares were down well over 30% with APRN being subject to a circuit breaker. The stock settled around a 24% loss for the day. I was watching the charts very closely all morning.

24% plummet in a single day. 

So did you miss the boat? I don't think so. This stock was trading under $3 before the coronavirus hype, and shot up only because of the pandemic. Most businesses are dealing with loss of business due to the pandemic, and this is one of the few companies that actually saw an increase in demand due to it. In a favorable environment, APRN failed spectacularly.

I wouldn't buy puts as far down as $3 (even though I think it will go even below that eventually) due to the time sensitive nature of options but I think there is still more money to be made here. Morgan Stanley's price target on the stock is $6 and it's still trading well above that.

Pt. 1: $BC Brunswick Corp, which owns Mercury Marine (leader in watercraft engines) and Brunswick Boat Group, which manufactures Sea-Ray, as well as the more fishing-oriented Lowe Boats and Boston Whaler.

Google Trends search activity for Brunswick Corp.-related small fishing watercraft search terms was up this April compared to previous years.  I accumulated the data in a [table](https://i.imgur.com/IgUCA7H.png).  It's harder to see in the trends chart, except for the relatively [steep upticks at the end](https://i.imgur.com/EgSclHn.png).

[Bass Pro Shops, not publically traded, confirms a ""fishing"" play at work](https://i.imgur.com/kLMAl3Z.png)

Pt. 2: $PII Polaris

Ok, the real interesting story is **Polaris $PII.**

Polaris are a leading maker of recreational/outdoor utility vehicles like side-by-sides, ATVs, and snowmobiles.  They also own Indian Motorcycles, including sweet rides like [this](https://www.thedrive.com/motorcycles/23913/2019-indian-ftr-1200-and-ftr-1200-s-indians-flat-track-inspired-roadster-makes-its-debut).

$PII just had an [earnings call yesterday](http://ir.polaris.com/investors/news/news-details/2020/Polaris-2020-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx), and [actually maintained and built on their pre-earnings rally](https://i.imgur.com/g6Iwcc6.png) despite reporting (obviously) some [negative results](https://i.imgur.com/yuFVglU.png), including declines in sales lead by [boats and off-road vehicles](https://i.imgur.com/Vhs5wSa.png), with off-road vehicle profits declining mostly because of declines in sales of [side-by-sides](https://i.imgur.com/89Ax0i5.png).

**Here's the DD: Google search activity for *all* ORVs is sharply up**, and is in fact at [**all time highs**](https://i.imgur.com/fIgsZKM.png).  This is reflected in [ORV searches including the word ""financing""](https://i.imgur.com/S4rrx3A.png), suggesting this is real interest.

By contrast, there [is minimal change in searches for motorcycle brands](https://i.imgur.com/DWfzScl.png).  ""Jet ski"" also remains on trend, although perhaps it will spike as per usual later in the year.  (**With respect to motorcycles, it's interesting to note that Polaris reported Indian Motorcycles as a relative bright spot in Q1, despite not really reflecting in search.**) What this no-change tells me is that the increases in search activity are specific to certain sectors: namely, fishing/outdoor-recreation-adjacent activities.  It's not just that every dude is at home googling dream purchases because he's bored.  

Why does this matter?  [As noted in a fund's report on Brunswick](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insights-white-brook-capital-2020-174805036.html), any dollars that would have been allocated to vacations involving flying, cruise ships, theme parks, etc. are probably being redirected.  Add to that list bars, movies, etc.  Basically where are you going to be gathering with your family or drink with your friends?  Outdoors, away from 'caution'-taped park benches, and far from the coofing crowd (whether or not you think there's something be afraid of).

Position: $PII Sept 75c.  ATH is $93 or so.

* Test data is untouched during training 10:1:1 train:val:test.
* Yes, I consider it ""deep"" learning from what I learned at my institution. I use LSTMs at one point in my pipeline, feel free to consider that deep or not.
* I'll be making daily posts so that people can follow along.
* Someone mentioned RL, yes I plan on trying that in the future :). This would require a really clever way to encode the current state parameters. Haven't thought about it too much yet.
* Someone mentioned how companies beat earnings 61% anyway, so my model must be useless right? Well if you look at the confusion matrix you can see I balanced classes before training (with some noise). This means that the data had roughly 50/50 beat/miss and had a 58% test accuracy.

**TLDR:**

**Not financial advice.**

* I created a deep learning algorithm trained on 2015-2019 data to predict whether a company will beat earning estimates.
* Algorithm has an accuracy of 58%.
* I need data and suggestions.
* I’ll be making daily posts for upcoming earnings.

Greetings everyone,

I’m Bunga, an engineering PhD student at well known university. Like many of you, I developed an interest in trading because of the coronavirus. I lost a lot of money by being greedy and uninformed about how to actually trade options. With all the free time I have with my research slowing down because of the virus, I’ve decided to use what I’m good at (being a nerd, data analytics, and machine learning) to help me make trades.

One thing that stuck out to me was how people make bets on earnings reports. As a practitioner of machine learning, we LOVE binary events since the problem can be reduced to a simple binary classification problem. With that being said, I sought out to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a company will beat earnings estimates.

I strongly suggest **TO NOT USE THIS AS FINANCIAL ADVICE.** Please, I could just be a random guy on the internet making things up, and I could have bugs in my code. Just follow along for some fun and don’t make any trades based off of this information 😊

**Things other people have tried:**

A few other projects have tried to do this to some extent \[1,2,3\], but some are not directly predicting the outcome of the earnings report or have a very small sample size of a few companies.

**The data**

This has been the most challenging part of the project. I’m using data for 4,000 common stocks.

Open, high, low, close, volume stock data is often free and easy to come by. I use stock data during the quarter (Jan 1 – Mar 31 stock data for Q1 for example) in a time series classifier. I also incorporate “background” data from several ETFs to give the algorithm a feel for how the market is doing overall (hopefully this accounts for bull/bear markets when making predictions).

I use sentiment analyses extracted from 10K/10Q documents from the previous quarter as described in \[4\]. This gets passed to a multilayer perceptron neural network.

Data that I’ve tried and doesn’t work to well:

Scraping 10K/10Q manually for US GAAP fields like Assets, Cash, StockholdersEquity, etc. Either I’m not very good at processing the data or most of the tables are incomplete, this doesn’t work well. However, I recently came across this amazing API \[5\] which will ameliorate most of these problems, and I plan on incorporating this data sometime this week.

**Results**

After training on about 34,000 data points, the model achieves a 58% accuracy on the test data. Class 1 is beat earnings, Class 2 is miss earnings.. Scroll to the bottom for the predictions for today’s AMC estimates.

&#x200B;

**Future Directions**

Things I’m going to try:

* Financial twitter sentiment data (need data for this)
* Data on options (ToS apparently has stuff that you can use)
* Using data closer to the earnings report itself rather than just the data within the quarterly date

**A note to the dozen people who were following me before**

Thank you so much for the early feedback and following. I had a bug in my code which was replicating datapoints, causing my accuracy to be way higher in reality. I’ve modified some things to make the network only output a single value, and I’ve done a lot of bug fixing.

**Predictions for 4/30/20 AMC**:

A value closer to 1 means that the company will be more likely to beat earnings estimates. Closer to 0 means the company will be more likely to miss earnings estimates. (People familiar with machine learning will note that neural networks don’t actually output a probability distribution so the values don’t actually represent a confidence).

This pre-print from Columbia University looks into the re-infection rate of other coronaviruses that the world has dealt with and compares the likelihood that someone who contracts a coronavirus will become immune to that specific virus and how long they are immune, 4 endemic (widespread and not going anywhere, e.g. HIV is endemic in Africa) coronaviruses were tested in NY from 2016-2018.

[http://www.columbia.edu/\~jls106/galanti\_shaman\_ms\_supp.pdf](http://www.columbia.edu/~jls106/galanti_shaman_ms_supp.pdf)

>During the study, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times for the same coronavirus. We found no significant difference between the probability of testing positive at least once and the probability of a recurrence for the beta-coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 at 34 weeks after enrollment/first infection. We also found no significant association between repeat infections and symptom severity **but strong association between symptom severity and belonging to the same family**”

Quick explanation: re-infections of coronaviruses are not unheard of within one year and your genetics might have a stronger impact on your symptoms than your immune system's memory from when you were last infected.

The layman's explanation of what they found in the study is that 3 of the 4 coronaviruses had repeated infections in patients in under a year, some patients re-contracted the virus within 4 weeks but the median was 37 weeks. So, in theory, they could be susceptible again in a month after having the virus.

**But OP, that's why we're pumping the big bucks into a vaccine, vaccines fix this right?** Think again ya little turd monkey, vaccines are just dead viruses your body plays with so it knows what the real virus looks like when it comes around. It's like when your daddy gave you a carebear as kid so you could recognize you were just a big bear when you grew up. People who get chickenpox, for example, you can either get the disease and then you're immune or you get the vaccine and you're immune, either way, you don't get it twice. But with some things like the seasonal flu there's enough mutation that every year you need a new immunization because the virus is so different. In the paper they say they think it could be that genetic mutation ""*antigenic drift*"" or because of the host's immune system losing memory of the virus more rapidly.

**But OP these are the other coronaviruses, how do we know SARS-CoV-2 will act like this?** We don't but this virus sucks in every possible way. This article suggests that they couldn't re-infect monkeys but they still have only been testing for a matter of months, so they're uncertain as to how long the immunity lasts:

Hey all you cool cats and kittens, daddy is here with another play that's not completely retarded. As we all know oil has been bent over the barrel and shown the 50 states multiple times, and everyone here and their wife's boyfriend is trying to play it. That being said we are due for a nice little reversal, and whether the tree huggers like it or not, oil will be here to stay even with the progression of EVs and such. It's used in many different materials in addition to being the main energy source for transportation, at least in the near term. USO/oil ETFs are a stupid way to play oil if you know anything about contango, etc. so the only relatively safe way to play it is using an ETF that tracks oil and energy companies, like XLE. If you check my magic crayons, this ETF has a nice gap to fill and is trending to the upside, just broke some major resistance at the 35-36 level, and is forming the bullish autistic W sign (also known as a cup and handle).

When fundamentals and technicals come together, we make a tendie baby with some sweet sauce. The play is essentially a split strike synthetic long if you have the cash to cover the short puts, if not then the calls will likely print too. The short put side is because we don't mind owning an ETF with good companies yielding 6% if this gets crushed, since we can just hold until it rebounds again and sell for a profit. It also helps us cover the cost to buy the calls, by continuously rolling short puts around the major support/resistance line that will likely hold. The call at 38.21 (adjusted) puts it right in the sweet spot of the gap that hopefully will get blown through to the next point of around 42 where it gapped down.

1580,DD,Remdisivir probably doesn't work from current study results,38,gac87f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gac87f/remdisivir_probably_doesnt_work_from_current/,49,1588205195.0,"So what's up, I'm not expert but I do have a university background that includes research processes, pharmacology, and statistics. 

So the purpose of this study http://investors.gilead.com/node/36871/pdf was to examine whether a 5 versus 10 day course of remdesivir was preferable. It wasn't whether it was effective, it wasn't whether it was safe, simply comparing the 5 and 10 day course of treatment.

So for any drug you expect what's called a dose-response curve, which includes things like ed50, ld50, etc., and the more of a substance a person is given, the more of a response up until it's an effective dose, and if you keep going it's lethal.

Anyhoo, the one major finding that can be taken from this paper as released isn't that remdesivir helped anyone, it isn't that remdesivir was safe or effective, it was that the longer a patient was on remdesivir the worse they did.

Quoth the paper,
> “These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical
improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,” said Aruna Subramanian, MD, Clinical Professor of Medicine, Chief,
Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases, Stanford University School of Medicine, and one of the lead investigators of the study. “While
additional data are still needed, these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, **if proven safe
and effective.”**

Basically in almost any circumstance you would not expect less treatment to yield a larger and better effect, other than if there was some sort of floor or ceiling effect. Instead the most probable explanation is that remdesivir doesn't work.

They're trying to pre-emptively spin that one niggling fact.

edit: otherwise this study was not controlled, blinded, or compared in any way, and wasn't actually really a research study as most people would understand it. There are blinded and controlled studies, but those results would be unknown because they're blinded.

edit 2:  To make it clear, similar outcome = substantially worse for the 10 day group.

edit: they lay out their figures poorly, but deaths were actually 8% in the 5 day, and 11% in the 10 day. Way higher. All the figures are laid out in a really confusing way

Clinical recovery 129 (65) 106 (54) 0.17
Discharge 120 (60) 103 (52) 0.44
Death 16 (8) 21 (11) 0.70
Safety
Any adverse event (AE) 141 (71) 145 (74) 0.86
Grade ≥3 study drug-related AE 8 (4) 10 (5) 0.65
Study drug-related serious adverse event (SAE) 3 (2) 4 (2) 0.73
AE leading to discontinuation 9 (5) 20 (10) 0.07

The last numbers seem to be p values, which if so means nothing was significant in this study, as p < .05 is the minimal standard for anything. So **5 day remdesivir** condition shows a better recovery rate and a better death rate than the **10 day** condition. The difference is non significant, therefore ""similar"".

This is a POOR study result that is masquerading as a home run.

That has market analysts suggesting the rally has run its course & looking for a reversal to the downside. Rather, I think it is the pause that refreshes. S&P likely headed for 3100 next and ultimately headed for 4000+ this summer.

I'm calling for an 80% bear market to follow this final leg of a 38 year secular bull market. A lot of damage has been done but there is a historic amount of liquidity being pumped into the system with much more to come.

The consensus has it 180 degrees wrong. They said the bear market rally had run its course and bad earnings season would send market sharply lower. Instead the S&P is heading for 3100 in short order. Semis, FAANG, Miners will continue to lead & laggards will see some catch-up.

We are beginning to see some of the hardest hit areas of the market begin to outperform as they experience catch-up rallies. Some of those groups starting catch-up rallies include oil, industrials, housing & financials.

I expect the dollar to fall to 85-86 but the move to S&P 4000+ does not depend on it at all. It's all about sentiment & liquidity right now.

After the secular top, we're heading for a deep deflationary bust. We won't see sustainable inflation for at least a couple of years. But then we will see the first inflation-led recovery since the 1970's.

After a short pullback, gold & silver & the miners are now poised for another nice run. Gold to $2000+, silver to $26, GDX to $45, GDXJ to $70 and SIL to $60. Bitcoin will ride along quite aggressively.

I think you are going to be very surprised when the S&P is soaring past 4000 this summer. Pullbacks will occur on its way there but no retest of the lows. 

Why?

Very simple. Trillions of dollars being pumped into the system. That plus high bearish sentiment provides the backdrop for a parabolic run to new highs. Buybacks are not necessary. Once the secular top is reached, we will enter an 80% bear market (bust) down to S&P 800. 

We won't see 4000 again for decades because interest rates will move up with inflation. P/E multiples will be compressed.

S&P 4000+ this summer.

Gas inventories dropped, vs. an expected build. Crude oil inventories did not grow as much as thought. GILD dropped another ""positive"" note regarding their drug. These three were enough to overcome the other negative data, today.

https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/

 Oil: As stated above, crude oil inventories did not grow by as much as expected. Everyone has thought, oh, Cushing, OK is out of inventory, we haven't cut enough domestic production, we're going to keep building stock, run out of room, and oil is going to go negative again. Well, no, physically, there has been enough inventory there and there will continue to be, but, all this is leased out already. There are still major issues regarding oil production vs. consumption and I expect the supply chain issues with oil will build into mid May. At the moment, they are breathing a sigh of relief, and moving to the next phase.
https://twitter.com/Ole_S_Hansen/status/1255505696273113089/photo/1 Edit: Corrected this point based on a comment and tweet - was not accurate at first.

Gas: An increase in driving can already be seen, as states have begun to reopen. What had been expected, is even with an increase in driving, refineries were still producing and would have added to stores. With this in mind, I would argue gas consumption is a major indicator of a second wave, and should be a red flag for us. Guidelines for reopening indicated 14 days of sustained decline in # new cases are needed to support reopening. No one has done this, but we're going ahead 'merica style. Big implications for a reduction in the rate of reduction in new cases (ie.: we might not ""peak"" again, but the slope away from the peak will not drop as fast as we thought) and the possibility that hot spots will flair in the mid-west and south.

GILD: The market is ready to die or moon based on GILD. We saw this last week, with a crash and recovery based off a leaked report (negative) and the same thing two weeks ago (positive). The study has been beaten to death on here, go find some write ups on it for more. Today, we have good news, we are moon. Effectively, nothing has changed regarding GILD, as we knew what was released already. 


Something has to give, but today seems to be a relief rally. Relief, that our economy won't grind to a halt tomorrow. Supply chains are OK, if damaged and slower.

I have no idea how extensively $NAT has been reported on here, but hear me out. Nordic American Tankers CEO Herbjørn Hansson said on CNBC that they charge $70,000 for a day storing oil. He also said they have operational costs of $8,000 so that boils down to an average of $60,000 profits per tanker. Given that they have 23 Tankers in their fleet as of right now, that's roughly $1,380,000 per day. If they would ONLY have this price for 50 days in the quarter, that would yield $69,000,000 profits. (This is assuming that made ZERO money the other 40 days). Given Shares outstanding of 142,571,000 that would yield an EPS of $0.49. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blqp2f0YBj8))

HIGH Earning Estimates expect an EPS for the quarter is .35 and consensus EPS forecast is .25. Given all that, they report earnings on May 18 and should comfortably outperform the consensus. Given that tankers can charge up to $200,000 a day, and assuming they have this price for at least 50 days and making ZERO money the remaining days of the quarter, the projections are still conservative.

1594,DD,Why GILD release is bunk again,181,gaa59c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gaa59c/why_gild_release_is_bunk_again/,48,1588198192.0,"This GILD release is absurd. It’s an uncontrolled study of 5 vs 10 day treatment. 8% died in the 5 day and 11% in the 10 day. More were also discharged in the 5 day (60 vs 52%) and ""clinically recovered"" (65 vs 54%).

We dont have a control group so we have no idea if those numbers are good. They included “severe” patients who were NOT on a ventilator. No other high quality research specifically published those numbers to my knowledge, but the new york data showed 8% mortality among non ventilated hospitalized patients and 15% among ventilated (10% overall) (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2010419)

Not a whole lot of difference, is it? Best case, 8-11% mortality versus 15% but we know that 15% group is sicker, on ventilation already. Worst case, no effect at all with 8% mortality among non ventilated patients.

What is ""Severe""? It's not clear. According to their clinicaltrials.gov filing, the only thing related to disease severity I can find in the inclusion criteria is O2 sat <94%. They exclude people with liver or kidney dysfunction, or who are on ventilation. If that's really the whole of it, ""Severe"" is a pretty weak designation. MOST hospitalized patients for COVID meet this criteria! The new york data doesn't publish this number, but the series of the first 12 covid patients in america had 12/12 reaching <94% at some point (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=2ahUKEwi4pICA5o3pAhU8CTQIHfC1CCIQFjAEegQIBRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medrxiv.org%2Fcontent%2F10.1101%2F2020.03.09.20032896v1.full.pdf&usg=AOvVaw34JqTf84qOxyNsuTjMj7aa) So what does this mean? Their population is probably the same or very similar to the ""non-ventilated"" group at New York. Patients are generally not hospitalized with normal O2 sats - mild disease is sent home. Now, new york does report first 3 hour data for oxygen use (not saturation)- 48% within the FIRST 3 HOURS of admission were on oxygen (generally you won't be on oxygen with a sat >94%). Gilead is light on the details with regards to when they are recruiting people - if it's within hours of admission, sure, maybe only half of hospitalized patients meet their criteria. If not, then it's well known that O2 sats drift downward as the disease progresses, so if they're recruiting people along the way that will be MOST if not all hospitalized patients. 

Further more, did you notice the trend between groups? The 5 day did marginally better without reaching significance (10 had 0.75 the odds of a good outcome versus 5). They did this study to find out if a shorter course worked. It's always nice to see a ""dose response curve"" in trials like this. Basically, more drug is usually better... just not enough to merit increased cost or side effects. In this case, we have a trend toward less drug being better. That speaks to either statistical variance from a drug that doesn't work, or a harmful drug. Now, 5% stopped due to side effects in the 5 day group vs 10% in the 10 day group, but there's no logical reason to believe the increased stop rate occurred early on - each dose is the same,  it's just the length that's modulated. So I would argue the difference in good outcomes is evidence against efficacy, not adverse effects.

I’m not buying these results until they publish the placebo controlled data. Fyi that china data was placebo controlled and showed jack.",2020-04-29 18:09:52,0.8732,0.0,0.10881343283582087,0.32733781094527364

[Here's what I said about GILD a bit of a while ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8y4jt/daily_discussion_thread_for_april_27_2020/forcpua/)

The upcoming trial was non-placebo controlled - this thing was very unlikely to look bad, and the market has shown it will eat up any positive garbage (see past GILD leak, INO, MESO, etc.)

Once we look into the trial data, we'll realize it doesn't show that much. And once some actual placebo control trials come out in May, we'll see that remdesivir actually has a pretty limited role in treatment of coronavirus and is not the panacea that can move trillions in the market. 

Remdesivir's role in treatment is likely only early on in high risk patients. There is almost certainly an overreaction right now.

EDIT:

That said, I don't think placebo controlled trials for REM are coming till May. So might take a bit. I might go cash gang or just keep buying weekly calls...we'll see how fast the market reacts. GI

It's already dumping a bit pre market. Hope I can still sell my calls....

>Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced topline results from the open-label, Phase 3 SIMPLE trial evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the investigational antiviral remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease. The study demonstrated that patients receiving a 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvement in clinical status compared with those taking a 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 – 1.12] on Day 14). No new safety signals were identified with remdesivir across either treatment group. Gilead plans to submit the full data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in the coming weeks.

All the study says is that a 10 day and 5 day regimen are similar....ok.

>In this study, the time to clinical improvement for 50 percent of patients was 10 days in the 5-day treatment group and 11 days in the 10-day treatment group. More than half of patients in both treatment groups were discharged from the hospital by Day 14 (5-day: 60.0%, n=120/200 vs.10-day: 52.3% n=103/197; p=0.14). At Day 14, 64.5 percent (n=129/200) of patients in the 5-day treatment group and 53.8 percent (n=106/197) of patients in the 10-day treatment group achieved clinical recovery.

For non-severe patients?....really not particularly amazing.

It does say that mortality outside of Italy was <10% - potentially justifiable statement, but we know from the Chinese trial that was halted (lack of patients, but n>200) that it showed no difference vs. placebo. Basically we don't know that much more than we knew a few weeks back.

Hunger is coming. Of course we’re going to rise to change the whole of the political class.”

The Lebanese pound, long pegged at around 1,500 to the dollar, has lost three times its value since October, reaching 4,500 to the dollar on black markets this week — a steep drop from 3,000 just two weeks ago.

The country now has at least five valuations for its currency: the peg for foreign exchange dealers is different from that for incoming transfers, which is different from rates offered by banks. At least one Lebanese bank added “USD Market Price” to its ATM currency options, allowing depositors to withdraw Lebanese pounds from their dollar account at 2,000 to the dollar.

Anger toward banks gained fresh momentum as the pound collapsed. Last week, Prime Minister Hassan Diab sharply criticized the performance of central bank governor Riad Salameh, who has held his post since 1993. His policies have included having banks transfer customers’ dollar deposits to the central bank to shore up the country’s foreign currency reserves.

The shortage of dollars — which are used in everyday transactions in Lebanon — and the crash in the value of the pound has undercut the country’s ability to pay for imports, including essentials such as wheat and oil. Banks have stopped giving short-term loans to businesses and no longer provide them dollars for imports, so many now depend on expensive black market dollars.

Not financial advice. Remember: I am an idiot. **TL,DR: the bull case around earnings remains strong in the short-term (30 days) which is all I care about.**

Reading a lot of oil tanker trader feeds (OOTT). Info from the ones with actual jobs in the industry...

BULL case:

* the absolute crazy spot rates for tankers ($200K+) are currently gone, **but**
* tanker storage rates are often still at multiples of normal rates on spot market, and at least strongly ""elevated""
* long-term contract rates are at very high, well-above ""normal"" prices
* the ""lower"" storage adds are because there's truly little room in Cushing (the ""empty"" space is for refining needs, and the rest is contracted)
* The storage issue is now global
* top names are trading around Feb stock prices, as if market expected somewhat typical (but good) year, after sell-off

BEAR case

* the contango curve is dropping hard/gone for the moment with the rise in WTI
* US govt says they'll store hundreds of millions of barrels for US producers in strategic reserve
* Noobs out of USO after reverse split + USO changing to ""we can buy *any* type of oil contract"" pulled a shit ton of pressure on WTI rates
* OPEC+ cuts start now, will have a strong effect
* US cuts (and others) are already in effect
* POTUS punched Saudi Arabia in the face, and threatened regime change and complete Middle Eastern destabilization without cuts, which came immediately

BULL response (whoops):

* It's middle month, there's a likely huge drop in WTI prices coming again as we near May 21 settlement
* Production cuts today drive future price cuts, pressure rates for immediate contracts, little effect on oil already in holds
* Russia cheats on cuts all the time. Other countries may join them
* The storage space for hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the strategic reserve is a fantasy (unless the Jones Act is suspended, meaning taker calls print, or oil in the ground is counted as ""reserve"" and the US govt pays for future production...which feels insane, but no less insane than any other economic decision by the USA these days)

Twitters I'm reading: just #OOTT and you get a lot of info. The wheat from the chaff I'm using are

* [https://twitter.com/TankerTrackers](https://twitter.com/TankerTrackers) (I grabbed premium sub, but haven't asked for info on particular tanker company fleets from today's report on oil storage yet)

I took the advice of smarter people, and sold my NAT calls all for profit (50% - 200+%). I am holding several others still, and further dips would make me load more. I definitely will buy STNG calls at this price because it's back to near ""yawn""-type year levels. Since it's the first, if it reports blockbuster numbers everybody reacts to them.

Everything's fine.

Maybe you got furloughed, that's ok. You're probably making more on unemployment now. Everything's fine.

Now you have time to learn how to bake, maybe finally sleep in and play some video games. Maybe start looking for a better job. You were thinking about quitting anyway. It’s basically summer break with a pay raise. Everything’s fine. We should do this pandemic thing every few years.

Maybe you’re a small business owner, you’re fine too. State is locked down, so no customers, but that’s ok. The government is paying your entire payroll and rent. States are already opening up, soon you’ll be back to normal. Everything’s fine.

Big business? Government’s got some loans for you too, low interest even. Fed is buying your junk bonds, so cash flow is no problem. And if you start to struggle, you’ll even get some free government money too. Costs are down since you just furloughed half your workforce onto unemployment, hey they’re probably making more unemployed anyway. Everything’s fine.

Or maybe you’re working from home. This pandemic isn’t so bad; you get to wear pajamas all day. No commute so you can sleep in, and when you do drive you’ve never seen the traffic this light. Everything’s fine. The stores are all closed, so maybe you’ll buy some dumb shit on Amazon with your $1,200 stimulus. Everything’s fine.

Fast Forward to Mid-June

PPP (Small Business Grants) lasts 8 weeks. We’re 2-3 weeks in, so lets say PPP starts running out around mid-June. All those furloughed workers you brought back kicking and screaming (they were making more on unemployment) so you could pay your rent with the remaining 25% are getting laid off again, this time permanently. But that’s ok, we’ve got the extra $600 unemployment on steroids, time for another pay raise.

By this time there’ll be around a month-ish left on the PUA (Unemployment on Steroids) and being laid off from your shitty bartending job won’t feel like a 4 month paid vacation with a little extra spending money, the clock is ticking. Maybe time to actually look for a new job this time…

Well everyone else is thinking the same thing. Small business jobs are evaporating, people actually starting to fear the $600/week going away, states are starting to enforce the job seeking requirements, so even the people who never got called back are sending out a flood of applications to keep their poverty $300/week going. 

The government’s spent, what, $4-7 Trillion by this point. Interest rates already at zero, but the only people borrowing are big businesses who are hemorrhaging money at this point. Remember, we were at the peak of a decade long bubble? Fuelled by corporate debt? Now those chickens are coming home to roost too. The Fed can’t buy your junk bonds forever. 

The government blew their load too early and it’ll start looking like a real bone fide recession. State and municipal budgets are mega-fucked since they rely on sales tax revenue and unemployment checks come right out of their treasury. 50/50 on whether Trump decides to bail them out, if not then add a bunch of teachers, paramedics, construction workers, and paper pushers to the unemployed job seekers line.

Built my net worth and career by finding substantially mispriced asymmetric investments/trades. 

The uranium mining trade is the most asymmetric investment I've come across in my career. The best way to play it is through $CCJ 1/22 $15 Calls. 10-15x+ upside.

Uranium (U308) is the top performing commodity of 2020. +33% YTD. ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-commodity-performer-uranium-gains-174753885.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-commodity-performer-uranium-gains-174753885.html)) 

The party is just getting started. 

**The industry has been in the shit house since the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Prices went from $70+/lb in 2011 to \~$33/lb today. They were around $120-130/lb in 2007.** 

Uranium is used for nuclear power generation. 20% of US power and 10% of global power comes from nuclear. Demand for nuclear power is growing \~2%/yr, mostly driven by China. China thinks with 10+ year time horizon. Demand for nuclear power not impacted by COVID-19 ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-nuclear/china-says-virus-outbreak-will-not-impact-nuclear-power-plant-construction-idUSKCN21X0B4](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-nuclear/china-says-virus-outbreak-will-not-impact-nuclear-power-plant-construction-idUSKCN21X0B4)).

This is a supply story. Mining at today’s prices is uneconomical. **From 2017-2018, mine closures due to unprofitable production led to 25% of global uranium supply being shut down, including the world's largest uranium mine (McArthur River).** Imagine what would happen to the price of oil if 25% of global oil supply was taken offline.

So why didn't the supply cuts lead to a higher uranium prices? 

The market was still oversupplied after Fukushima. Japan was 12% of global uranium demand and shut down all their reactors post-2011. There was still an excess of supply in the spot market. 

For nuclear power plants, running out of fuel is not an option. And Utilities can’t just put uranium from a mine into their reactors – there are a lot of steps in between. The nuclear fuel cycle takes 18 -24 months. Nuclear power utilities typically enter into long-term 8-10 year contracts to ensure security of supply. 

Many nuclear power utilities locked into long-term contracts for uranium at the peak of the prior bull market in 2011. Those contracts are now entering a roll-off phase. **40% of utility demand is uncovered in 2020 and over 80% is uncovered by 2025** **(source: UxC).**

So why is the uranium price +33% YTD? 

Due to COVID-19, Kazatomprom, the largest uranium producer, announced in April it was reducing activities at its uranium mines for three months. Meanwhile, Cameco ($CCJ), the #2 largest uranium miner in the world, halted production at their Cigar Lake mine in Canada, the world’s largest producing mine, then extended the suspension for an “indeterminate” period on April 13. **All told, the shutdowns wiped out about 35% of annual mined global uranium output.** 

The excess post-Fukishima material has finally worked its way out of the market and utilities are waking up to how tight the market really is (hence +30% rally in March). **The cash costs to produce uranium are about $25-$30 per pound and the all-in sustaining cost when you add exploratory capex, royalties etc., is near $50-$60 per pound.** 

The next uranium contracting cycle is upon us, and prices will need to rise materially to incentivize new production. The best way to play this is through $CCJ 1/22 $15 Calls. CCJ is easily a $30+ stock at $50-$60/lb uranium (I have a model, not just sticking my dick in the air). Calls have 10-15x+ upside.

Why the long dated calls? 

Option math works a lot better over short intervals. Once you extend the time horizon, all sorts of exogenous variables can throw a wrench into option-pricing models. 

Remember, a key assumption of black-scholes is that daily stock price changes are independent of the prior days—i.e. trends are not predictable and daily changes in stock prices reflect no memory of prior days; there is no price reflexivity. 

The longer the time period, the greater the potential for a trend, and hence the greater the chance that a longer-term price move will exceed the standard deviation implied probability, which increases only by the square root of time.

Fellow money loser here. Recently I've been seeing tons of retards asking to buy tanker stocks because ""fLoaTiNg StOraGE"" and ""WHERE THEY GUNNA STORE THE OIL MOFO?""

Here's my thesis.

1. The main cause/reason for the spike in worldscale/freight rates today in the market is mainly due to the short term demand destruction in oil/products. Supply, however, is unable to adjust short term, causing a spike in derived demand for oil as oil producers rush to get rid of their oil as much as possible.
2. Given time, however, supply of oil will drop. Derived demand for tankers will drop as well.
3. The market for freight is mainly a very tight market. I.e: if there are 100 cargoes and 99 vessel positions open, freight will spike. The opposite is true; Since no owner wants to be caught dead with an idling vessel (every Owner's shop in the world out there aims for 100% time+space utilization), they will undercut each other to not be the floating vessel.
4. Given 3, what will happen when finally all of the floating vessels discharge their oil? All the open vessel positions in the world...and no cargo to perform.

Given the above 4 points, I believe VLCC rates are in for a fall. By that extension, tanker stocks will fall. Unfortunately, I'm unable to understand if the same will happen for product tankers since the futures contracts for oil products (diesel, jet, MOGAS, etc) are not open to retail investors.

Data supporting: VLCCs subs have been failing, WS rates falling, WTI/Brent contango narrowing which causes the TC breakeven for floating storage to narrow.

That's my two cents. Are any charterers/traders willing to give me an opposite POV?

Also, to all the faggots reading this post. If you don't know what is Worldscale, Time Charter Earnings, vessel positions, contango, space/time utilization, idling vessel...you shouldn't be fucking touching shipping.",2020-04-30 22:47:49,0.999,0.0,-0.17136854838709673,0.27587715053763445

I'm a doordash driver (this is what diamond hands gets you. I went from $157 to $7500 to $850). I've got some DD on a few restaurants, some of this info might be super useful, some might not.

* Chipotle – this is the main DD, the big papi. As you know from their earnings, they've been absolutely crushing sales. Every time I go theres at least 5 bags awaiting pickup, and sometimes there's up to 20. Today they've even instituted an alphabetical distribution because they just have so fucking many bags. The cooking staff was not taught how to wear masks, though, and they just wear them around their necks. There are people straight up talking to each other while looking down directly over freshly cooked steak. If they've got the virus it is becoming acquainted with every burrito bowl and quesadilla they prepare. I'm not sure if they can be held accountable for this, but I suspect Chipotle is directly responsible for a significant amount of virus spreading (albeit, this is anecdotal evidence). If a few workers get sick, though, they will quickly spread it to each other and we can expect some sort of headline or strike or something. Keep in mind Chipotle's past issues with food safety.
* MacDonald – sir, this is a MacDonald. MCD's is crushing it as well, but not as strongly as some of the other fast food joints like chick fil a and popeyes. With that said, MCD is the cleanliest of any restaurant I've been to since the pandemic started. Everyone's got masks and gloves on properly, and inside it is cleaner than ever. Also, MCD has a presence on many different delivery platforms and is open all night so I think they're at least doing a good job staying above water.
* Cheesecake factory – only been getting orders on weekend nights for the most part. They're doing pretty poorly right now and the quantity of orders seems to be far from where it needs to be. This may be a shit estimate, but based on my anecdotal experience they could have lost 80%+ of business. Cheesecake Factory's main value driver (besides the cheesecake obviously) is the experience and atmosphere of going to the restaurant. Otherwise, it's basically just microwave meals that people can just buy at the grocery store frozen. They've got the social distancing going well though and are more high tech than all the other restaurants. Drivers are alerted when to come into the restaurant to pick up the food. Surprisingly, nobody else does this. 
* Taco Bell – drive thru has a steady flow and to be honest how many people actually go and sit inside a taco bell in the first place. People are still getting baked and driving thru or ordering probably at or near the same quantity before the pandemic. Although, I'll add that the drive thru clerk has not had a mask or gloves and is probably handling a decent amount of cash money. 
* Wendy's – I decline orders for Wendy's since making the mistake of accepting the first one I got. The line is usually around the block for the drive thru, and that was the only option for drivers. Safe to say that they're totally crushing business, but that they haven't learned a single fucking thing in operations management. Learn how to fucking handle the crowd of people that literally want to hand you their money. Chick fil a does this right but is unfortunately not publicly traded. Chick fil a had 250 cars easily when I went and I declined the order as well. But at least they have a parking lot management team with people running orders out to cars, and a separate spot for doordash/delivery drivers so they don't have to wait in the same line. 
* Dunkin – I expect Dunkin is not doing nearly as well as they usually do. Doordash orders are kinda atypical in the first place because who needs coffee brought to them? Some people I guess. But my theory with this one is that all the college students and young professionals who rely on Dunkin every morning for their job/school work have cut down significantly. Hours are down at a lot of locations and social distancing makes it so that only 4-6 people can wait in line in a typical dunkin. They are suffering. Also, most of their stores don't have a drive thru.

So I obviously only included public companies, but hopefully this info can provide some utility to you gambling idiots. I myself have lost like 95% of the value on almost every one of my puts and I'm using my doordash earnings to yolo on LSD penny stocks so take my words with a grain of salt. Also, word is that Doordash and other gig economy companies have stopped onboarding because there are too many people on the job.

The Invisible Enemy is only a side-piece in this battle. Most of you have felt it, but do not see the battle lines drawn out. The SPY bears are making their last stand. At the other end are the charging bulls, buoyed by a fresh wave of green by the Feds' mighty printer.

&#x200B;

The first line of defense, the moat at SPY 293, has been assaulted heavily. SPY 293 is the 61.8 Fibonacci retrace. I read an [Investopedia article on Fibonacci ratios](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/fibonacciretracement.asp), so I am an expert on this just like the rest of you. This 61.8 Fibonacci number is simply a magic number which works in the same way magic does: it's plucked from the air and doesn't always work.

&#x200B;

The second line of defense is the castle walls at SPY 297. This is where the heaviest combat will be. If the bulls are able to storm through this and successfully take the castle of SPY 300, they will have an open path to SPY 310. From there, the bulls will be able to spy the peaks of SPY's ATH. That is not to say that SPY will reach ATH anytime soon.

&#x200B;

The fundamentals would hardly matter. Never mind the unemployment numbers, the rising death count and cases or even that this could be the deepest recession since the Great Depression.

&#x200B;

The bulls will continue their headlong charge until they wear themselves out or when the bears finally give up. Till then, we will continue to see SPY trading in this channel between 280 and 297, perhaps even until next week.

Oil will recover when the economy opens up no matter what. The price of oil plunged due to the lack of demand. Once the economy opens back up, even if you don't have the money to spend on a new car, you would still pay for gas to get groceries.

Oil is essential in the year of 2020, regardless how soon TSLA is going to replace gasoline cars.

Natural gas mooned because it is used to generate electricity. Oil is next when people have to go back to their jobs. With all fundamentals pointing back to oil, like even airlines run on oil, shipping vessels run on oil, there's no need to chase after travel industry when you can capitalize on the foundation of all industries. 

There are calls on MRO, XOM... But I want to bring your attention to a really undervalued one. What's the fun of an increase from 6 dollar back to 13 in MRO, 8 dollar back to 12 on ET when you can have 4 dollar back to 13 in the near future.

Regardless of any looming mortagage defaults, car loan defaults, you can rest assure oil is going back to  Feb level while REIT might lead the plunge later.

**Main Findings (4/29):**

1. A total sum of **$562m** was spent on SPY Options on 29 Apr, of this umber, **$94m expired on 4/29**. What the fuck.
2. Total sum **spent on puts** was **$281m** and, **spent on calls** was **$280m.** This was a stark difference from yesterday where significantly more puts were bought.
3. The largest bet is $37m spent on **SPY 285c that expired on that day**, with a midpoint price of $8.36 per option. This guy probably exercised the options and now hold 4.4 million SPY stocks, meaning he might have the biggest pee pee right now.
4. Some big brain bought $33m worth of **$297 Straddles expiring 7/17**, what is he playing at? who knows?

**Conclusion (4/29):**

After Chair Pow said ""we won't out of money"" market shifted stance from bearish to mixed.

**Main Findings (4/30):**

1. A total sum of **$441m** was spent on SPY Options on 30 Apr, of this umber, **$181m will be expiring 5/1**. Thats almost half of the options, madmen.
2. A huge amount of straddles from 5/1 to 5/8 maybe these guys are betting on crazy volatility, maybe theta gang is selling them these options.
3. The largest bet is $50m spent on **SPY 290 Straddles expiring 5/1**, 14k puts and 10k calls with a midpoint price of \~$2 per option. This guy is expecting SPY to move greater than $4 either way on 5/1 and looks like they are right.

**Conclusion (4/30):**

Rich people are vega gang today.

**Main Findings (5/1):**

1. A total sum of **$440m** was spent on SPY Options on 1 May, of which **$113m expired 15 minutes after purchase**. What is wrong with these people??
2. Excluding options that have already expired, **$209m were puts** and **$116m were calls**. This means were are bearish again.
3. The largest bet is $37m of **285 straddles expiring 5/29** at 32% IV, these straddles were approximately $20 each. In order for these straddles to print **SPY has to move up to 305 or down to 265**. Or he has to sell them to another sucker before it expires.
4. A whole bunch of **puts ($88m) expiring on that day** were bought 15 minutes before market close. After taking their strike price, subtracting closing price and midpoint (price of contract), **all of these puts lost money** and likely expired worthless.

**Conclusion (5/1):**

I dunno man, these plays seem pretty retarded to me. I would say, the people are betting that volatility may be going up again, consider loading up on VXX (BONUS: $4m was spent on VXX ATM Calls expiring next week).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

**(4/29)** \- SPY $297 Straddles 7/17

**(4/30)** \- SPY $290 Straddles 5/1 or just buy VXX.

**(5/1)** \- R.I.P to $50m spent on $290 straddles yesterday. SPY $285 Straddles for 5/29 OR JUST BUY VXX.",2020-04-30 13:57:17,-0.9996,0.0,-0.17543333333333336,-0.3916777777777778

It's obvious Trump will go to any lengths to keep the market propped up until his election at the least but why does the market show weakness in similar times of each election year? Does the market signal something? Does the market cash out gains out of speculation of if the current president gets replaced?  
  
In '08 it was different but we did have some QE going and some stimulus.. and it did go down, just after the beginning of May.  
  
To me... It looks like the market wants to cash out because it knows it'll get some more pumps since the current POTUS wouldn't let the market tumble right before the election. ""But it did just crash"" yea, it did in '08 too, everyone's greedy as fuck. How much more stimulus can the market get? If we see another tumble, it may be a long ride down.

Honestly, all the DD posted in the last few days has been absolute shit so I’m sorry that this summary has been bad. Mondays post will be better I hope. When all the DD that is posted is 5 sentences that say a bunch of bullshit that even the dumbest of fucking retards can understand then nothing good can happen here.

**MTCH;** I have talked about Match before and pretty much said the same thing I'm gonna say here. [This post says all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/) you need to know. They own shit ton of the online dating industry and practically have a monopoly on that market. They own Tinder, Match, PlentyOFish, etc. and because of the lockdown the number of users on each of these applications are up by a lot. Overall, it’s a safe bet to think that their profits are going to go up. They release earnings on 5/5 so it's looking to be good. Watch for a run-up before in anticipation of high earnings. If there is a run-up then sell before earnings and lock in your gains if you're smart. Calls for 80 look good to me. 

&#x200B;

**GOOGL;** [This post breaks down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9zct3/alphabet_earnings_call_writeup/) everything that Alphabet said during their earnings call. I am not going to summarize a summary so just read it for yourself if you're interested.

&#x200B;

**A Reminder;** Now this is something I've never done and this is to remind you of plays that I have recommended in the past. First is Activision. My post from [4/21-4/22](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g68ny9/dd_from_421422_activision_tyson_square_and_gains/) recommended Activision, Tyson (which panned out) and Square. They are making money hand over fist from their new games and will continue as long as we are in quarantine. I am personally in Activision for 5/8 for 78c and 79c. Read my ATVI writeup because I am still confident in this play. I would also like to recommend Echostar again with their earnings coming on the 13th. People are still upgrading their internet plans through HughesNet (which is owned by Echostar), and SATS is pushing new satellites that will increase internet speeds. Their earnings should be great. I wrote a post on it on [4/14-4/15](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1x0y4/dd_from_414415_echostar_hasbro_yelp_and_shit_tldr/) so read that for more info. I stand by both of these which is why I am reminding you. Money is still to be made here.

 

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** You guys suck at DD, Match will go up, Alphabet did pretty good, Activision is still a good play, Echostar is still a good play.

**Plays;** MTCH 80c for 5/8, ATVI above 68c for 5/8, SATS 35c for 5/15.

1)   WTI traded negative last month because a small number of small traders could not take delivery because there was no storage at Cushing.

2)  Now there is less storage at Cushing.

3)  There is going to be even less storage at Cushing nearing expiry day.

4)  Open interest is for WTI June 2020 is relatively low but rising - meaning that traders who need to sell or take delivery are increasing

5)  Production cuts will only take effect late May/ Early June

Is this a disaster waiting to happen?

Possible scenarios?

1)  Last month's ""small trader"" squeeze was a preview of this month's epic producers squeeze and we go to -$100, -$1000? because producers have no buyers who can take delivery.

2)  Traders who have booked storage at Cushing are waiting till the last minute to buy at spot prices and oil will not trade at negative

3)  Enough oil moves out of Cushing freeing up space for traders to take delivery

4)  Does Magic oil fairy balance the supply and demand in time for June expiry?

What am I missing?

Tweets from investor Rob Schmied at bottom of article:

1/ Regarding the tweetstorm today from [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk), I posit the following theory and analysis, that results in the idea that he will begin actively selling [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=ctag) shares as early as Monday, deleverage personally, raise billions in after-tax funds, all prior to being dismissed as CEO

2/ Share sales raising billions could only take a few days prior to the required SEC filings disclosing such sales. His tweets today arguably gave everyone fair warning of these pending sales (""selling almost all physical possessions"").   Shares are physical possessions. 

3/  These funds will be plenty to defend himself and the officers and directors from lawsuits when [$TSLA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=ctag) fails. Furthermore, this tweetstorm will help in the legal battle.   
Calling out your shares as overvalued negates significant claims from anyone buying or holding the shares. 

4/  It is now common knowledge that EM is selling his possessions and thinks the shares are overvalued. How can anyone sue? Furthermore, his tweets might result in his dismissal as CEO in the very near term (30 days?). Provides enough time to clean up any internal smoking guns. 

 5/ Most bears know that bringing in the fresh eyes of an outside CEO will hasten the rapid demise of Tesla.   The accounting, regulatory, and other fraud has been massive.   When this goes it will go fast.   However, the global pandemic and factory closure provide perfect cover. 

 6/  So in summary,  EM gets billions out while telling everyone he is doing it, the company will ultimately go BK and can blame COVID-19 the fascist behavior of the government, and his persona will likely keep him out of prison and comfortably in his G650. 

 7/ It is the perfect setup and window. He must do it right now or risk lose everything. Can't wait until later in Q2, his window will close. This is much safer than trying to do another offering. With this as the plot, his tweets make perfect sense, and are diabolically brilliant 

 8/ Lastly, I believe he is still restricted from selling pursuant to the last equity offering, until May 13th. This can be waived by GS however.  Perhaps GS asked him to ""disclose"" via twitter that he was selling and that the shares were pricey?  all jmho and pure speculation.

1)   WTI traded negative last month because a small number of small traders could not take delivery because there was no storage at Cushing.

2)  Now there is less storage at Cushing.

3)  There is going to be even less storage at Cushing nearing expiry day.

4)  Open interest is for WTI June 2020 is relatively low but rising - meaning that traders who need to sell or take delivery are increasing

5)  Production cuts will only take effect late May/ Early June

Is this a disaster waiting to happen?

Possible scenarios?

1)  Last month's ""small trader"" squeeze was a preview of this month's epic producers squeeze and we go to -$100, -$1000? because producers have no buyers who can take delivery.

2)  Traders who have booked storage at Cushing are waiting till the last minute to buy at spot prices and oil will not trade at negative

3)  Enough oil moves out of Cushing freeing up space for traders to take delivery

4)  Does Magic oil fairy balance the supply and demand in time for June expiry?

1751,DD,Texas Railroad Comission - False hopes,14,gbsszi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbsszi/texas_railroad_comission_false_hopes/,24,1588404093.0,"TLDR; buy calls on long oil ETFs early next week, sell after the Texas Railroad Comission decision on May 5th and convert into puts 

It's been a while since the negative oil prices on the 21sr and oil has been out of the limelight of Wall Street bets for quite some time. However, I believe there is a remarkable opportunity to make immense profits on some upcoming oil related news.

The Texas railroad commission has in the works a proposed 20% cut of Texas oil production up to one million barrels per day. Now, experts are sceptical of the actual efficacy this cut would have; however what really matters is the perception that it will improvethings for oil.  When this act is approved and I have little doubt it will be, oil prices will surge. However, if you carefully read the proposal you will realize that the oil production cuts will not take effect until June if the act is approved in May. Therefor, it will be too late to stop the overflowing of US oil storage capabilities in mid May and more negative oil prices.

In order to capitalize on this to the utmost, we should buy calls on long oil ETF's early next week. That once the production cut news hits on 5th and oil surges, sell your calls and immediately convert them into puts with an expiration of at least may 22nd, the next WTI futures contract settlement date or if possible June 21st (the subsequent contract)

1752,DD,Fallout $610p: Elon's Tweet,55,gbsrhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbsrhz/fallout_610p_elons_tweet/,70,1588403958.0,"**EDIT 2**: after further research, the below post is fundamentally flawed. Stonks only go up, and it was dumb to think otherwise. Position exited and lesson learned.

**Synopsis**. This post explains why Elon's tweet today may result in SEC action and will result in stockholder lawsuits. I invite you, dear reader, to decide whether these impending lawsuits and the Tesla board's fiduciary duties to its shareholders will result in Elon's ouster and/or $TSLA cratering into oblivion. This post is my opinion and not legal or investment advice, and I have no idea what I'm talking about. 

**SeC AcTioN**. Under Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC will come and take your tendies and call you a bad boy if you ""make any untrue statement of a material fact or...omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made...not misleading...in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,"" assuming you knew or were reckless in not knowing that your statement (or lack thereof) was wrongful.

*2018 Tweets: Here Come the Feds*

On August 7, 2018, Elon tweeted, ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" After this infamous tweet, $TSLA rose by more than 6% and closed up almost 11% from the previous day. About six weeks later, the SEC filed a complaint alleging, in part, that Elon's statement was ""false and misleading."" Further, the SEC alleged that ""\[o\]ver the next three hours, Musk made a series of additional materially false and misleading statements via Twitter including: 

* 'My hope is \*all\* current investors remain with Tesla even if we're private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla.'
* 'Shareholders could either to \[sic\] sell at 420 or hold shares &amp; go private.'
* 'Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it's contingent on a shareholder vote.'""

The SEC asserted that ""Musk knew or was reckless in not knowing that each of these statements was false and/or misleading because he did not have an adequate basis in fact for his assertions,"" explaining that Elon had not in fact secured funding and had not confirmed support of Tesla's investors. These false and misleading statements, the SEC argued, ""caused significant confusion and disruption in the market for Tesla's stock and resulting harm to investors,"" and constituted a violation of Rule 10b-5. 

As you well know, Elon and the Federales settled their spat. Elon stepped down as the chairman of Tesla's board, paid a $20 million penalty, and agreed to ""comply with all mandatory procedures implemented by Tesla, Inc. regarding (i) the oversight of communications relating to the Company made in any format, including, but not limited to, posts on social media (e.g., Twitter), \[Tesla's\] website (e.g., \[Tesla's\] blog), press releases, and investor calls, and (ii) the pre-approval of any such written communications that contain, or reasonably could contain, information material to \[Tesla\] or its shareholders...."" All was gravy, and Elon went back to his choccy milk and tendies...for a while. 

*2019 Tweet: Here Come the Feds*

Not one to kowtow to federal enforcement agencies or courts, Elon fired off another tweet on February 19, 2019, contravening Tesla's official production guidance. Specifically, Tesla issued guidance estimating that it would deliver between 360k and 400k total cars in 2019, and Elon tweeted that Tesla ""will make around 500k in 2019."" To his lawyer's credit, he backtracked quickly, but it was too late: the Federales saddled up and roped him back into court. In April of 2019, Elon and the SEC amended their settlement agreement to impose more specific restrictions on Elon's greasy fingers. After April 30, 2019, Elon would need Tesla's securities lawyer to pre-approve any public, written communication containing information about Tesla's financial condition, statements, or results, including earnings or guidance, potential or proposed transactions, actual or estimated production numbers, and a bunch of other shit, including any topic that Tesla believed needs pre-approval. All was gravy, and Elon went back to his choccy milk and tendies...for a while. 

*2020 Tweet: Here Come the Feds?*

Today, May 1, 2020, Elon fired off another tweet that has drawn the ire of Tesla option holders, shareholders, and, no doubt, board members: ""Tesla stock price is too high imo."" Do you see the difference between this tweet and the tweets discussed above? This tweet does not contain information, or at least that's what Elon and his lawyers will say if the SEC comes knocking. In particular, they will argue that this statement does not defraud investors and is not ""an untrue statement of material fact."" Rather, this is a statement of opinion. In fact, this might be the first (but surely not the last) instance where the caveat ""imo"" saves the writer from federal prosecution. This defense may or may not work, and if it does, the $TSLAQ trolls will sob that the plutocracy has impunity and corporate America is a house of cards glued together with the blood of Labor.

In light of Elon's history flouting the SEC's authority, the SEC may well pursue action for Elon's tweet, but their case would be thinner than it was in 2018 and 2019. Not to fear, $TSLAQ: the dump is not over.

**Here Come the Stockholders**. Tesla is a Delaware corporation subject to Delaware law, and Elon is its Chief Executive Officer. Until 2009, it was unclear whether corporate officers of Delaware corporations had the same fiduciary duties as corporate directors. In 2009, however, the Delaware Supreme Court held that officers' fiduciary duties to a corporation and its stockholders are identical to directors' fiduciary duties. In fact, corporate officers may have more duties and be less protected from breach of those duties than directors. 

At a minimum, corporate officers owe their corporation and its stockholders duties of loyalty and good care. For example, directors and officers have an ""affirmative duty to protect the interests of the corporation, but also an obligation to refrain from conduct which would injure the corporation and its stockholders or deprive them of profit or advantage."" Under common law agency principles, a corporate officer may also be considered an agent of its corporation (acting through the board), and thus have a duty of obedience. Do you think Elon's tweet today showed loyalty to Tesla and its stockholders? 

Under Tesla's bylaws, last amended on February 1, 2017, Tesla's CEO serves ""at the discretion of the board of directors."" The CEO has, ""subject to the supervision, direction and control of the board of directors, ultimate authority for decisions relating to the supervision, direction and management of the affairs and the business of the corporation customarily and usually associated with the position of CEO...."" However, any officer, including the CEO, can be removed, either with or without cause, by vote of the  majority of the board. It's unclear what the board might consider to be ""cause"" for removal, but Tesla's indemnification obligations to its officers provide some insight. Under its bylaws, Tesla will indemnify its officers, to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law, for third party actions and actions by or in the right of Tesla, as long as the officer ""acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of \[Tesla\]."" When Elon fired off his tweet today, do you think he reasonably believed it was in the best interests or not opposed to the best interests of Tesla? 

Even if the board wants to give Elon a pass, they will be under fire from actual investors (not you) whose interests were harmed by his tweet, opinion or not. Investors who lost big today (think pensions and hedge funds) are angry and have counsel. They will want Elon or Tesla to make them whole, and they will want to make sure this doesn't happen again. Because of his history flouting the SEC and federal court orders, Elon (and Tesla, if they stand behind him) will find courts unsympathetic to his cause. 

**Edit**: I’ve seen a few theories positing that Elon intentionally tanked the stock for one reason or another. Whether that is true or not, I doubt he realized that officers, and not just directors, have fiduciary duties to stockholders. After resigning as Chairman, Elon described himself as the Nothing of Tesla. Since Tesla burns through GCs faster than the Fremont factory burns cash, there was no one around to let him know that CEOs are not immune from liability. Vigilante he may be, but no one likes court.

**TL;DR**: for his tweet today, Elon and Tesla will face lawsuits from stockholders and maybe the SEC. The board of Tesla will be under fire for not acting in the wake of his previous conduct. Heads will roll, and Elon's role at Tesla will change.

1754,Discussion,Population ratios effects on the stock market,5,gbrxja,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gbrxja/population_ratios_effects_on_the_stock_market/,11,1588401036.0,"So i was [reading this](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2004/01/2004a_bpea_geanakoplos.pdf) thought it was interesting. They take they comapre younger working adults to middle age (age 40-65) working adults to try to predict the stock market. The basic theory is that younger adults(age 20-39) are likely to take out debt and be broke from having kids vs middle age whom would be investing and building their retirement.

Now, i was interested in a different ratio: the **retired population vs the working population**, defined as:

\-working population age 19-64

\-retired popuation 65+

My general thesis is that the working population serves as buyers into the stock market and the retired population serves as eventually sellers in the stock market. And yes, im aware many retiress stay invested, but they stop adding to their accounts and begin to make withdrawals overall. **I'll post the data in the comment section** to make this post easier to read.

In 1950 the ratio is about 10x, meaning there are 10 working class buying stocks for every 1 retiree withdrawaling from stocks. Today that ratio has steadily decreased and to about 6x and will be 3.5x by the time many of you retire.

Food for thought: how many new buyers does it take to replace one seller? Adjusted for inflation, the dow jones has made 1,000% gains since the 1950s, so does it take 10x new buyers to displace a seller with 1,000% return? luckily they are not cashing out 100% and only take out what they need to spend each month. So we stay afloat with only 6x new buyers for every 1 retired seller.

I summarize from multiple sources, if there's any glaring errors blame CNBC and Bloomberg.   


**04/26 Bank Of Japan Stimulus -** The bank of Japan (BOJ) will be having a meeting 04/26 to discuss further stimulus for the Japanese economy and is expected to remove buying limits of government bonds, and increase purchases of commercial and corporate debt. Though it should be noted that Japanese corporations are considered to be better positioned to weather the shut down, compared to corporations in other countries. This is due in large part to the high amount of cash reserves Japanese corporations keep on hand. It is currently estimated that Japanese corporations have $4.8 trillion of cash in their reserves. This places them in an excellent position to not only maintain operations, but also make future financial investments during this downturn. In addition, a record amount of publicly traded companies have chosen to suspend dividend payments until the economy reopens. A loan program is said to be on the table as well for companies who are struggling with cash flow.

**04/26 Deficit and Spending**\- The US budget deficit is expected to increase to 3.7trillion for this period as US spending rises fighting the coronavirus while the economy contracts. The previously projected budget deficit for 2020 was 1.083 trillion. Since the start of the lockdowns in the US, GDP is believed to have contracted 3.9% for the first quarter and possibly as much as 40% for the second quarter.

Steve Mnuchin on Sunday stated that we were “In a War” and that “Everything that needs to be done to support the economy will be done”. He was encouraged by the fact that interest rates remain low between 0-.25% in the US, and believes that the US economy will “...really bounce back in July, August, and September.”

Many economists remain concerned about the rising level of US debt, as treasury bond rates remain at record lows, worried that investor interest may wane on Treasury bonds. The current rate on the 10 year yield is .6%, 4X lower than it was a year ago when the yield was at 2.5%. Although, there has been an uptick in foreign interest for US Treasury bonds throughout Europe and Japan as they have seen their interest rates drop to negative levels. China is currently the largest buyer of US treasury bonds, and owns the largest amount of US debt measured at approximately 5%(1.07 Trillion). Under negative interest rates, people and businesses would actually have to pay the banks to store their money rather than make any passive income from interest payments.

Even before Covid19 shut down the US economy, massive spending has been a concern for many economists, as our spending has far outpaced economic growth since the last recession. Post 2009 Federal spending was kept between 2-3% as to not outpace the growth of the economy. During the Great Recession, spending on economic stimulus and overseas wars caused US spending to balloon to 24% of GDP, greatly adding to our debt at a much faster rate than previously. After the Great Recession spending was never reduced back to previous levels, instead the government began withdrawing funding from government funded organizations such as the military and medicare. A practice known as sequestering.

It’s impossible to know the full range of consequences that the US will face due to its additional massive spending combating Covid19 but it is generally agreed upon that eventually taxes will have to increase, and the US may face the possibility of another credit downgrade if our debt remains unchecked.  The US saw its first credit downgrade two years after the end of the Great Recession in 2011.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/27  **Oil Markets -** Oil had a rough Monday to start off the week. At the time of this writing June contracts for WTI are down 23% and trading at $13 a barrel. The popular oil index USO is also down 15% trading at $2.17. The two seem to be correlated as USO announces that they have begun offloading their June contracts out of fear those contracts would turn negative. The CME futures exchange has begun regulating the amount of contracts USO will be allowed to hold, warning them not to exceed their limits. This was done in an effort to prevent large unnecessary swings in the price of oil that do not reflect market conditions. Despite regulations supply still outpaces demand, and storage is also becoming an increasing worry for the oil producers. It is estimated about 85% of the world oils reserves are full at the moment. Producers are trying to come up with storage solutions by storing oil on tankers and possibly in pipelines as storage space disappears.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/28 **Food Chain and Earnings** \- Trump intends to use the defense production act to keep food processing plants open to prevent disruptions in the food supply chain. Many processing plants have shut down, threatening to reduce the US meat processing capacity by 80%.

A flood of loan applications continues to crash the SBA website as bankers attempt to submit many applications on behalf of their clients. After the initial $342 billion was loaned out in less than 2 weeks, an additional $310 billion was approved by congress to loan out to small businesses who were unable to receive aid during the first round of loans. It is predicted that the SBA will quickly loan out the additional $310 billion as well.

$GOOG beat on revenue causing their share price to jump around 8% during AH to above despite seeing a decrease in their ad revenue. $F reported a loss of 2 Billion for the previous quarter and predicted rough times ahead for the auto-industry. Shares fell greater than 5% during AH. AMD, SBUX also reported earnings during after market close and were trading lower during the after hours session.

$UBER announced after the market closed that they were planning on laying off 20% of their workforce. This is a little bit of speculation here, but I’d imagine California, New York, and Las Vegas all contribute greatly to Uber's revenue. Seeing how New York and California have extended lock downs throughout May, and Las Vegas workers do not feel safe returning to work despite the mayor pushing them to do so, Ubers main markets have been hit the hardest and will be closed the longest giving Uber a very bleak outlook.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/29 **Gilead & The Fed -** Gilead was halted during pre-market trading hours while they made an announcement that their target goal had been achieved during their patient study for the drug remedesivir. This was a study including over a 1000 patients in multiple countries that showed patients on the drug recovered faster than those in the placebo group. Trump is now looking to the FDA to fast track the approval of the drug. $GILD ended the trading day 5% higher at $83.

Jerome Powell announced that the Fed will be keeping interest rates unchanged at 0-.25% and stated that interest rates will remain unchanged until he is confident the economy is nursed back to health. He stated that “Q2 economic numbers will be the worst we’ve seen in history” and it will be a long recovery back to pre-covid 19 levels.

MSFT, TSLA, FB all reported positive earnings after the bell causing their stock price to rise during after hours trading.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/30 **Unemployment & PMI** \- Unemployment numbers were reported to be at 3.83M which is a decline from the previous reported number last week, bringing the total number of unemployed to above 30 million. The highest unemployment number reported thus far was 6.87 for the last week of March 28th, and has been in decline every week since. Chicago announced a PMI of 35.4 which was their lowest PMI number since 2009. The 10 year treasury note is trending downward back towards its all time low of .54%

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

04/30 **Trump & China -** Trump has stepped up his blame against China for the Corona Virus saying that they will face consequences for the damage it has caused. It is reported that possible sanctions, cancelling of US debt obligations, and new trade agreements were all being considered. This could potentially shake up investor confidence in a market that had previously rallied off of a trade agreement between the US and China earlier in the year.

US intelligence agencies are currently trying to determine if the virus had actually originated from the Wuhan Virology Center, and not the wet markets as China claims. Epidemiologist have thus far been unable to trace the virus back to a wet market adding to the suspicion that it was spread by an infected employee at the lab. Although it is important to note that scientists had determined Covid 19 was not man made, nor was it altered in a lab, often viruses are merely studied in Virology centers. Australia has also called out China and is asking for transparency and cooperation from the nation to determine the origins of the virus. China has responded by telling Australia they will “reduce economic cooperation with Australia” if they continue to mount pressure against China.

In regards to repercussions against China, Mike Pompeo said “Timing is important.” Due to the fragile state of both economies, China could harm the US economy just as easily as we could harm theirs. In addition, the US & China have been sharing resources such as ventilators, testing equipment, and personal protective gear in an effort to regain control and fight Covid 19.

Adding another layer of uncertainty to the world, Kim Jong-Un has yet to be seen since April 11th and many unconfirmed reports have come out about his health and possible location. There is some belief that Kim suffered a heart attack and is currently in a vegitative state and reports that Chinese medical team was dispatched to North Korea at some point during April. Other theories point to the leader simply being at one of his resorts likely hiding away from the public until the Covid 19 crisis is over. Although there has yet to be a single reported case of Covid 19 in North Korea.

 \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

05/01 **Elon, Fannie Mae, PMI Oh My -** “Sell in May and Go Away” proved true for the first of the month, as stocks sold off particularly hard due to reignited fears of Trump imposing tariffs on trade with China. Heading into the last hours of trading, all indexes are lower by greater than 2% with the Nasdaq down greater than 3%. PMI data for the month of April was also released this morning, ISM PMI was reported to be at 41.5 which is a decrease from March (49.1) indicating a further contraction of the economy. 

In the mortgage market, there are about 3.8million mortgages in forbearance which accounts for nearly 8% of all US mortgages. This is equivalent to about 841 billion in unpaid principal. Fannie May believes this number could double in the coming months if the economy does not reopen and unemployment continues to rise. Out of all the Mortgage lenders, the Federal housing and Veterans administration had the highest level of homes in forbearance (10%) which doesn’t come as too much of a shock as they offer loans to individuals with low credit scores and allow them to place a smaller down payment.

After the market closed, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the use of Remdesivir to treat Covid19 patients. Gilead has had a wild ride over the past two weeks due to conflicting information in their patient test trials, yet the general consensus at the moment is that Remdesivir has an obvious beneficial effects in treating Covid patients. 

JCrew joins the list of the companies expected to file for bankruptcy, and analysts believe many more bankruptcies will be on the way once liquidity starts drying up for more companies. TSLA which reported better than expected earnings this week, is obviously not going bankrupt, yet Elon oddly seemed to think their stock was over performing. After making comments today that the price of TSLA stock was too high, TSLA dropped from roughly $760 to a low of $686 before closing the day at $701 per share.

""I therefore determine that the unrestricted foreign supply of bulk-power system electric equipment constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, which has its source in whole or in substantial part outside the United States.  This threat exists both in the case of individual acquisitions and when acquisitions are considered as a class.  Although maintaining an open investment climate in bulk-power system electric equipment, and in the United States economy more generally, is important for the overall growth and prosperity of the United States, such openness must be balanced with the need to protect our Nation against a critical national security threat.  To address this threat, additional steps are required to protect the security, integrity, and reliability of bulk-power system electric equipment used in the United States.  **In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to the threat to the United States bulk-power system.**""

Yes, the market is forward looking, there was unprecedented stimulus, etc, but it's still kind of shocking.

TLDR: $SPCE lost its virginity. 

LAS CRUCES, N.M.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE) (“Virgin Galactic” or “the Company”) and The Spaceship Company (“TSC”) today announced the successful completion of its first SpaceShipTwo test flight from Spaceport America.

This glide flight marks the inaugural solo flight of VSS Unity in New Mexico and as such is an important flight test milestone in preparation for commercial service.

On SpaceShipTwo’s flight deck were Dave Mackay and CJ Sturckow who, together with the team in Mission Control, executed some of the key elements of a spaceflight profile. These included take-off and landing along with high-altitude release from the mothership, VMS Eve, which was piloted by Michael Masucci and Kelly Latimer.

The flight took off from the Spaceport America runway, with VSS Unity attached to the carrier aircraft, VMS Eve. The vehicles climbed to an altitude of 50,000ft before Unity was released, at which point VSS Unity flew freely for the first time in New Mexico airspace. The spaceship achieved a glide speed of Mach 0.70 and completed multiple test-points, before touching back down smoothly for a runway landing at Spaceport America.

This test flight was conducted under a set of stringent operational protocols to ensure safety against COVID-19. Its successful execution was made possible by a concerted effort to redesign all the operational elements required for safe flight test while meeting new health and wellness protocols. These protocols include changes to the work areas and procedures to enforce social distancing as advised by state guidelines as well as universal mask usage.

This flight milestone represents a major achievement which has been in the planning since SpaceShipTwo relocated to Virgin Galactic’s New Mexico commercial headquarters in February. Virgin Galactic also fully concluded the relocation of its spaceline operations team and their families to New Mexico.

This glide flight provided the first opportunity to test all the components required to fly the carrier aircraft and spaceship in glide configuration, from a new home base and in new airspace. Dave and CJ performed a series of maneuvers with VSS Unity designed to gather data about performance and handling qualities in order to enhance our aerodynamic modeling and verify against similar maneuvers that were performed earlier in Unity’s test flight program. The flight test also provided an opportunity for the pilots and spaceflight operations team to continue familiarisation with the new airspace around the Gateway to Space and a chance to capture valuable in-flight data and conduct further pilot training.

Friday’s flight successfully completed all test objectives. Virgin Galactic would like to express its thanks to New Mexico Spaceport Authority (NMSA), the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Albuquerque Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), and the FAA Air Traffic Control Center in Albuquerque for smooth coordination and efficient integration.

Preparation for the next flight will now begin, starting with an in depth analysis of today’s flight data.

George Whitesides, CEO of Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company said, “I’d like to congratulate our team for reaching this flight milestone, especially during these challenging times. I am grateful for the commitment displayed by everyone involved, not only in helping to support relief efforts in both New Mexico and California, but also for the dedication and creativity which will allow us to continue safely towards our goal of commercial launch.”

“Today’s VSS Unity flight is another exciting milestone for Virgin Galactic's progress in New Mexico. We are extremely happy and proud of Virgin Galactic, not only for today’s success but also for the exceptional way they have integrated into NM and supported the region and State during this stressful time dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Spaceport America and Virgin Galactic have adhered to new guidelines set by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to include social distancing and wearing masks. A big thank you to our foundational partner at Spaceport America!” said Dan Hicks, Executive Director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority.

there must be a reason behind this madness and I personally think it is because of the factory's that are shut down.
If tesla doesn't produce vehicles and can't sell them due to decrease in demand (covid-19) the costs and debts can't be paid off.
This will likely make Q2 of 2020 the worst quarter Tesla has ever seen and this could be a big stressor for Elon.

Now on top of this Elon was about to be awarded 750.000.000$ in stock options, which is incredibly controversial since the whole world is suffering from the beer virus health wise but also financially.

Elon is in a weird place.
His factory's aren't producing jack shit, but his stock is up humongously.

Pre-covid, worth $88 on average, currently $26, and market analysts (lul, i know), value it at $46.

The airline industry won't fail, and once covid is gone, people are going to travel because they are tired of being on house arrest.

Why is ""now"" not a good time to buy it, talk me out of it. Even if it goes down another 50%, average down and wait for the airline industry to pick up again. What am I missing about the airline industry going back up before this is over.

We had 5% at grocery stores on the Chase Freedom and overall fears about the virus.

I am sure all the data finance guys buy early is starting to show, and despite the FED pumping the markets up, Costco continued to slide despite being one of the most active businesses over the past 30 days.

Previous Strike - Sell 322.5C 5/8 for $5.00 premium and I closed it out for a 95% gain on the money. I could have let this ride, but why let a rogue way kill you?

I am looking for an earnings play, and to be honest, I think they Costco is going to be pretty shit. They increased their dividend, took out a new bond offering to pay the old one, and had CAPEX this Q with an acquisition of Last Mile Logistics for a billion.

Lastly, after posting my initial thread, the price of the strike mooned with the announcement of the dividend. I will have to remember that next time because I was almost -50% in a day. I still absolutely believed in the play, and just let it ride.

Earnings play is coming up, but IV is low so I may have to wait until 5/8 to see if I see an increase. I am bearish overall. I will post when I execute it.

As we are entering earnings season, many companies have started to release their Q1’2020 earnings and I believe the general consensus is that, they’re going to suck, because you know, Covid-19 happened. But what about the rest of 2020?

**Q2’2020, Q3’2020 earnings and possibly Q4’2020 earnings**

Here’s a few things I’m expecting regarding Q2’2020 and Q3’2020

I’m expecting many balance sheets using aggressive accounting methods to be “cleaned out”. This means that companies will switch from using aggressive revenue recognition, having inflated assets value and deferring their expenses to subsequent periods to recognizing their revenue when the payment is received, recognizing their assets at historical cost, and expensing their charges when they occur.

I believe they will use the Covid-19 pandemic as scapegoat to finally clean their balance sheet/income statements. But why now? Because earnings were going to suck anyways, might as well throw everything out right? You fucking bet. Expect a lot of non-cash charges (changes in accounting methods) and legacy costs which are costs incurred by a company in prior years under different leadership or when the entity's priorities and resources were different. Key words here: Different. Leadership. I believe newly appointed CEOs will the opportunity Covid-19 provides and throw everything out. They’re going to clean the closet. Skeletons are coming out boys and gals.

CEOs: “We were used to defer charges to next quarter? Yeah, let’s not fucking do that anymore. Who cares, earnings were going to fucking suck anyways. Oh, and by the way, I’m not the one to blame for this, it was past management’s fault.”

**Q1’2021 earnings**

So we know both Q2’2020, Q3’2020 and possibly Q4’2020 are going to suck ass. But what about Q1’2021 earnings tho? The exact opposite; they’re going to be gangbusters. Why? Because not only Y/Y they’re being compared to Q1’2020 which were pretty much non-existent, but all those legacy costs and accounting changes will be accounted for/priced in. And the new CEOs will look like godsend individuals. And the hammered companies will bounce back.

Knowing this, here’s a list of newly appointed CEOs (2019 and 2020) :

· IBM (IBM)                               

· Disney (DIS)

· Rite Aid (RAD)                       

· Accenture (ACN)

· Fox Corportation (FOX)       

· Cognizant (CTSH)

· HSBC (HSBC)                          

· ViacomCBS (VIAB)

· SAP (SAP)                                

· Boeing (BA)

**TLDR:** Worse than expected earnings for the rest of the year for companies with newly appointed CEOs, and gangbusters in 2021.",2020-05-01 18:18:09,0.5661,0.4019,-0.34,0.2093333333333333

1. They are making a killing

The cost of pulling these rocks out of the ground stays roughly the same regardless of whether business is boom or bust. That means that profit is through the roof right now as the price of gold is high. Even if the price of gold does not keep going up, if it bounces around at this range or even a little lower, these gold mining companies are still going to continue making money hand-over-fist. 

2. Low interest rates drive the price of gold up

Regardless of what you think about hoarding yellow bricks, gold is still a safe haven for boomers, especially when their other safe havens are sucking. When their CDs and annuities are paying jack shit, you can't keep them away from it. We know the Fed is going to keep interest rates at zero for the foreseeable future and it is entirely likely that we will see rates go negative. Low rates are great but negative rates would be rocket fuel.

3. It doesn't matter that much what SPY is doing

A lot of people are getting eaten alive right now trying to figure out whether the S&P 500 is going to go up or down this week. When the conditions are right like they are now, gold miners are going to be making bank regardless of what the S&P 500 is doing.

This is Tyson's largest plant. They started temporarily closing this week to 'clean'. Now 15% have tested positive. The plant workers are scared to go back. It is scary since in the surrounding counties, Dakota County (Dakota City and South Sioux) has 700 covid-19 cases and Sioux City has 742. Tyson can be traced to 46% of those cases.

The Waterloo plant closed from having 43% being traced back to Tyson. The Dakota City plant is more than double its size. I hope it doesn't close indefinitely, but it surely isn't looking good.

What does this mean for you? Well these are all radically different markets (especially now) and this is actually WAY more conservative than even their USL fund. Which means any run up on WTI crude prices will see very little transfer to your USO gain. Basically the entire freaking curve has to move up at the same time if you want to make any money. 

So you open up and see the front-month WTI crude contract has shot through the roof on May 15th, you get all excited and can't wait to sell out and rake in those sweet massive profits, only to see USO barely moved because all their positions are spread out across different crude grades and also gasoline and diesel prices!

So if you have calls, sorry to say your gains have now had their legs cut out from underneath them. You could be a 100% right on your WTI prediction but not see shit for gains.

Sounds like an impending disaster.

I have an auto loan with them and they sent me a letter saying that automatic payments must be cancelled more than three business days in advance, despite what I was ""inadvertently"" informed when I signed up for automatic payments on the app. That sounds desperate.

On the sub r/CapitalOne, the last few posts are from folks who are not immediately getting credit for credit card payments. I can confirm as a Capital One customer that ordinarily I receive credit immediately upon payment. This, again, sounds desperate.

I think Capital One is going to great lengths to shore up its balance sheet by pulling out all the stops their customers agreed to in the fine print and may be involved in locking down the sub r/CapitalOne. 

Capital One is a lender that will be hit hard by the coronavirus depression. Many of its customers are barely able to pay their bill - in fact this is their entire business model according to the article linked to on my previous post about Capital One.

I have set up my Charts and Trade tab to be linked so I can quickly send a ticker to a color code i.e. ""Red"" where it will send it to my charts and Trade tab to quickly screen the ticker. 

From scanning last week I have 3 tickers that stood out after a preliminary screen and light DD. I am spending the weekend digging deeper. I posted one or two of these the last few days in other discussions as well.  I think CNX had a couple good comments from others with some possible explanations for the unusual activity. 


#CNX 
CNX Resources Corporation, also called CNX Resources, is an oil and gas company. The firm engages in the exploration, development, production, gathering, processing and acquisition of natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin.


This is the one I am most interested in. Their earnings were terrible, but to be expected in an oil and gas company.

- 32K open interest for 17Jul20 6P. As of Friday 1MAY there was about 17k volume. I will know on Monday if more positions were opened or closed. 
- 28k puts for OCT 5p. As of Friday there was an additional 2k in volume, again,  I will know more on Monday if open vs close. 
- I only found 10k calls for OCT to be the closest ""hedge"" if you could call it that, but on Friday there was about the same volume as OI. It could be someone closing their call position, or opening a larger position. I'll know more on monday. 

u/rredditscum pointed [this out](https://www.timesherald.com/news/state/cnx-resources-corporation-announces-closing-of-300-million-of-convertible-senior-notes-and-full-exercise/article_c54a2ea4-a9e0-5914-a8ec-aee4f7b4c3d1.html). With the comment ""Maybe preparing for bankruptcy?"". Which was a good find and very possible scenario. 

#WMGI 
Wright Medical Group NV engages in the provision of medical device products. It operates through the following segments: U.S. Lower Extremities and Biologics; U.S. Upper Extremities; International Extremities and Biologics; and Corporate. The U.S. Lower Extremities and Biologics includes the sale of its lower extremities products, such as joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle; and biologics products used to support treatment of damaged or diseased bone, tendons, and soft tissues or to stimulate bone growth. The U.S. Upper Extremities segment focuses on joint implants and bone fixation devices for the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand; and products used across several anatomic sites to mechanically repair tissue-to-tissue or tissue-to-bone injuries, and other ancillary products.

- 21AUG2020 25P @ 10k orders

I found this [article]( https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/20/04/g15882970/stryker-extends-cash-tender-offer-for-all-outstanding-shares-of-wright-medical). They could be rejecting or accepting possible buyout offer from Stryker? 

u/Dimeskis pointed out A 10k multi-leg spread was purchased around noon. So its a spread, not 20k in naked puts...half of the options were sold by the investor, not purchased. Also, both legs were sold/bought at the mid price...so you don't know if its a debit or credit spread. Heck, it looks like the further OTM ($25) strike was closer to the ask then the bid, which might mean its a credit spread (the investor had to buy closer to the ask to get 10k worth of puts). You can't say for certain and if it is a credit spread then you're fucked.



#DRE 
Duke Realty Corp. operates as a real estate development company, which specializes in the ownership, management and development of industrial and medical office properties. It offers property and asset management, leasing, construction and other tenant related services. 

- 19JUN 30P @ 2500 orders (Around $262,500.00.

This is the one I have done the least bit of research on. I will dive into it more this weekend. It sticks out to me for 2 reasons, first just the abnormality of the puts/call ratio and the sheer volume. Secondly, this equates to roughly 10% of their average trading volume. Maybe I am wrong in thinking that is unusual?

As of now I do not hold any positions, but will move into positions on CNX and WMGI over the next week. I will update if I do anything with DRE as well as what my positions are.

Buying Put debit spreads until we start to trend back down.***
 
Executive Summary:

1.	The Federal Reserve balance sheet rate of additions has decreased as we have come out of the initial shock period
2.	Interest rates / Liquidity are the focus for the Fed, rather than the price of equities
3.	Consumer spending behavior has shifted, and we need to model these emerging changes in our 2020+ equities pricing
4.	Reopening of the US before adequate measures are in place introduces further market downside risk, with a new spike of cases building and presenting by Mid May
5.	Oil and other commodities are showing the supply and demand disruptions of the shutdown and present a volatility / market sell trigger in Mid May
6.	Remdesivir and other drug and vaccine developments are too optimistic and there is a high degree of downside risk if there are setbacks or failures

You don’t need a thousand words to know the economy is messed up right now. What Bears might need, after taking a pounding through April and getting jacked to the tits off the first smidge of red, is to tap the breaks a minute. A walkthrough of what to look for, what events are coming up, and how things might change throughout May.

***1.*** Federal Reserve Intervention – how much has the Fed added to their balance sheet since the beginning of this crisis? Jan 20, 2020: 4.2 Trillion USD to ~6.7 Trillion today. Over the past month and a half, we saw the Fed add to their weekly purchases by up to 586 Billion USD (Mar 25th) dropping down to 82.8 Billion this past Wednesday. This change might be attributed to our moving past the initial liquidity crisis phase of the CV epidemic, and onto the solvency crisis phase.

29-Apr-20	|6655.9|	82.8
 
***2.*** Interest Rates – Negative yield on the US 10yr. means a world of further hurt for the economy, and retirees specifically. Negative rates have had a net negative effect on growth in other countries (Japan, European Union) and the US has so far avoided this phenomenon. A theory tying the rate of balance sheet additions by the Fed to the US 10yr. yield, would be the Fed is targeting a low but positive rate of ~0.60%, by setting the overnight lending rate (0.50%) and ensuring lending and liquidity in markets through balance sheet additions. With rates at 0.60% right now, and the goal to avoid negative for the time being, the Fed feels their objectives are satisfied and have held rates and slowed their additions. 

In his speech on April 29th, Jerome Powell made an unusual and direct comment to Congress regarding the interventions made to date, and that they may need to intervene again, “if the recovery is to be a robust one”. My takeaway from this: liquidity and interest rates are problems which the Fed can address. On the other side, a company can only operate so long without revenue, and it is in this arena that Congress must step up. The growing solvency crisis (CHK, HTZ, Any retail store) is something which is outside of the Fed’s ability to control – they cannot print money, and even the junk bond “special purpose vehicle” maneuver is borderline beyond their powers. I think the market should have taken Powell’s speech as a more desperate, starkly negative signal but either way I am convinced the Fed is not the unlimited money printing machine of lore, but rather the wrong institution with the wrong tools to tackle this crisis.       

***3.*** Equities Market– No company was built to weather a crisis like this. Major changes in consumer behavior will develop. Already, we see savings skyrocketing as consumers are less inclined to spend, but there are many other potential economic changes which will change the makeup of our economy once things are “back to normal”: 

More remote work might mean tech companies growth, but metro real estate’s demise
Restaurants have so many challenges ahead it actually makes me sad to think about 
Car usage has plummeted but there are further disruptions which this week rocked GM and F – rental companies are at risk of bankruptcy. Hertz the focus now, but others are in a similar position. Tens of thousands of used cars flooding the market on a liquidation of Hertz would implode Detroit. 
Just three examples… Companies’ revenues have been disrupted in a way which has never been seen. The future remains uncertain, but any further extension of lockdown, spike in cases/ deaths, means reduced earnings. Lower earnings, stock values which are still near ATH’s = P/E ratios that look even more overvalued (I won’t address the weakness of the global economy prior to the CV outbreak, but it is a critical part of our present situation).   

***4.*** Reopening of US States – herein lies the catch 22. Reopen states = end economic suffering, right? Well, you cannot demand that consumers spend. Consumers need to have faith and money to spend back at Jan 2020 levels. A reopen does not immediately solve this challenge, and a few weeks into May this will start to be obvious. To reopen, we needed see consistent reductions in new cases of Covid, a high degree of testing, and contact tracing. The magic formula. We lack this completely. US testing growth has stagnated. Just as the corona virus grew exponentially, so should our testing numbers have. Instead, we have flattened both curves, and set ourselves up for a massive failure. This is my key trigger for sharp selloff, as I believe it is the most concrete way to say, “until the US government gets its shit together, or we have a vaccine/ treatment, the economy is broken.” 

***5.*** Oil / WTI June Contract Expiration Approach –Again, Macrovoices does a thorough job. In a nutshell: the market may misinterpret signals from the oil market in the next weeks, leading up to the middle of May. It currently appears we are not filling the oil capacity as quickly as thought, however, this is a due to floating storage (tankers) being utilized and storage at the WTI contract settlement location (Cushing, OK) being already at “working” rather than “theoretical” max capacity. We cannot simply shut off production capacity from oil wells, since there is a huge risk to equipment and the health of the well itself, so it is not likely that we reduced crude production / increased consumption at the rate implied in this week’s storage utilization numbers. The dynamics involved here will play out as futures contracts near expiry, beginning potentially in the mid of May and leading up to the May 19th settlement date.  

***6.*** Remdesivir – Risk risk risk. More than any other news event, this drug and positive / negative announcements have massively swung prices. https://twitter.com/MarkHoofnagle/status/1256242036015063042 Threads like these are a reminder that negative news on drug / vaccine development will be an instant trigger for the markets, up or down.

My positions: SPY 5/20 275/265 and SPY 6/5 270/260. Taking profits early. Keeping cash on the sidelines to be ready to roll my positions out and up if the rally goes higher. I am looking to get more aggressive with my puts as we approach the events I outlined above.

You might remember me from [last week's DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8od1g/cacc_subprime_autoloans_are_totally_gonna_go_tits/), in which I argued that a company whose entire business model consists of exploiting the poor is worthy of your totally un-earned NEET bux. In today's not financial advice we are going to talk about the currency without a state, the oldest medium of trade, Scrooge McDuck's drug of choice...I'm talking about gold.

Now, there is a reason that commercial advertisements for gold target demographics that we will generously call ""unsophisticated"". Gold is perfect for short term thinkers/investors because doesn't actually grow in the long term the way equities or bonds do. But to understand the powerful short term play I'm talking about, we need to understand the role gold actually plays in the international monetary system.

After WW2, the Allied powers got together and realized that they needed a way to avoid the hyperinflation of 1930's Germany which had led to the war. In order to ensure currency stability the entire world agreed to peg their currencies to USD. And USD would be backed by gold. If one of the currencies was too much in demand, threatening the carefully managed exchange rates, than the IMF would step in and pump or dump the currency until it returned to the right exchange rate.

That system worked great until around 1971, when Nixon lost tons of the government's tendies napalming rice paddies. The US government paid for the war with debt, and by 1971, Nixon was afraid of actually getting margin called. So he, with no notice to anyone, announced that the US dollar was no longer backed by gold. Suddenly it was a free for all. The US economy was hit with both high unemployment and high inflation, other currencies floated all over the place. Basically, it was the chaos we have today.

So Duncan, you might ask, does anyone buy gold today? Well, almost every central bank in the world continues to hold gold, and lots of it. The reason they do so is the same reason almost all historic currencies were based on gold: that because gold can't easily be printed, it can't be easily be manipulated, and it can't easily be degraded or destroyed. In fact, it's perks strongly parallel those of Bitcoin. In the event of a crisis, a country can liquidate its gold reserves for more currency. This is especially helpful when a reserve currency, or the native currency is in trouble. For example, we see Venezuela, whose own currency is totally worthless, USD reserves are useless due to sactions, and therefore it has turned to its gold reserves to pay for imports of food and medicine.

Gold's reputation as a systemic-risk hedge is so great, that in times of market instability or crisis, it actually assumes a negative beta. That is, it moves opposite equities. However because it is an almost fixed quantity asset, it also changes value against other currencies. So, when we have our friend Jerome running his printer like crazy, increasing the [money supply at an unprecedented rate](https://imgur.com/a/dT62Gbh), he should be increasing the price of gold, or rather, making the USD/Gold exchange rate higher. In fact, we see that around late 2018 the trump tax cut began to pump more liquidity into an already hot economy, [starting a USD/Gold price increase](https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html). Likewise, as the world economies look more and more risky, and the world's reserve currency's M2 expands faster than Boogie2988 after a breakup; we should see central banks continue to purchase gold as a hedge against continued economic instability.

The Fed has made it clear, that it will do everything possible to avoid deflation. However, after 10 years of historically low interest rates and at times QE, consumers simply have not seen wages or prices increase significantly. So where has that steadily increasing money supply gone? Well, the answer appears to be that some assets are experiencing inflation: Financial instruments, urban housing, medical care, and college tuition--anything that can be funded through cheap debt--have taken the brunt of inflation. Meanwhile the average American consumer can't even find 4 hundred dollar bills to rub together in an emergency. So we can be almost certain that the Fed will keep printing, in the misguided belief that its freshly minted money will eventually trickle down to the American consumer, but in the process the Fed will raise the price of stocks, bonds, houses, colleges, medicine, and most importantly gold.

As we have discussed, gold is good for two things: hedging inflation, and reducing systematic risk. And right now, both of those traits are looking very, very valuable.

Edit: Since every post I get accused of pump and dump, I will disclose my current related positions: UGLD, and about 1-1.5 oz of physical gold. I include an option recommendation for the algos, but honestly, if you don't know how to gain exposure to gold, this post probably won't help you.

I crosschecked each ship against the year build just to be sure. It seems NAT sails their ships using 3 flags: Bahamas, Cayman Islands, and Marshall Islands. 


[NAT 2019 Form 20-F](https://www.nat.bm/category/reports/annual-reports/) - page 52


While this data doesn't tell you who is contracting the ships or the value of the contracts, we can get an idea of how often NAT ships go from port to port. I'd imagine that the management is smart enough to make the most of their ships so when I see something like Nordic Cygnus's 4/11 arrival at Long Beach and no port after that, my guess is that NAT among one of the many tankers outside LB storing oil at VERY high rates.


I also noticed that many ships are taking about 1-2 weeks between port. We can't assume those are 1-2 week contracts as perhaps they're working with a producer who has a more complex contract. Either way, we can see that their ships are moving often and plentifully.

We would want to try to have multiple people validate each other from each city and also try to hit every day of the week. I’m thinking this would be along the lines of the unemployment claims estimates we were all doing but with less bullshit and speculation.

And don’t worry about what you think about fundamentals or what the stock price should or shouldn’t be over the next six to twelve months. Doesn’t matter.

When interest rates declined, the stock market recovered. 

In the 2000-2003 crash, extremely high speculation in the stock market started the decline and 9/11 was the cherry on top. Once stocks rebalanced to a regular/ expected level, and the US popped into Afghanistan, the market recovered. 

In the 2007-2009 crash, the debt in the mortgage market and the cost of two ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq caused the crash. The cost of the mortgage market debacle was finally determined in March 09, and the market started its slow recovery. 

The root cause of the 2020 crash is the beeflue. The stat models say the worst is over and the market did see a bottom (unsure if its true bottom, okay). Actions by the Fed and gov have sparked the recovery. 

Now, on Wednesday the market was a buying frenzy with the announcement of a “successful” drug trial for the cure of beerflu. 

So when will the market recover? Well once the root cause of the problem is determined, yeah, it’s on its way. 

So where is the opportunity for tendies? Well it’s best when market sentiments are at extremes. You get to bet against this and maximize those tendies.

So what is the sentiment? Well, people, the media and experts are all being conservative. And with a surprise; we’ll see a violent swing. Public officials have already set the bar very low.

Preferably on a company with a cheap underlying...and a business that even wsb can comprehend?

$TACO (Del Taco) reports earnings on Monday AMC, here is why it’s going up and how to play it:

1) QSRs (quick service restaurants) will benefit disproportionally from pandemic per several studies

2) 99% of del taco restaurants have drive thrus, per 10-K. Per company statement on 4/2, 85% of their sales PRE corona were from drive through + takeout

3) MEANINGFUL insider buying before and after pandemic, and mgmt team increasingly focused on execution. mgmt team is aligned with shareholders and has said theyre willing to sell company if opportunity presents itself. (I’m not banking on this short term but it’s cheap and attractive business (ill get to this in moment)). also mgmt team came out last week and said theyre all taking 20% pay cuts. they’d rather the stock go up.

4) CHEAP STOCK. $189M market cap was valued by PE at $500M a few years ago. p/b of 0.65, forward p/e 14, little l/t debt, strong fcf 

5) strong customer base that loves the food. go on twitter and reddit and search del taco. look at google trends and search glassdoor reviews. loyal customers. Lot of Glassdoor reviews saying it’s always busy and understaffed

6) increased and timely marketing that will finally present itself in q1. They introduced the app and have been pumping coupons since start of 2020. and it will drive sales. Also go on youtube and look up del taco on SNL; the skit with Adam Driver is actually fucking funny and it was the first SNL skit of 2020. effective marketing is effective. AW MAN IM ALL OUT OF CASH

7) they have already pulled guidance which dropped stock, should fall even if bad er

8) other random thoughts: stock doesnt screen well (go on finviz youll see comps missing). everyone loves tacos, there arent many fast food mexican restaurants in USA, there’s really just taco bell and i suppose cmg. also the demographic market of the chain (southwest and west coast) increases effectiveness of branding and helps the growth argument throughout country. also the mgt team has been closing restaurants that arent profitable since last year, this will help bottom line and tailwind going forward 

TLDR: everybody loves cheap tacos, tendies will rain on cinco de mayo. $TACO calls

An Uber eats competitor (Foodora) has just up and left Canada with about two weeks notice, citing profitability issues [CBC News article] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5546642). Note they indicate the competitive landscape is rough in Canada. This is no different than the US with the exact same players everywhere. And Foodora operated a lot out of major cities that are similar in size and density to US cities (Toronto, Montreal). I believe this is a great indicator of upcoming shittier-news-than-expected for Ubers earnings call. 

Now seeing as how Uber eats is one of the only theorized things to be making money for Uber these days, they are clearly suffering what Amazon is in that revenue may be there (maybe it isn't even there really), but profit isn't. Earnings are may 7th and it should drill to 25 I would say if earnings miss something like 30%+ from revised consensus. Now I know I will catch some ""priced in"" shade, but the market is irrational right now and the stock is irrationally high for a company that already lost fuck tons of money under normal circumstances, and now can't get any fucking volume.

Consider this background due diligence because the market is closed.

Most of you retards lack an historical perspective on current events, so I’m writing this to give you the bigger picture on the casino and stock market history of the president. If you’re going to waste money it should be spent on recreational drugs and strippers- it stimulates the economy and probably does less long term damage to your net worth. But since this million retard army persists in making dumb bets, I will give you some background about the President because to most of you, the only Grey Lady you know is your own mother.

On May 8th, 2019, the president tweeted, “You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes. . . . [...] and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport. Additionally, the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!” The leader of the free world bragged about losing money, said it was financially advantageous, said it was fun, and also said it was fake.

[The president had some successes- but no one goes on this sub for incremental or sustainable traditional business wins. So as to not sound biased, I will include some of them. Feel free to skip this part. His first “deal” was a purchase by his father in Trump’s senior year of high school. Purchased for $5.6 million plus half a million in renovations, it sold eight years later for $6.75 million. Result- a racial discrimination lawsuit and a $650,000 profit. In “The Art of the Deal”, the president claimed this was a $6 million profit. In 1970, Paris is Out, a Broadway comedy, lost him $70,000- inflation adjusted about half a million dollars today. In 1971, he was made president of the 14,000 apartment owning company, changed the name to the Trump Organization, and was again sued for racial discrimination. In 1978 he was the agent for Penn Central’s sale of the current Javits Center, for which he was paid a commission, and then became the face of the redevelopment of the Commodore Hotel. A $70 million loan guaranteed by his father and Hyatt Hotels, in addition to $1 million revolving credit from Chase bank, financed the renovation- which obtained a 40 year tax abatement. He then went on to build Trump Plaza, which he sold as individually owned apartments- known as a cooperative, in 1981. In 1986, he successfully renovated Wollman Ice Rink on time and three quarters of a million dollars under budget.]

In 1980 building site preparations began at the Trump Tower location. The previous building had some artistically significant architectural details, which were promised to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and instead were destroyed. The demolition crew was a group of 200 strong ""Polish Brigade"" immigrants who worked 12 hour shifts. By using illegal labor, the president was able to avoid contributions to the pension fund and union worker welfare fund- the workers were paid $4-$5 per hour. Details are sealed after 16 years in court. Construction began in 1982 on Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, and in the first six months of opening in 1985, made only $144,000 in profit. In 1986 he bought out his partner, Harrahs, for $70 million. During this time he also purchased Trump Marina (ne Castle) for $325 million; this was the property at which his father bought $3.5 million in casino chips and never used, and which he was fined for making an illegal casino loan. In 1988, he bought the Plaza Hotel in New York for $390 million. He said in The New York Times, ""For the first time in my life, I have knowingly made a deal that was not economic – for I can never justify the price I paid, no matter how successful the Plaza becomes."" Another $50 million in renovations caused the total debt service to be too expensive; the prepackaged bankruptcy resulted in a $250 million dollar loss for creditors and a lowered interest rate in exchange for 49% of the hotel. Three years later the Saudis would buy a controlling stake.

Trump Plaza Casino followed the same game plan as the Plaza Hotel: he owed $250 million and conducted a prepackaged bankruptcy due to sky high debt service. The bankruptcy converted the $250 million into $300 million longer term debt, then went on to conduct a $42 million dollar expansion in 1993, and a $48 million dollar expansion in 1995. It closed in 2018 and the property was foreclosed on by Carl Ichan.

In 1988, he bought and renovated the Taj Mahal for nearly a billion dollars, financed with junk bonds at 14%. When he couldn’t make the payments, the property was again put into a prepackaged bankruptcy. Ironically, the Taj Mahal may have hastened the downfall of other Trump properties by cannibalizing their customers. In the end, the billion dollar casino was sold to the bankruptcy administrator for $890 million, named “Trump Entertainment Resorts”, itself filing for bankruptcy in 2004, 2009, and 2014.

His casino ventures show a reliable pattern of using other people’s money to buy and build, then forcing investors to take a loss while the prepackaged bankruptcies allowed him to keep the assets and the profits. His supporters might say this is common in the casino industry, which isn't true, but he shows this pattern of behavior in the stock market as well. In 1987, at the height of his casino activity, he started a new scam. “He would acquire shares in a company with borrowed money, suggest publicly that he was contemplating buying enough to become a majority owner, then quietly sell on the resulting rise in the stock price…” Media reports at the time claimed his pump and dump gained $55 million; government documents showed his stake was smaller and profits less than $11 million. This one trick pony would work a few times between 1987 and 1989, including in companies such as Gillette, Hilton, and Federated Department stores. By 1989, Wall Street was wise and left him bag holding an American Airlines takeover bid, resulting in a $35 million loss.

More recently WSB’ers will no doubt remember the Dead Sea levels of saltiness caused by accusations of pumping and dumping last year’s trade war with China, and the resulting cycle of market agitations on threats, bad news, counter threats, trade talks, and deals. Finally, Covid-19 has given us hydrochlorique panaceas, and other pump and dumps we’re still learning about.

Tl;dr The president has shown a persistent penchant for profligacy using other people’s money. Most recently to use the federal government to price gouge PPE and to attempt to have his signature on stimulus checks- but he’s been doing it for 40 years. With JayPau, he’s found a real life infinite money hack, and everything I’ve written is to prove to you he isn’t afraid to use it. Keynes said, “the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent” but what we’re seeing today isn’t irrationality, it is the biggest pump and stop stock scam infinite printing we’ve ever seen from a guy who brags about pump and dumps and bankruptcy filings. Your puts wont print, Trump is betting his reelection on it, and the all-in is infinite. Positions- holding all cash.

2.) Early data on OPEC’s April production suggests that it hit 13 month highs in April to 30.25 million bpd. That 30.25 million bpd is a month on month increase of 1.61 million bpd.

3.) The OPEC MOMR showing official April production data will be published on May 13, to which the market will react with falling prices. 

4.) The CME recently raised its margin requirements for forward oil contracts. The June contract now requires margin of $10,000.  Given that each contract is 1,000 barrels of oil, simple math tells us that $10 per barrel is a key level to watch in trading.  Should crude fall under the $10 mark, it could trigger margin calls. That could in turn force more selling to raise cash, which sends prices lower, and the vicious cycle continues.

5.) Settlement for June Oil futures contacts is on May 19th. We all remember what happened the day leading up to this last month when oil went negative.

6.) All of this will lead right into NAT earnings on May 18th... 

7.) You will hear a loud BOOM! That will be the sound of the 🌈🐻 blowing up there accounts.

Bonus: The most recent weekly API crude inventory build was less than expected at 9.978 million barrels vs the 10.619 million expected. This build was a 3.248 Million barrel decrease from the 13.226 Million barrels from the previous week. The market took this as bullish for oil and oil prices rose and tanker stocks sold off. What the market didn’t realize is that this decrease wasn’t due to increased demand and a recovery. This decrease happened because there isn’t any more storage room available. The market has this data point all wrong. You can’t store oil you don’t have room for.

Let me be perfectly clear to you greedy ratfucks hoping to print your $3 puts on the same trick.

The market crash in march was on the back of fear and uncertainty. There was no precedent, no plan for the economy. The market  responded to a deep shock to the established market reality and cratered.

Fear in human psychology has diminishing returns as we adapt to a new situation. We fear what we don't know, but as we grapple with a situation, we learn to adapt, and as we learn, we set in place plans and strategies. For covid, we now have those plans in place. We have a timeline to a vaccine, drugs coming online to reduce severity, a pathway to at least limited economic re-opening. People can see the way forward. We have for the most part accepted the reality of our new situation as the new normal.

The  market in turn is now awake to the crisis, so you're going to see diminishing  returns on the same type of bad news. We expect bad news because it is part of the new normal. We now also have a precedent of resistance points to overcome all the way back down from the rally. It's going to take something  completely unexpected and horrific to get another severe drop. To get people panicking again, it's going to have to come out of left field. Something they haven't already mentally price into, like suddenly revealing your anus on social media.

To get the  same level of collapse, we are going to need to see more news that is  equally as shocking as the original covid outbreak to the existing market. Best case bear scenario is a slow bleed as the reality of the possible \~30% GDP contractions and crushingly low Q2 earnings.

TL:DR - bear scenario - market is going to bleed out, not run off a cliff. Do something unexpected outside of the current expected norm like release anthrax or start a war with china to see further dramatic drops.

*Edit:* 

*Some of you retards seem to think I'm being anti-bear, or I don't think a crash will happen. It's going to happen, but it won't go into full effect until the integrity of the current plan is severely eroded and for uncertainty to begin to tick up again.

* [7 days ago: The Normie Playbook: A Terrifying SPY Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8krsz/the_normie_playbook_a_terrifying_spy_update/)

Last week was rough. I averaged into SPY puts 4/21-4/23 as we rose from 272 up to 283. I expected the channel to break downward. It didn't. I put $4000 into this play. Last Monday I was down over $1700. Last Wednesday saw the current max loss, down $2300. Worse than the money, there was the reality that when I decided to put money into this play, I candidly didn't see a breakout to the positive, and being wrong is not my favorite.

When a play breaks down, the important thing is to reassess. I don't believe in diamond hands, in life the only value in looking back is to learn from the past before turning forward and making the best of what sits in front of you.

Each day is a coin flip. I called it wrong. When we broke channel, I had to re-evaluate. When I set the play in motion, it was primarily due to the channel compounding with critical earnings announcements and the FED meeting. What kept me in the play was the lack of news that changed my macro vibe, and the back of the week Amazon earnings call.

# Still Holding, Still Down

Things went to crap, but we tested 292+, got a giant red candle as we closed 4/29, set a high of 296+ after hours, before crashing into our 4/30 open. The bears are driving this week, but it's unclear to me how much momentum they have.

Earnings calls are still bullish. Q1 wasn't great. Q2 who cares priced in. Q3 ... 'murica! I believe that narrative a total fallacy. Q3 will not turn the way the market hoped, neither will Q4, nor 2021 for that matter. Yet, all that matters for this play is right now. The market is forward looking, and there isn't a ton of bull news to counter all the bear straw being chucked on our friendly camel. But .. I don't know that I believe this downtrend is a capitulation by bulls, I am extremely worried that there's another test in the 285-295 range coming. Time to chew some straw.

# Sell the Dip? Hold for Tendies?

Truth is, I'm not stupid enough to tell you I know where we're headed. We broke a key resistance point in Sunday futures. [SV has terrific volume profiles](https://twitter.com/sep_var/status/1257070583738544134?s=20) and has keyed on 2790 as the number to watch for tomorrow's open. Let's revisit last our prior channel:

[Well hello again](https://preview.redd.it/qwowmbzcpnw41.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=d52924e71474605f88f123d8f0ceaa12747e4315)

The challenge with going up when we think it'll go down is that we create solid supports as we retrace. Each support eats momentum, and I can't make up my mind for the short term on if we a) bounce off 274-277 and test upwards again or b) break the channel's support and test into the 260's.

Given my lack of confidence in short term direction, I've already started looking for hedges and plays that can help me protect myself as I watch for a need to exit. I candidly don't know exactly how I'll play this to it's end. But I can tell you the first action I'll take. To revisit where I have allocated my $4000: 14.62% allocated to 5/29 220p, 45.14% to 6/30 220p, and 40.25% to 9/18 220p.

My 5/29 position is currently down an encouraging 76.76% at market close Friday. I have very little interest in continuing to hold it, theta will burn what little is left to the ground. I want to see where futures land in the morning, then barring the unforeseen, I'll set a stop limit order to dump the position.

For now, I'm not looking to abandon the 6/30 or 9/18 positions. I may take the remaining 5/29 position if it stops out and look to average 6/30 down. With any luck, we drill until reality hits and everything prints.

For now, the coach drew a play he believed in, everyone practiced it, he called it in the game, the defense covered it perfectly, the QB scrambled towards the sideline and everyone went into scramble drill mode. What happens next? Flip a coin. Watch it all unfold, and react with intention.

I'll post updates as time allows and the week progresses.

# Current Position Details

I like to allocate a set amount to a play or position.  It works for me, helps me stay grounded.  That doesn't mean I can't opt to invest more into it, but it's helpful for my tracking.   This play was given $4000, (edit: I allocated another $1000, play now at $5000) here's where it's at:

* Current Cash: $2632
* Realized Losses: $2538

And the now closed positions:

* Closed: 5/29 SPY 220p 2 contracts @ 2.84 avg : Cost $568, Sold for $94 : $474 loss
* Closed: 5/11 SPY 276p 10 contracts @ 1.00 : Cost $1000, Sold for $1170 : $170 profit
* Closed: 9/18 SPY 220p 2 contracts @ 7.82 avg : Cost $1564, Sold for $912 : $652 loss
* Closed: 6/30 SPY 220p 4 contracts @ 4.39 avg : Cost $1756, Sold for $448 : $1308 loss
* Expired Worthless: 5/1 SPY 300c (Amazon Earnings Hedge) : $104 loss

# Updates

5/4 @ 4:30 : I stopped out of my 5/29 220p's.  It's a bummer.  Realized $474 in losses.  We'll see where tonight takes us, but there's a couple things on my mind.  First, is a short term call position worth the hedge this week.  Second, should I push my 6/30's to a further strike.  Third, should I allocate more to average down and up as we rise, very dependent on if I believe this is the last hurrah of a dying rally, I'm not there yet.  Decisions to come, but general sentiment is one that there's still something here worth salvaging.

5/5 @ 6:45 : The .5 FIB retracement has been a battle ground (around 280).  We bounced off it yesterday.  4/9 it was resistance, 4/14 it was broke, but by 4/15 the test failed, broke it again on 4/16 which held to 4/20, from 4/23 to 4/24 there was a frothy battle and the bears capitulated.  This happens to be where I expected to turn down.  We briefly tested breaking the next FIB level, but rejected hard, bouncing all the way down to the .5 FIB again, bouncing off it yesterday.

[Battle for .5](https://preview.redd.it/cbvtqdhhfxw41.png?width=1549&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4448c6b41eff47679e60103dbdc5b614db6631f)

Here's my guess at where we go.  I didn't expect to test upwards, the rejection was nice.  Just like when bulls broke upwards, the first hit was a swift rejection.  We should get a pop back to \~288.  If we break upwards there, well damn, head into short term calls as we re-trace again.  I don't think we will, I think we'll rise into the 287-288 level and then dive under the .5 FIB.  I'm planning to enter into short term puts (5/11 or 5/15) @ 276p when we get there.  I'll likely be allocating an additional $1000 infusion of capital to the play fund the move.

5/5 @ 10:45 : I did enter a short term put position around SPY 288.  Trusting my vibe, hoping the shoulder forms, but it's a battle from 288.3 down to 287.5, have to wait and see where it goes.

5/6 @ 7:30 : Bummer that futures didn't break red (as of yet).  We bottomed early into the evening around 2845 on ES, then entered a tight rising channel:

[Up we go](https://preview.redd.it/y10khbqoq4x41.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4b55b182a74057592ff9862e0e4d7227dbee3bd)

We haven't quite re-tested yesterday's highs, and we've been trying to push out of the channel since around 5AM, but no clarity yet on what today will bring.  Will see where pre-market goes.

5/6 @ 4:00 : I exited my 5/11 position.  Too much risk to hold further, bagging the minor profit and thinking of what could have been.  No change to other positions.

5/7 @ 7:15 : I've got three charts for you today.  The first shows our macro wedge.  We broke it to the downside on 4/30.

[Macro Wedge](https://preview.redd.it/qulug3j1tbx41.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca59daf24d41b604f0f904acc896245ab1e0475e)

This view zooms in on the new wedge forming, with an overlay of the recent channel.  You can see the AH breakout attempt as the channel constricts.

[Breakout attempt to downside](https://preview.redd.it/vp6flcj1tbx41.png?width=1819&format=png&auto=webp&s=9be9b6dedd6e0a56b3995045df7d7c620fe2818e)

And then finally a better view of the current channel and wedge.

[Today's breakout during AH](https://preview.redd.it/zdrn6ej1tbx41.png?width=1818&format=png&auto=webp&s=209b73ef256849445700afbf98e8731638139b0f)

We've been breaking downward, hedging up in AH as people cover, and then resetting price in the day's session.  I don't have a clear sense where we're going, but I see two options.  1) At open we climb and push past 289.5, resetting the upper bound of our wedge and trying to push up the macro wedge above 300.  2) The breakout holds, and we set a new low on the current wedge pushing under 282.

My money and gut both say we sell out at open, head back into our wedge.  That wedge is really just forming, so there's not a lot of strength keeping price in, I think it will push outward today to find it's true edges.  If it pushes down, I won't be taking any action other than watching.  If it pushes up, depending on where the action goes, I may pull my 6/30 220p's and move them into short term calls.  A failure in this breakout is not good news for bears.  Today will be fun.

5/7 @ 12:00 I'm capitulating for the moment.  We're pushing the top of the daily range, pushing channel highs, and there's only losses above 289.5.  I don't know if it's going to hold, if it doesn't it could backslide, but my gut says short term it's going to break, and I can find a better re-entry to average down.  I dropped my 4 6/30's and 2 9/18's.  Down, but not out.",2020-05-04 06:10:03,-0.9999,0.0,-0.4409090395480226,-0.4802696798493409

tl:dr: UBER and LYFT are fucked this week. Market will definitely crash *again*. I think UBER is shitter than LYFT because UBER increases how much it loses with EATS as it *gains* *more* users. Lyft at least has been losing less over the past few quarters. I'm short UBER and may also buy Lyft puts. If Lyft becomes cheap, like \~$5B market cap, I'll probably go long and hard.

Disclaimer: This isn't invesment advice and always do your own DD and come to your own conclusions. Don't just trust a Brando drinking retard sitting and typing bigly words on a sweet, sweet lit-up keyboard that was clearly ingrained in him the difference versus a need and a want.

Some folks may be interested  and already looking at the two major ridesharing companies: UBER &  LYFT.  I've generally favored LYFT over UBER because it isn't trying to  do (and fail) at more than rideshare (the primary biz function); yes,  both lose money and are in hyper-growth mode but being *better* at losing money in *more*  ways doesn't bode well, especially when it detracts from the  aforementioned core biz.  UBER is definitely succeeding in losing money  in ever more (not so) creative ways.

As earnings approach for these rideshare innovators, below is some  info for readers to peruse as their crayon-eating time frees up. As  always, do your DD and make us proud.  Else, you're relegated to  drinking piss in your mom's basement. I get that might be appealing to  some, but whatever, some of you get it.

1. *Net Loss* increased from -42.3 to -72%. For 2019, 174.7% of their revenue is *Total Costs and Expenses.* Lyft only does rideshare and their R&D increase a bit closer to 3x versus Uber's \~2.5x. Notably, *Sales and Marketing* went **down** (37.3 to 22.5%). (pg. 64)
2. *Cost of Revenue* \- 75% increase to $7.2B (51% of revenue). (pg. 65)
3. *Operations and Support* \- 88% increase to $646M (17.6% of revenue). (pg. 66)
4. *Sales and Marketing* \- 1% increase to $814M (22.5% of revenue).
5. *R&D* \- 400% increase to $1.5B (41.6% of revenue).
6. Revenue in crease of \~68%. (pg. 65)

Lyft had a huge loss of $48.53/share for quarter end in March 2019;  though EPS has seems to have stabilized and loss/share decreasing each  quarter with Dec 2019 having a -$1.19 EPS.  It appears that this was  mostly due to R&D increasing 6x and G&A \~3x from prior quarter  (pgs. 70-71). The percentage breakdown is more clear on pg. 70, as aside from R&D and G&A in March 2019, the Net Loss seems to be going in the  right direction.

The *Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows* seems to show that Lyft is burning through *less* cash each year, as reported on the *Net cash used in operating activities* line item. (pg. 82)

[UBER](https://investor.uber.com/financials/default.aspx) | [Insider Trades](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=UBER&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1) | [Latest 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/f272e038-1c89-456c-acf8-cea0cffe544d.pdf)

1. *Net Income* of 9% and *Loss* of 60% for 2018 to 2019. For 2019, 161% of their revenue is *Total Costs and Expenses*. Even though their top lines are increasing for rideshare or Eats, 14 and 72%, respectively, for 2018 to 2019, their *Loss from operations* more than doubled from -27% to -61%.  This led to a . (pg. 56)
2. *Cost of Revenue* \- 28% increase to $2.18B (60.2% of revenue). (pg. 57)
3. *Operations and Support* \- 52% increase to $2.3B (16% of revenue).
4. *Sales and Marketing* \- 47% increase to $4.6B (33% of revenue).
5. *R&D* \- whopping 221% increase to $4.8B (34% of revenue). (pg. 58)
6. Revenue in crease of \~25.5%. (calculated from pg. 55)
7. *Cash and Cash Equivalents* \- $10.9B as of year end 2019. (pg 78)
8. *Long-term Debt* \- $5.7B for year end 2019 (down from $6.9B  in 2018). Next two are Convertible Notes maturing in 2021 and 2022; next  3 are Senior Notes for years '23, '26 & '27. (pg. 112)

Eats and Freight are growing revenue far more than rideshare with 82  and 105%, respectively (pg. 61).  Then looking at the next page, it  shows segment adjusted EBITDA.  It seems rideshare is doing OK,  generating an adjusted profit which *increased* 34% from 2018.  However, Eats was a *loss*  and for year ends 2018 and 2019 losses increase 69 and 128%,  respectively.  This is what I've been worried about with Uber; this  diversified segment is more of a hindrance than an advantage over Lyft.   This is even thought the gross bookings are seeing 164 and 83%  increases for year ends 2018 and 2019, respectively. They're losing *more* money as they gain more market share in each of these non-rideshare segments.

The *Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows* seems to show that Uber is burning through *more* cash each year, as reported on the *Net cash used in operating activities* line item. (pg. 84)

It'll be interesting to see what quarter-end March '20 will look like  when they report.  For same Q ends in 2018 and 2019 we had a $2.00 and  -$2.23 basic EPS, respectively. (pg. 87)

**Conclusion**

This is just the start of some more DD that I'll cap off tomorrow.   However, I'm sticking with the thesis that Uber is still struggling with  Eats (and its other bets) for the foreseeable future. In my mind, this  is a hugh negative. If I wanted to invest in ridesharing, I'd be long  Lyft and short Uber.

**Inspiration**

Most people who know me personally know that I spend an unhealthy amount of my free time in finance and trading as a hobby, even competing in paper options trading competitions when I was in high school. A few weeks ago, I had a friend ask if he could call me because he just installed Robinhood and wanted to buy SPY puts after seeing everyone on r/wallstreetbets post gains posts from all the tendies they’ve made from their SPY puts. The problem was, he actually didn’t understand how options worked at all, and needed a thorough explanation about how options are priced, what strike prices and expiration dates mean, and what the right strategy to buying options are. That’s how I knew we were at the euphoria stage of buying SPY puts - it’s when dumb money starts to pour in, and people start buying securities because they see everyone else making money and they want in, even if they have no idea what they’re buying, and price becomes dislocated from fundementals. Sure enough, less than a week later, we started the bull rally that we are currently in. Bubbles are formed when people buy something not because of logic or even gut feeling, but when people who previously weren’t involved see their dumb neighbors make tons of money from it, and they don’t want to miss out.

A few days ago, I started getting questions from other friends about what stocks they should buy and if I thought something was a good investment. That inspired me to dig a bit deeper to see how many other people are thinking the same thing.

**Data**

Ever since March, we’ve seen an unprecedented amount of money pour into the stock market from retail investors.

**Analysis**

What we can see from Reddit numbers, Google Trends, and CNBC stats is that in between the first week of March and first week of April, we see a massive inflow of retail interest in the stock market. Not only that, but this inflow of interest is coming from all age cohorts, from internet-using Zoomers to TV-watching Boomers. Robinhood SPY holdings and earnings reports from E\*Trade, TD Ameritrade, and Schwab have also all confirmed record numbers of new clients, number of trades, and assets. There’s something interesting going on if you look closer at the numbers. The numbers growth in brokers for designed for “less sophisticated” investors (i.e. Robinhood and E\*Trade) are much larger than for real brokers (i.e. Schwab and Ameritrade). This implies that the record number of new users and trade volume is coming from dumb money. The numbers shown here only really apply to the US and Canada, but [there’s also data](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200501001500320&sa=D&ust=1588551355924000) to suggest that there’s also record numbers of foreign investors pouring money into the US stock market as well.

However, after the third week of March, we see the interest start to slowly decline and plateau, indicating that we probably have seen most of those new investors who wanted to have a long position in the market do so.

[SPX daily](https://preview.redd.it/osfyqpsxanw41.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a33eb891f68ae9558b0deea59b5283a50e2392c)

**Rationale**

Pretty much everything past this point is purely speculation, and isn’t really backed up by any solid data so take whatever I say here with a cup of salt. We could see from the graph that new investor interest started with the first bull trap we saw in the initial decline from early March, and peaking right after the end of the crash in March. So it would be fair to guess that we’re seeing a record amount of interest in the stock market from a “buy the dip” mentality, especially from Robinhood-using Millennials. Here’s a few points on my rationalization of this behavior, based on very weak anecdotal evidence

* They missed out of their chance of getting in the stock market at the start of the bull market that happened at the end of 2009
* They’ve all seen the stock market make record gains throughout their adult lives, but believing that the market might be overheated, they were waiting for a crash
* Most of them have gotten towards the stage of their lives where they actually have some savings and can finally put some money aside for investments
* This stock market crash seems like their once-in-a-decade opportunity that they’ve been waiting for, so everyone jumped in
* Everyone’s stuck at their homes with vast amounts of unexpected free time on their hands

Most of these new investors got their first taste in the market near the bottom, and probably made some nice returns. Of course, since they didn’t know what they were doing, they probably put a very small amount of money at first, but after seeing a 10% return over one week, validating that maybe they do know something, they decide to slowly pour in more and more of their life savings. That’s what’s been fueling this bull market.

**Sentiment & Magic Crayons**

[As I mentioned previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyvnxt/what_happened_and_why_markets_seem_irrational/), this bull rally will keep going until enough bears convert to bulls. Markets go up when the amount of new bullish positions outnumber the amount of new bearish positions, and vice versa. Record amounts of new investors, who previously never held a position in the market before, fueled the bullish side of this equation, despite all the negative data that has come out and dislocating the price from fundamentals. All the smart money that was shorting the markets saw this happening, and flipped to become bulls because you don’t fight the trend, even if the trend doesn’t reflect reality.

From the data shown above, we can see new investor interest growth has started declining since mid March and started stagnating in early April. The declining volume in SPY since mid-March confirms this. That means, once the sentiment of the new retail investors starts to turn bearish, and everyone figures out how much the stocks they’re holding are really worth, another sell-off will begin. I’ve seen something very similar to this a few years ago with Bitcoin. Near the end of 2017, Bitcoin started to become mainstream and saw a flood of retail investors suddenly signing up for Coinbase (i.e. Robinhood) accounts and buying Bitcoin without actually understanding what it is and how it works. Suddenly everyone, from co-workers to grandparents, starts talking about Bitcoin and might have thrown a few thousand dollars into it. This appears to be a very similar parallel to what’s going on right now. Of course there’s differences here in that equities have an intrinsic value, although many of them have gone way above what they should be intrinsically worth, and the vast majority of retail investors don’t understand how to value companies. Then, during December, when people started thinking that the market was getting a bit overheated, some started taking their profits, and that’s when the prices crashed violently. This flip in sentiment now look like it has started with equities.

[SPY daily](https://preview.redd.it/bqum76v3bnw41.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=6298a6e803153392d7f4933575d5d94568543940)

Technical Analysis, or magic crayons, is a discipline in finance that uses statistical analysis to predict market trends based on market sentiment. Of course, a lot of this is hand-wavy and is very subjective; two people doing TA on the same price history can end up getting opposite results, so TA should always be taken with a grain of salt and ideally be backed with underlying justification and not be blindly followed. In fact, I’ve since corrected the ascending wedge I had on SPY since my last post since this new wedge is a better fit for the new trading data.

There’s a few things going on in this chart. The entire bull rally we’ve had since the lows can be modelled using a rising wedge. This is a pattern where there is a convergence of a rising support and resistance trendline, along with falling volume. This indicates a slow decline in net bullish sentiment with investors, with smaller and smaller upside after each bounce off the support until it hits a resistance. The smaller the bounces, the less bullish investors are. When the bearish sentiment takes over across investors, the price breaks below this wedge - a breakdown, and indicates a start of another downtrend.

This happened when the wedge hit resistance at around 293, which is around the same price as the 200 day moving average, the 62% retracement (considered to be the upper bound of a bull trap), and a price level that acted as a support and resistance throughout 2019. The fact that it gapped down to break this wedge is also a strong signal, indicating a sudden swing in investor sentiment overnight. The volume of the break down also broke the downwards trend of volume we’ve had since the beginning of the bull rally, indicating a sudden surge of people selling their shares. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we will go straight from here, and I personally think that we will see the completion of a heads-and-shoulders pattern complete before SPY goes below 274, which in itself is a strong support level. In other words, SPY might go from 282 -> 274 -> 284 -> 274 before breaking the 274 support level.

[VIX Daily](https://preview.redd.it/4370jo35bnw41.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=f846c1300307737498398dbafcb8d90eb2cd66b1)

Doing TA is already sketchy, and doing TA on something like VIX is even more sketchy, but I found this interesting so I’ll mention it. Since the start of the bull rally, we’ve had VIX inside a descending channel. With the breakdown we had in SPY yesterday, VIX has also gapped up to have a breakout from this channel, indicating that we may see future volatility in the next week or so.

**Putting Everything Together**

Finally, we get to my thesis. This entire bull rally has been fueled by new retail investors buying the dip, bringing the stock price to euphoric levels. Over the past few weeks, we’ve been seeing the people waiting at the sidelines for years to get into the stock market slowly FOMO into the rally in smaller and smaller volumes, while the smart money have been locking in their profits at an even slower rate - hence an ascending wedge. As the amount of new retail interest in the stock market started slowed down, the amount of new bulls started to decline. It looks like Friday might have been the start of the bearish sentiment taking over, meaning it’s likely that 293 was the top, unless any significant bullish events happen in the next two weeks like a fourth round of stimulus, in which case we might see 300. This doesn’t mean we’ll instantly go back to circuit breakers on Monday, and we might see 282 -> 274 -> 284 -> 274 happen before panic, this time by the first-time investors, eventually bringing us down [towards SPY 180](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/).

tldr; we've reached the top

**EDIT - I'll keep a my live thoughts here as we move throughout this week in case anyone's still reading this and interested.**

5/4 8PM - /ES was red last night but steadily climbed, which was expected since 1h RSI was borderline oversold, leaving us to a slightly green day. /ES looks like it has momentum going up, but is approaching towards overbought territory now. Expecting it to go towards 284 (possibly where we'll open tomorrow) and bouncing back down from that price level

5/5 Market Open - Well there goes my price target. I guess at this point it might go up to 293 again, but will need a lot of momentum to push back there to 300. Seems like this is being driven by oil prices skyrocketing.

5/5 3:50PM - Volume for the upwards price action had very little volume behind it. Seeing a selloff EOD today, could go either way although I have a bearish bias. Going to hold cash until it goes towards one end of the 274-293 channel (see [last week's thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9h9np/an_indepth_look_into_the_next_few_weeks/)). Still believe that we will see it drop below 274 next week, but we might be moving sideways in the channel this week and a bit of next week before that happens. Plan for tomorrow is buy short dated puts if open < 285. Otherwise, wait till it goes to 293 before buying those puts

5/5 6PM - What we saw today could be a false breakout above 284. Need tomorrow to open below 285 for that to be confirmed. If so, my original thesis of it going back down to 274 before bouncing back up will still be in play.

5/6 EOD - Wasn't a false breakout. Looks like it's still forming the head-and-shoulders pattern mentioned before, but 288 instead of 284 as the level. Still not sure yet so I'm personally going to be holding cash and waiting this out for the next few days. Will enter into short positions if we either go near 293 again or drop below 270. Might look into VIX calls if VIX goes down near 30.

5/7 Market Open - Still waiting. If we break 289 we're probably heading to 293. I'll make my entry to short positions when we hit that a second time. There's very little bullish momentum left (see MACD 1D), so if we hit 293 and then drop back down, we'll have a MACD crossover event which many traders and algos use as a sell signal. Oil is doing some weird shit.

5/7 Noon - Looks like we're headed to 293. Picked up VIX 32.5c 5/27 since VIX is near 30.

5/7 11PM - /ES is hovering right above 2910, with 4h and 1h charts are bullish from MACD and 1h is almost overbought in RSI. Unless something dramatic happens we'll probably hit near 293 tomorrow, which is where I'll get some SPY puts. We might drop down before ever touching it, or go all the way to 295 (like last time) during the day, but expecting it to close at or below 293. After that I'm expecting a gap down Monday as we start the final leg down next week towards 274. Expecting 1D MACD to crossover in the final leg down, which will be a signal for bears to take over and institutions / day traders will start selling again

5/8 Market Open - Plan is to wait till a good entry today, either when technicals looks good or we hit 293, and then buy some SPY June 285p and July 275p

5/8 Noon - Everything still going according to plan. Most likely going to slowly inch towards 293 by EOD. Will probably pick up SPY puts and more VIX calls at power hour (3 - 4PM). Monday will probably gap down, although there's a small chance of one more green / sideways day before that happens if we have bullish catalysts on the weekend.

5/8 3:55PM - SPY at 292.60. This is probably going to be the closest we get to 293. Bought SPY 290-260 6/19 debit spreads and 292-272 5/15 debit spreads, as well as doubling down on VIX calls from yesterday, decreasing my cost basis. Still looks like there's room for one more green day on Monday, so I left some money on the side to double down if that's the case, although it's more likely than not we won't get there.

5/8 EOD - Looks like we barely touched 293 exactly AH before rebounding down. Too bad you can't buy options AH, but more convinced we'll see a gap down on Monday. Going to work on another post over the weekend and do my updates there. Have a great weekend everyone!",2020-05-04 04:49:19,-0.9993,-0.4019,0.09249715447154469,-0.4362342818428184

Weird shit in this thread. WEird shit with this stock for months. I'm buying more calls.

Getting told I'm trying to screw you guys with buying my calls? But I own 25 dollar calls, not the 20 dollar or 17.5 I recommend as its cheaper since I bought too early.. and I also own July 25 calls.. why the fuck would I suggest october if I'm trying to screw you guys when I own july? Wouldnt I pump up july as October would react to positive volume moves in July? like wtf...

Then I'm being told drowning will offset these funerals.. when 1-14 year old kids die mostly in the USA from drowning and NOT 65+ OLD PEOPLE.... (if 1000 65+ people die from covid and 85% of all drowning comes from children, it is NOT gonna effect the offset!! Have you MORONS not looked at the FLORIDA BEACHES you all talk about? you fuckin morons not going into the water just coughing on each other as you walk on the beach?You fucking idiots don't let your kids play in your own pool with covid out there? Road accidents? Really? When multiple states have lines of cars for food banks, protesting, and other purchases? ISN'T LIKE HALF YOUR STATES RE-OPENING???

You fucking think all these retards out there are going to not do funerals? or do cremation? Or buy burial plots?

YOu think people are going to have their funerals in their homes? like LITERALLY put the body and coffin in their living room? if they can't go to to funeral en-mass they'll have the body/cremation at the funeral home, do their eulogy with maybe priest at the funeral home and web conference everything else to those wanting to ""attend""... Last time I went to a funeral it didnt cost more money if 30 people instead of 5 showed up.. And I doubt CSV stock would drop cause their fucking food platters aren't being eaten or flowers aren't purchased... But what do I know.

When people realize how much money is going to DEATH because they CAN'T SEE THEIR OWN LOVED ONES WHEN THEY DIE IN HOSPITAL so they then make sure they can say goodbye... maybe by a hrmmm FUNERAL they will realize that in a sea of red shit stocks death is still profitable... in 1918 Funeral homes had to HIRE and were one of the principle employers during that period.. this ain't no fuckin Spanish Flu, but I'm pretty god damn sure you have 70\~k dead right now, and 2k\~ dying everyday, and most your stupid ass country is re-opening. Fuckin great job.

Saying they won't gather in groups yet thousands of posts and comments about no one following the rules where it'll hit them the most...

Also... Ever think that if the death toll gets too high for the GOP/Trump wagon, he'll pull a rabbit out of the hat and maybe pay for funerals? Just a thought.

# OVERALL TL;DR

Tankers not only begin earnings this week but said earnings will be the best they have been in at least 5 years, if not the last decade, due to all-time-high tanker rates that began spiking in mid-March. Rates are so high that, say, companies with clean LR2 tankers currently run a spot price of 8x the 5 year historical average and a single 2 month spot voyage is enough to be profitable on the entire year. Make bets on tanker companies that are trading below their NAV, will post strong FCF, were well positioned for the spike in prices, have large fleets, and have the right types of ships. $NAT is a risky stock because it's actually the among the worst across every single one of these dimensions of any tanker company.

**WHY NAT IS A MEME:**

Let me draw you an analogy:

WSB is a class in school, and you've all decided not to be homosexual for a day. NAT is a girl in the class.  Now that you're not homos, you all start sending NAT dick pics and showering her with attention, assuming that she is extremely high value. However, in your autistic haste, you all forgot to look around and fail to realize that there are 15 other girls in the classroom; moreover, they are all way hotter than NAT.  NAT is now overvalued and many of you are too attached to admit you had no idea what the fuck you were doing and are  - now.

**POSITIONS:**

I like EURN and STNG, but there are many other viable tanker plays you could look at.  Check out TNK. DSSI, DHT, FRO etc; DYOR.

**Low Risk Position Examples**

* EuroNav ($EURN) $12.50C 6/15
* Scorpio Tankers ($STNG) $23C 6/15

**Moderate Risk Positions**

* $EURN $12.50C 5/15
* $STNG $25C 5/15

**Higher Risk Positions**

* $EURN $15C 5/15
* $STNG $30C 5/15

**Legendary Autistic Risk Positions**

* $EURN $17.50C 5/15
* $STNG $35C 5/15
* $NAT, any calls

# SECTION 1: Overview on Oil Demand Crisis

If you understand oil demand destruction and contango, skip ahead to section 2. However, based on the fact that people continue to pile in on USO and UCO calls and leaps under the justification of ""hurr durr oil must go up, it's so cheap"", and half of you are still bagholding $NAT, I assume 75%+ of you are retarded.

Many of you still probably have no idea what's happening with oil and why it's fucked long-term. The tl;dr here is that even with OPEC+'s historical cuts, we're still drastically oversupplied. The problem with oil is it's not your meme SPY calls that are in the cloud; oil is a physical product and when you trade USO, you're trading (theoretically) on receiving delivery of oil. We are almost completely out of oil storage already.

You may ask, well [u/safuros](https://www.reddit.com/u/safuros/), if that's true, why don't we turn off the wells? Markets naturally handle supply and demand.  Oil production isn't that simple. The reason every country is sandbagging and trying to get other countries to cut oil is that there's a game theory element in play, as well as an oil well intrinsic function issue.

Once conventional oil wells reduce their production to roughly 50-60% of output, they *cannot go any lower* without risking damaging the wells, which are extraordinarily expensive to get the rights to drill on/lease and is like risking a gallon of water when you've only taken a sip. Thus, the only option to reduce further is to entirely stop production and cap the well, and then, assuming your lease on the well hasn't lapsed by the time you can re-open it, uncap it, both of which are extraordinarily expensive options that are also time-consuming.

Therefore, many oil companies would rather just sell at a crappy rate, because that's still a long-term better play than turning off; you're paying for the well either way. Game-theory wise, why the fuck should you be the well to turn off, if other's aren't? Add in the fact that everyone cheats on oil production cuts and the Saudis and Russians are trying to fuck each other as well as US shale, and you've got a nice oil crisis.  Per comments, note that US oil production is easier to spin up and down than overseas oil, but that doesn't really matter because we can't stop everyone else from producing and we aren't going to bear the entire burden ourselves.

This leads to the USO/UCO shit show and negative WTI price. Normally, futures holders offload their contracts to buyers who intend to actually take physical delivery as the option expiration date draws near. However, because there is no storage and no demand, none of the typical buyers actually wanted to buy, so you had a bunch of tendie seeking autists desperately trying to offload their contracts so that they wouldn't have 5 dumptrucks of oil barrels delivered to their homes and be completely fucked, such that they were willing to *pay* people (i.e. negative price) to take their contracts. As for contango, well, google it.

Finally, this problem isn't going away any time soon because unless you're so truly deluded as to believe that we'll not only have a V shaped re-opening in terms of social, commercial, and consumer behavior, but that fuel consumption across airlines and cars will rebound immediately, we're on a long term path to demand recovery. This is like having a clogged bathtub full of water and turning the faucet from 100% on to 50% on - you're still fucked until the faucet turns off (impossible) or the clog goes away more than enough to offset the faucet (not happening for a while). This is why experts broadly agree that [the OPEC+ cuts are meaningless](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/21/opecplus-mega-deal-rendered-meaningless-by-demand-destruction) and that groups like Morgan Stanley believe [demand destruction of oil will persist until well into 2021](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Morgan-Stanley-Oil-Demand-Wont-Return-To-Normal-Until-End-2021.html).

# SECTION 2: A brief overview of Tankers

You don't need much of a brain to understand, given the above, that tankers stand to benefit from demand destruction. However, there are many types of tankers, and it's not as obvious as hurr durr buy tankers. Each tanker type carries a different type of product, has a different size, and commands a different rate. Here is the current rates:

[3 key types of tanker business models, spread across a variety of tanker variants](https://preview.redd.it/hd3q2ncaqmw41.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=fca616d8afc83afa14721af8e2e5bd1bf243fadd)

At this point I'm realizing that this post is getting way too long and i'm tired of typing it already, but do your own research on types of tankers. You can see though that tankers are commanding a stupidly high rate compared to their historical values:

https://preview.redd.it/q8u5q1odqmw41.jpg?width=1081&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bc3668993ed1965a45f8c9af5a7a07f16e851b5

The current rates are so high that [one spot voyage is profitable on the entire year](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/tankers/tanker-rates-one-spot-voyage-makes-the-whole-year-in-red-hot-market/2-1-801368).

>""If an MR can get $30,000 per day on a spot voyage, it covers its costs for a year...If an LR2 gets $150,000 or $160,000 a day, it’s the same...you could lay the ship up, earn zero for the next ten months, and still make a profit on the ship.""

[Guess who owns the most clean-fuel ready LR2's that are exposed to the spot price? $STNG](https://preview.redd.it/iyeeu45gqmw41.jpg?width=894&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b23175ca9c77eb406cadc5b01411c22545e72d59)

Now, don't be stupid and assume that rates will hold this high all year. That said, even if rates went to $0 by mid summer, the rates for Q2 are so high such that it'd still be a higher revenue year than last year. And rates aren't going to $0...they're going to continue to stay above the historical average, just not as high as now, due to the crazy demand destruction.

* **Miscellaneous point of clarification:** I see a lot of dumbasses posting about what numbers will look like if the entire fleet is booked out for and extrapolating to the entire year (usually in reference to $NAT).  That's ridiculous and not how it works, so don't just assume number of tankers \* spot rate \* 365 = revenue for year = tendies.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SECTION 3: Why $STNG and $EURN?

I really need to go fuck your wife soon, so I'm making the sections shorter and shorter; however, Ii'll still tell you way $STNG and $EURN are good bets. First, let's start with NAV - Net Asset Value. If you don't know what this means, Google it.

*(edit) Disclaimer* \- As I mentioned at the top of the post, there are plenty of other viable tanker options.  $STNG and $EURN are my plays so that's why this is focused on them.

As you (should) know, NAV is something you estimate and can be calculated differently based on different assumptions. Trading below NAV means the stock is underpriced as is, and that's before record earnings and guidance. By most accounts, $EURNs NAV is at least $13 currently, and $STNG is close to $30. They trade at $10 and $21, respectively, right now.

&#x200B;

[$STNG isn't even at its average price for 2019, but 2020 is objectively a better year unless a meteor blows up their fleet](https://preview.redd.it/smsydzfnqmw41.jpg?width=2001&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b4de32295c00a853844ad5de51c44e7aeabbe0c)

Secondly, fleet size and type. $STNG has one of the largest fleets in the world, and in particular, they have the most LR2 tankers. If you go back up to the graph, you'll see that clean LR2 tankers are commanding an absurd rate, spiking to as high as $250,000 for a few days and currently settled around $150-175k/day, compared to a 5-year historical value of below $25k. $EURN has a solid fleet of VLCC's which are commanding a strong rate, and EURN has good financials - most their boats are fairly new, they don't have a ton of debt.

Lastly, they're among the first up on the earnings block, with STNG reporting 5/6 this week and EURN reporting on 5/7. Compare that to NAT, who reports the 23rd, so theta will eat away at what remains of your atrophied testicles every day. That said, regardless of theta, STNG and EURN are really strongly positioned.

I expect that earnings will be solid and likely beat, but not by a crazy amount because rates only started really jacking up in late March, and rates in early Q1 were actually pretty low. However, as many of you still don't fucking understand, **earnings don't matter nearly as much as** **guidance.** That's why you dumbfucks all complain about companies beating earnings but still tanking and then creating stupid conspiracy theories about ""MM is fucking rigging this market"".  The good news here is that earnings should be solid, while guidance for is going to be **euphoric**.

# SECTION 4: Why is $NAT a meme, and mistakes I see people making

Ultimately, this comes down to people angling towards the right space (tankers) but you've been too stupid to do any research. You probably do this for all your bets, because you're a fucking autist, but you should stop.

[b-bUT cRamEr SaId NAT hAs THe BiGGeSt fLe3t iN tHe WoRLd!!!](https://preview.redd.it/7099ndbfurw41.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7dd02c5bb2a8377142f1788547888ad8ccd0ec8)

1. **Fleet size misconception:** Cramer meme'd NAT, infamously calling out that they have the largest fleet in the world. In fact, if you actually tried to verify anything you ever fucking did, you could have googled this and realized that NAT has a fleet that, just like your dick, is one of the smallest around. Moreover, they have the wrong type of boats - they primarily have Suezmax boats, which command an okay rate, but aren't close to the best boats to have right now.
2. **No investigation of NAV**: NAT's NAV, by all accounts, is close to $3. They are trading at close to $6, and were nearing $8-9 at peak pump. Why the fuck on god's green earth would you buy a company with the wrong type of boats, the wrong fleet size, trading at over 2x NAV, when everyone else is around or below their NAV and has a better fleet?
3. **Massive debt and shitty assets:** NAT is saddled in debt, is historically shittily managed (read their earnings report if you know how, but you probably don't know how), and all their boats are at the end of their lifetime, meaning NAT not only has horrible debt but will need to buy a shit ton of new boats very soon
4. **Stupid assumptions on revenue**: We covered this earlier, but no, just because demand is high, it doesn't mean every boat is going to get booked at the spot price. Many boats are on existing contracted rates from last quarter, and the ones who are not are not all getting booked out at once.
5. **Looking at ATH as an indicator**: If i see another one of you dumb fucks pointing out that NAT used to trade at $16 a share 5 years ago, I will personally find you, tape you to a chair, and shit down your mouth. NAT has issued a shit ton more shares. You are probably the same group who thinks that USO rose from $2 to $18 last week.

The ONLY justification for NAT is now that it's been memed and retail knows all about it, it will probably rise again if the other tankers do well. You can make that play, and you might even make money. Just make sure to dump that shit before earnings because they're not going to be good enough to justify the rise and there's going to be a stupid dump.

1890,DD,Intermediate Outlook on the Natural Gas (NG) Market,35,gczz67,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gczz67/intermediate_outlook_on_the_natural_gas_ng_market/,34,1588575043.0,"So the futures market just opened up minutes ago, and [Natural Gas futures opened up over 3%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/ngm20). I think this commodity market is looking very bullish the next few months heading into the summer, and I will explain why. Natural Gas futures are mostly energy complex supply/demand affected, meaning that if you pay attention to the news in the market for the commodity as well as the analysts that make predictions, you can anticipate price movements with some level of predictability (not fool proof). Last week, the EIA released its usual Thursday [Natural Gas Storage report](http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html), showing a build of 70 billion cubic feet (bcf). This was bearish sentiment, which resulted in NG futures prices declining as a result (just to give an idea how the markets react to news). The build was above expected, indicating that producers have not shut in the supply increases as much as anticipated, following months long of demand destruction on the LNG (liquid natural gas) markets.

However, this last Friday, a report from the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-natural-gas-prices-are-a-hot-bet-11588339279) indicated for the first time in about a year, a bullish indicator for the NG futures market. Speculative positions for the commodity were net long (buy-side; bullish) for NG, meaning that the majority of open interest in the NG market was anticipating increases in NG prices. This has been largely driven by the increased expectations for additional/larger shut-ins by NG producers, which will tighten supply for the commodity and drive up prices. Of course, many may be asking ""but since energy market demand is so low (i.e. negative oil prices); won't NG continue to suffer from the demand destruction it has been experiencing?"" While it is true that natural gas demand is very low, it has historically been more stable than WTI demand, and it is already very close to it's 25 year low of $1.552/mmbtu (selling pressure has decreased the last two months significantly). It is likely that supply-side indicators (i.e. shut-ins by producers) will have a greater impact on NG prices in the intermediate to long-term. Shares of Range Resources, EQT, and CNX have all almost doubled since February.

So while the short-term price outlook for [Natural Gas looks grim](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121859-natural-gas-forwards-highlight-continued-battle-between-supplydemand), if you have some patience, the market presents a unique opportunity to capture so price appreciation due to supply chain indicators in the NG market. If you are involved in the futures market, it is hard to anticipate price action on NG for the next couple weeks (it has been very volatile as of late); but taking a long position with a 3-6 month outlook may turn out to be very lucrative. Of course if you are not trading futures, individual nat. gas producers like the ones mentioned above are always an options (although the results of shut ins may already be priced into these), and there is the ETF UNG which is similar to USO in that it holds 80% of its funds in the front month Natural Gas futures contract (an indirect way to invest in the nat. gas futures market).

*Disclaimer: I am not long or short any position in the Natural Gas market currently, however I am actively examining the market for the commodity for an entry point.*

The combination of this dominance and the insulated nature of their business models have led to a lot of frustration for anyone running TA on the SPX during the recent rally.  With the risk of earnings behind us on big tech, lets take a look at how these bad boys are looking and what the implications are for the broader market.

&#x200B;

[AMZN Daily](https://preview.redd.it/l59fkfoj7mw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fefb7961f5afa7b1a314e8c8e4427b7b232fc49)

There was a ton of speculation on AMZN going into earnings, but it is time for this baby to check back to the 2,000 - 2,200 range.  This would be a healthy pull back after the breakout to new highs, but would put a dent in the SPX performance.  MACD crossed over on Friday.

&#x200B;

[MSFT Daily](https://preview.redd.it/dfztu9s99mw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=65341521aa5cf30f6b296b5b8a6c14b95da2fc0e)

MSFT broke its uptrend a couple weeks ago, but hung on as it has an insulated business model and (IMO) if you are an index fund you couldn't afford to miss a breakout on earnings due to the contribution.  With earnings out and MACD waning after the double top at 180, I'm betting on a move back down to the 50 day MA.  Again, a pretty standard check back, but the 7% move down will weigh on the index thanks to the 5.7% weight in the SPY.

&#x200B;

[AAPL Daily](https://preview.redd.it/1eqk7rqyamw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaa9be1af319c90f4db71eb299f92340746721ad)

AAPL, similar to MSFT, broke the uptrend a couple weeks ago, but was bid up into earnings.  With that behind us there is room for a healthy correction back to the 50 day MA at \~270.  That is a 6.5% move down with an over 5% weight in the SPY.

&#x200B;

[SPX Daily](https://preview.redd.it/q759igkjdmw41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e70f5bef509a47100dd297c730bebbb35f7568b)

To tie things together, the rolling over of big tech could drive the S&P down to the 50 day MA of \~2,740.  If momentum to the downside picks up, we could see \~2,640.  

**TL/DR:**  Market sentiment has been influenced by big tech, so look for big tech to signal the next leg down.  With earnings out, technicals are turning negative, which removes the positive influence on broader market.  Tech is likely to outperform throughout this recession, but this increases the probability for downside moves on the names that are truly getting bent over.

Just have some honey and you can probably fix the virus that’s spreading. On top of that the new Asian murder bees are killing all the honey bees so only the big honey farms are going to be producing. 

So the increased demand from allergies and decreased supply from the Asian murderer bees will make the price skyrocket and anyone in before the market realizes will be so happy.

Use options as a form of cheap insurance for your job.

First, I'll point you to [an excellent WSB thread on hedging for options trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5f4p/hedging_for_autists/). You don't need to read it to understand my point, but I want you to take away these key points.

&#x200B;

>Options accomplish 2 primary things:  
>  
>*They allow us to control for downside risk, similar to buying car insurance* for your speed demon of a wife. When you buy puts you are protecting yourself from losses if your long position goes tits up.

>They allow us to leverage our existing assets for greater returns. Similar to renting out your condo to buy more rental condos, you can ""rent out"" stocks that you own by selling covered calls or puts, a concept we will discuss further down. This is where Theta gang get their tendies.

&#x200B;

**The strategy** I have for you is simple: Buy way OTM puts dated a year or more into the future on your company. Roll them over to a later date either quarterly or annually. In the event of a systemic shock that destroys your company, you pay yourself a fat unemployment check. If your company is too small to buy LEAPS on, find another company or two in the same industry to buy the puts on.

Mathematically, the goal is to spend about 1% of your annual income on these puts in such a way that if your employer collapses you secure 25% of your annual income to fall back on. If the market is efficient, this bet should pay off about 1 in 25 years. Since the business cycle lasts about 9 years, this means that you are hedging that your employer is specifically affected by an overall downturn in about one in three business cycles and gives insurance against less systemic risks that might destroy them.

You should calculate the correct strikes yourself for your employer, but a good heuristic is that a one year put 15%-25% OTM will have the correct properties. Volatile companies will have more expensive options, and therefore will require more capital to secure a potential payout of several months salary. But they are volatile for a reason and that reason likely impacts the odds you will continue having a job so the more expensive insurance is warranted.

&#x200B;

Consider these made up **anecdotes** about Frank, a Boeing plant worker, and Tom, an Enron regional energy operations manager.  The option premiums are my best estimates based off of experience buying/selling LEAPS. If you have historical premiums data I would love to see it.

Frank gets paid $60k a year at Boeing. He's started making this bet every year since he started working for Boeing in 2010 after losing his construction job during the 2008 recession. At $600/year for insurance he has paid out $6000 so far. He rebalances his one put contract on 01/01/2020 paying $6/share for 2021 puts at $285 strike (\~13% OTM). $BA hasn't been very volatile lately so the premiums are cheap. The Wuhan plague hits and $BA plunges to a low of $90. Frank sells the contract for $200/share benefiting additionally from the pump in IV. Frank makes a little under $20k on this trade which is 4 months pay. He nets $14k on the trade considering the amount he spent during previous years. Frank feels no anxiety about losing his job when the plant gets shutdown.

Tom gets paid $400k a year at Enron. He knows some shady stuff happens at Enron, but that happens at all the energy firms he thinks. Tom has been playing this strategy since he started working for Enron in '88. He made some money on it during an energy shock in the 90's but only enough to cover 2 years of option premiums. He rolls over his $4,000 worth of contracts in January 2001 when Enron is trading at $80, buying 12 contracts with a strike at $60 because Enron volatility has been high for $3.30/share. Later that year the Enron scandal is uncovered and the stock price collapses to $0 before the year is over. Tom makes $72k. Net after previous years is therefore $28k. He can pay the mortgage on his new and fugly Texas McMansion while he looks for a job.

I imagine once we see HTZ earnings they will fall between 65-75%, not quite as high as CAR. 

HTZ is a big player in the airport segment but also has replacement business at their local levels propping them up, where CAR is pretty much strictly limited to corporate and retail business. That’s why I think they will get hit harder with negative growth. 

However, HTZ is in big trouble due to missed lease payments on April 27. They have until tomorrow to come up with a way to pay. Unfortunately, they can’t just sell the cars because every dealership across the nation is closed and buyer demand is gone. They have no way to offload their inventory. They are heavily considering filing for bankruptcy after hiring corporate restructuring consultants. 

I know you’re thinking they have fallen quite a bit and all this is already priced in after CAR reported it’s earnings. But, if you look at CAR guidance, they think they are going to get even harder in the coming months even with reopenings in place. Along with this, Buffet announced he pulled out of airlines, I think we see these stocks follow another decline with the the airlines as they rely on the airport business to stay afloat. 

If you have driven past any of these companies local stores, you will see they’re loaded to the tits with cars and they are paying for space off site for all the other cars they can’t hold on site. Side note to this: there was recently a large fire for one of these off site lots that caused a ton of damage to inventory. Projected at a $90 million loss for the three top dogs but HTZ got hit hardest. Most people think they’re backed by insurance but they’re self-insured, so this is a huge loss on top of the missed revenue. 

On top of all of this bad news, HTZ isn’t even a strong company to begin with. 

I don’t see these companies weathering this storm without a bailout, but what do I know I’m retarded.

1900,Discussion,Where the market is headed...plus virus update,152,gcvrhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcvrhe/where_the_market_is_headedplus_virus_update/,64,1588560116.0," I'll reiterate these are just my opinions, but all of the numbers or stats I mention are correct from sources like WSJ, Bloomberg, NYT etc. plus individual research.

The virus:

As Im sure you've seen recently there has been a lot of media coverage on Remdesivir, the first possible therapeutic for COVID. I have seen various different claims to how effective it is, from Gilead the maker to obscure media outlets like STAT which originally reported it was very effective at wiping out the virus. The WHO leaked the results of a study from China last week that claimed there was no statistical significance between patients who were given a regimen of the drug, and those who werent. This study was double-blind, and had a control group, but was smallish with only I believe around 100 participants. The WHO then pulled this article from their site shortly after it went up. Days later, the official report from China was released the morning of the GDP drop of the month of March which came in at -4.8%, the biggest drop since 2009.  

Funnily enough, that same morning both the GDP report and the small China study were released for Remdesivir, Gilead came out saying that a study in the US patients given the drug resulted in a drop of hospitalization time from 14 days to 11 days, with ~50% of patients improving who had severe results. This covered up the China story quickly. The market jumped 3% and it was blasted on all media outlets that this was the first therapeutic. The flaw in this study was there was no control group, so in my opinion it is nearly impossible to measure how succesful the drug was. It was also not coincidence that this news dropped the same day as the official China study came out. I remain skeptical at how good this drug will turn out to be, but there are much larger studies set to be released in the coming weeks. There are also over 200 different therapies and vaccine trials going on worldwide. Without getting too far into detail, Bill Gates sees 7-10 vaccine trials as being very hopeful with a timeframe of 9-18 months. I personally believe it will be by the end of the year we have a good vaccine option or therapeutic with 90% + effectiveness that will only be available for emergency use. Gates sees the logistics of making billions of drug doses safely as the larger challenge, and that taking longer than expected because it's literally never been done. 

In terms of the latest research about mortality and contagion, it seems that the R-naught (how many people you spread the virus to once you are infected) is much higher than anticipated. Bill Gates seems to think it's around 5. So for every one person who gets it, you give it to 5 people if left unmitigated. Obviously an exponential curve. The reason its so difficult to contain is because how much of a ""viral load"" you are exposed to determines how symptomatic you are, and how sick you get- for the most part. There are reports of people having very high loads and not being symptomatic. Again a reason why its so difficult to track. Social distancing has reduced this R-naught in nearly every state to below 1 or to about 0.8 in most places, which is maintained the virus would eventually fizzle out slowly. Unfortunately, the minute restrictions are lifted the number will rise possibly to above 1 and you will see cases start to climb exponentially again. A great website that illustrates this I've linked here: https://rt.live/

Mortality is tricky because it is so biased on age. It seems that the mortality rate on average will be much lower than the ~5% current US statistics report. This is because the denominator for the calculation is likely between 10-50 times larger depending on location than reported cases. An antibody study for NY saw that around 20% of the population has had the virus already. My guess is places where outbreaks are bad the numbers are much higher than reported, and places where numbers are low the reported cases are much more accurate. In all likelihood we will never know the actual number. The death rate for young healthy people without underlying conditions is about 0. The death rate for anyone around 40 without underlying conditions is close to 0, and anyone above 40 with underlying conditions it is pretty dangerous to risk going out. About 95% of the cases are considered ""mild"", but mild cases are like the worst flu you've ever had, and the symptoms last for weeks. Also new reports suggest not only does this ravage the lungs, but it can also cause permanent heart and brain damage for unknown reasons. People have reported upticks in seizures after getting the virus. All in all not great. 

I believe we are past the biggest peak of cases if things continue as they have been, but opening up will cause there to be more peaks to come. Probably we will have limited opening and closing of much of the economy all over the country at different points until we have herd immunity or a breakthrough in medicine. The best visual I've seen is a sinusoidal wave that has lower peak to troughs as time goes on. The Y axis being new cases, the X being time. The one anomaly that gives me hope is Sweden which has not locked down but it seems slowly gained/gaining herd immunity. A more likely scenario for the US is Singapore, which is now undergoing strict lockdowns after an initial first wave- they are in the second. What I see is indisputable at this point is we won't ever go back to a complete normal until a vaccine or a 95% + therapeutic. 

The economy

As I mentioned, there were multiple enormous stimulus packages that were released during the past five weeks. The fed successfully backstopped the credit and equity markets from completely collapsing, which would have happened if they didn't flood an unprecedented amount of liquidity into both markets. 

On a daily basis for the past few weeks the fed has bought around $70 billion of credit, more than entire months of the last few years. They have slowly waned off of this ridiculous buying, but what it did besides stabalize markets is completely disconnect market fundamentals from prices. This is why we have seen an over 60% retracement of the initial drop in the stock market the past month. I believe this is now over, and I am taking a leap to say the peak of the rally was last Thursday. I could be wrong, but from a technical perspective a number of indicators say Thursday might've been it. I am suggesting if you are in stocks that have had a significant updraft since the lows of the past few weeks, I would sell into strength. Despite the unprecedented measures of monetary and fiscal stimulus brought on by the government, and the media headlines of the 'new bull market', the government can only support, not supplant consumer demand. 

Estimates of corporate earnings continue to rocket downwards, and the most recent GDP estimate for Q2 is between 30-40% decline. This is not on an annualized basis, but then you need to consider the rebound which is why the market has recovered so much- all hope that the recovery will be V shaped. I believe the recovery wont be nearly as fast as the market has priced in, which is a V. Trump seems to be on this side which has promoted what I consider false hope in many. Even if there is a relatively fast medical breakthrough, 30 million people are now unemployed, with the actual number likely 20% or more higher than 30 million. This means that every single job since the financial crisis' peak unemployment is now gone. 30 million people is 18% of the labor force. Many of these jobs might be temporary layoffs, but the labor participation rate has been declining since the 90s. And with the government's generous $600 a week unemployment check plus state unemployment, anyone making less than $15 an hour would be making less working than sitting at home. In other words, the government is incentivizing companies to lay off workers. These benefits will likely go into 2021, greatly slowing the economic recovery. Also, most small restaurants and consumer businesses cannot sustainably be open at 25% capacity. It is more economically viable to stay closed with no expenses other than rent and utilities than be open paying employees more than $15 an hour at 1/4 capacity with 1/4 tips. 

The market 

We have retraced and bounced off of the 61% level, an important level many people trade on. We also broke the uptrend from the past few weeks, and were trading on ever thinning volume. Additionally, Buffet's favorite market indicator tracking market-cap/GDP is at an all-time high. The market is also extremely top heavy, meaning 5 companies make up more than 20% of the total S&amp;P market cap. Commodities are also tanking, with oil below 20$ a barrel, hitting -40 last week for a day. The last time all of these conditions were in place while the market ticked every higher on hope was the 2001 internet bubble. This is where it gets interesting, if you werent already riveted by this rambling mess of an email. 

During the market crash, 7/10 retail market participants (us) didnt motify their positions at all. Of the 3 that did, the vast majority actually added stocks, only 16% sold them. One of the key indicators of a market bottom is capitulation, when everyone thinks it'll never end. The market bottoms when there is no one else left to sell. 16% selling doesn't sound like capitulation to me. 

Looking at fundamentals, the forward-12 months earnings for the aggregate S&amp;P has been falling precipitously over the past few weeks with the consensus is around $125 a share, a 30% drop from pre-coronavirus levels. This is how much earnings dropped in 2008, and I think this drop will be worse overall so in my opinion it is a conservative estimate. Multiplying that by the average P/E ratio of the past 50 years you get 2,100 for the S&amp;P. Multiplying it by a more realistic number you get 1800. We are trading at ~2850 as of close Friday. This would give an implied P/E forward looking ratio of ~23, the second highest in history after the 2001 bubble. I don't think we will hit 1800 as of now because of what the fed has done, but it isn't out of the question. Many highly regarded investors like Scott Minerd, Jeff Gundlach, and Ray Dalio agree. Minerd sees a worst-case of 1500 for the S&amp;P. 

In summay, I believe we are at the peak of a long term debt cycle. I believe the levels of debt accumulated during this crisis will inhibit investment from consumers and corporations for years to come. 40% of Americans couldn't afford an unexpected expense of $400 without taking on debt before this crisis- during the longest economic expansion in US history. Over the past decade the recovery was the slowest ever since WWII, and the interest rates never got above 2.5% historically very very low, which begs the question why was it so slow? This will change consumer behavior like the Great Depression did, hopefully for the better. But the enormous government responses globally will also fundamentally change how the world operates. Printing money at billions a week is not sustainable, and inflation will occur at some point. For now, the dollar is in such high demand we are likely to see a sustained period of delation, which further hurts an economic recovery and investment. Why would you hire a new employee now if it will cost you less in the future- deflation. I know this sounds doom and gloom, but it's not meant to be. Buffet had his annual meeting today and said America will get through this, and I totally agree. It's just I believe this is a 9/11 or great depression type event that will change our behavior in ways that we don't know yet. Honestly, in the long run probably positively. But from a growth perspective and from the market, it does offer an opportunity. 

I could be totally wrong, but if I am I’m going to question everything I know about finance because that’ll prove money grows on trees. Then again Tesla is the second most valuable car company in the world worth $150 billion and its stock is up 70% for the year, and it had income of $16 million the last quarter- so maybe money does grow on trees. 

TLDR: The market is on the brink of collapse and will start next week. 1800-2100 SPX.

It's about 4 weeks later (earnings 5/5) so you could see at least 15 million more subscribers not even accounting for the 20% coronavirus boost. And Similarweb shows traffic up 81% see here: https://i.imgur.com/7SWoNYb.png   

If they hit 70 million subscribers that's likely profitable. Yeah parks are going to be down, but only closed on March 12th so the impact will be barely felt into earnings. The only thing that will matter is this subscriber number. Disney will easily show that they are well capitalized and the transition to digital will show that they can weather the next year. The timing of Disney Plus is near perfect. Disney has already quickly moved movie debuts online including the amazing Artemis Fowl (if you dont have this on your calendar put it on for June 12 and then buy DIS calls then too cuz that shit is tight).

There are so many geopolitical cliffhangers right now that could just go Mad Max in the medium-term:       
  
- Venezuela on the brink of political collapse. Low oil prices give no incentive for outsiders to come stabilize the country to get it. Could spill guerilla warfare across many regions in S. America.         
- Whole swathes of countries that require oil revenue to maintain economic stability that will revert into ethnic conflict without the good times.       
- Countries that depend on globalized trade and exports to support their economy due to no domestic consumption base: e.g. Germany.      
- China, a country that is fucked politically, historically, ethnically, and that depends on globalization and exports to get foreign currency to obtain the raw materials it has none of.         
- US withdrawing its military global police, allowing conflicts to spring up again.

- we see the unemployment exploding 
- no vaccine for at least the end of the year (even if it were today to announce one, it still needs to be manufactured, distributed and given to billions - fuck yeah- of people)
- even if they cancel the lockdown orders, I don’t think that the tourism companies, airlines, casinos, bars&restaurants, etc will resume operations as nothing happens. Or that everybody will start buying cars or long term goods when their future is still uncertain. Lifting the lockdown orders does not mean restarting the economy. It is a fallacy to believe that. 
- a lot of bankruptcies and personal defaults are due to happen. I cannot believe that everybody has enough resources to survive a few months, especially in a world which is based on JIT (just in time) Think about the oil industry, especially shale oil, airlines, deep indebted companies, etc.

My position is firmly away from the trend, so I am going about living my shelter-at-home life.  I figure that, at least, I am not slowly asphyxiating in a sports area hastily transformed to a makeshift hospital.

(Possible unpopular opinion): The Fed can't replace the economy, can't prop it up forever, and are likely not to not continue once it is clear they cannot functionally control, contain, or address the damage that has already happened.

This is where ""Rogue One"" comes in.

The view on this beach is great. There is a lovely sunset, and far off in the distance, you can see the shock wave traveling at terminal velocity across the face of the planet towards us. Pretty. I wonder if I can roast a marshmallow on a shock wave.

* So whole industries such as restaurants, cruise lines, and hospitality are 40+ days into a near zero income, are not likely to acquire adequate cash to deal with ongoing expenses for the duration of the crisis, and are facing multiple years of lower consumer demand
* Reopening the economy now is basically like pouring Robitussin into an open compound fracture.  Reopening now absolutely does not solve the fundamental math problems of the Covid-19 crisis, and will only create a resurgence or a second wave, or both
* Regardless of how well we handle the first, we are very likely to see a second wave, which will likely need to be dealt with the same way the first one was (that should go over very well)
* The crest of first wave hasn't even reached all of the county yet. People are still getting sick in increasing numbers in some places in the country, and the only way to stop is quickly becoming wildly unpopular with a vocal minority
* So many people are out of work, that the knock-on effects of unemployment on this scale can cause a recession and cripple any number of consumer goods companies without even considering other effects (of which there are legion)

So the damage is already done, the compounding and knock-on effects are piling up, thankfully we have a solid pillow fort built from sacks of money to keep us safe.  Anyone looking at the horizon can see that there is a shock-wave hurtling towards us.  I, for one, am curious what it will feel like to be converted to human paste and cooked in pico seconds.

I don't exactly know what is going to make it clear that the Fed cannot buy up the entire economy, cant hire 6 in 10 Americans, and can't scare away the boogy man by making it rain new crisp bills. If I had to guess, I would say we shall see in November when the second round of shelter-at-home orders comes down to deal with our old pal exponential growth.

RIP my positions (until November, then RIP everything).

Earnings profits: CVS sold out of every retail store during corona and offers stay at home services.

Volume is decent.

Earnings report event indicator shows that all earnings that were positive increased stock price where only three events in the past two years resulted in a decline in share prices.

CVS is predicted to out perform by 27 different analysts with no one indicating a sell signal and one hold signal. 

Also CVS has a great balance with assets double liabilities which is good for the retail Pharma industry.

CVS is also trading below moving average, is undervalued.

Past 2 years earnings has only fell 3 times with very little price chance when but it beats earnings the other times it moons

1940,Discussion,Why The United States Cannot Shut Down For A Second Wave Even Though It Will,1207,gdnell,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdnell/why_the_united_states_cannot_shut_down_for_a/,529,1588666512.0,"During one of the coronavirus task force briefings, an admiral came up and detailed how he was getting ventilators into the system. Much of the press was outraged when he detailed it out because the government was using a middle man that was profiting off it. The admiral’s response? “My job is not to invent a system. My job is to put volume in the system.”

Such is the realities of leadership in a time of crisis.

So. When the Fed went into ‘save everything mode,’ they did so with a desire to unfreeze credit markets and make sure markets functioned. Powell’s job was to put volume into the system.

That system now has volume. And plenty of it. Everyone is buying everyone else’s debt. Disney wants five billion for a year? Wells Fargo says ‘COUNT ME IN.’ Boeing is issuing bonds? ‘IT’S A RAID,’ says every person with access to debt markets. Delta can’t fly 10% capacity this quarter. People buy their debt like it’s the liftoff of the 747.

So the system now has ample volume going back and forth. Everyone’s leveraged to the tits in new debt. What could possibly go wrong?

30-50 million unemployed is what’s wrong.

Already high household debt continues to skyrocket as new income falls off a cliff is what’s wrong.

Reckless debt issuance and a borrowing system that never really reset after 2008-9 is what’s wrong.

In what will likely go down as the dumbest FOMO among smart money of all time, every major institution has tried its best to get in on every company’s debt offerings. But what happens if Delta sees just 30% of flying traffic in the third quarter? What if California and France refuse to open Disney’s parks until early July and shut them down again in September as precaution? And would anyone really be surprised if Boeing doesn’t get the 737 max off the ground until 2021?

These events have a decent probability of happening. And such companies as Delta and Boeing may not be able to service their debt at the end of 2020 if, say, we have to shut everything back down to prevent a second wave.

Not every bond holder is going to get screwed. But the rate of defaults on loans is going to be much higher than the laughable estimates JPM and Well’s have set cash aside for.

Let’s keep in mind: it wasn’t the Fed’s job to invent a new system. Its job was to keep the current system functioning.

So what is the system they’re pumping? The debt system. And all they’ve really done is re-inflate a debt bubble to a much bigger size than it was in February. And given the details released today by the Fed essentially announcing they'll be buying HYG and LQD, this bubble is growing to hindenburg-sized levels.

With people putting their rent on credit cards, our system is just surviving right now. But what happens in wave two?

Boeing can’t pay its coupon as Delta withdraws all orders so it can attempt to service debt too big to pay itself. An empire like Disney looks at risk for shuttering. Restaurants are seen as germ lands by the average consumer and nobody goes dining in for several years. Housing construction companies simply cannot survive the epic demand and supply destruction with defaults on mortgages skyrocketing as well. Fannie and Freddie make 2008 look like a prelude to the real story. And the Fed may have to try and get out of HYG as companies in the ETF fail and they have to preserve tax payer dollars as per their legal obligation, which will only further feed the negative feedback loop.

At Buffet’s shareholder meeting saturday, he praised Powell’s speed to get credit markets functioning again. On top of that, he said March was the highest bond issuance month of all time, followed by April breaking that record.

But here’s what’s interesting in what he said: “We don’t know what the consequences of this will be.”

So perhaps we are somehow able to punt the debt bubble pop down the road by allowing all loans to defer for extended periods. Perhaps the US government is able to find some way to write off certain types of debt in a last resort effort to avoid economic catastrophe. They will certainly get creative as everyone becomes desperate. But in all likelihood, these kinds of ideas are untenable without resulting in extreme damage to other segments of the economy.

We are on the brink of the debt bubble collapse. And given a second wave, we will create a negative feedback loop that will slump the United States Markets for years.

I don't believe we will have a 10 year great depression. We learned so much from that time period and we will use that knowledge to recover faster, and maybe even better. But like the civil war, world war one, and world war two: everyone thought at the beginning of each outbreak it was only going to last a few months. We think the same thing now about this crisis.

TL;DR: Often when you are operating in a paradigm you don’t realize the flaw of that paradigm until you are forced to shift into a new paradigm. The debt bubble paradigm is about to shift, but not before it pops.",2020-05-05 04:15:12,-0.9995,0.4215,-0.10741503355704696,-0.228471677852349

I have absolutely NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO PUMP, you invest at your own discretion. I personally believe this is the beginning of another Super Bull market for tankers (See the 80’s and mid 2000’s for context) and have 95% of my account invested in the above 3 companies (50% calls and 50% stock). Sorry no NAT for me, more upside on the above companies. I’ll keep this short and let you read the sources yourself:

SKIP TO THE END FOR SOME FUN INFO ON SCORPIO PRESIDENT, ROBERT BUGBEE

**Storage (1):**

We saw last week that tanker shares took a bit of a hit. Why? In volatile tanker markets, the price of the share often times mimics the daily spot prices for the various VLCC’s, LR2’s, etc. Now it shouldn’t be completely dictated this way due to TC rates, etc., but unfortunately market sediment can drive the price more than hard data. Here is a simple recap of last week:

&#x200B;

[Tanker stocks in decline last week \(above\) compared to spot rates decline last week \(below\) ------ I realize the above is only 2 days, the whole week looked the same.](https://preview.redd.it/xo0w9hixntw41.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=df022769dac9b9902fc0d2cbc40f9eb39715c9b4)

&#x200B;

[Rates in Decline last week \(Projected to shoot up in mid May when June contracts expire\)](https://preview.redd.it/3imkexajotw41.jpg?width=1616&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ced85be58a75348f370f1afeafb0cfa6e872a30c)

Here is a quick recap of how it happened:

1. Some States prepare to partially open. The price of oil increases based on speculation of demand increase. Hence the front month oil futures contract increases, which means……..
2. Contango begins to flatten. If you don’t know what this means yet it’s just arbitrage, it’s buying a commodity, in our case an oil contract at a cheaper price today then it will be in 3 months. Oil contract contains a thousand barrels. You buy a contract (1000 barrels) at $15/barrel the contract costs you $15,000, and you then hope to profit at a later date by selling it at $30/barrel, netting a nice profit. Do this with a few thousand contracts and you can be sitting pretty.
3. Last week we had bad speculation as investors ran screaming after hearing news that daily spot rates decreased....... because obviously we moved away from the most insane Contango in history: remember WTI [as it went negative](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart)? VLCC’s spot rates dropped from 200k to 100k over the week, oh my gosh, SELL, SELL SELL!!! However most of these gents failed to realize that 100k is still 4x the average rate for years pass.  Yes obviously rates are going to be the highest during the period around oil contract expiration. What they don’t tell you, is at the rate we are using up storage (there is some 160+ million barrels already sitting at sea and 50 million being added per week), if we enter into another Contango for the June contracts which expire on 5/19/2020 (which is looking inevitable), there are projections that daily spot rates could reach 500k/day.

**Storage (2):**

[Cushing](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macro-voices/id1079172742?i=1000473204536) is building at an incredible rate and while you may see people misinterpret headlines like [this](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/oil-glut-set-to-halve-in-may-and-shrink-to-6-million-bpd-in-june-but-storage-cant-breathe/), the fact remains that we are still building the glut, and fast, but an estimated build of [13.6 million](https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/oil-glut-set-to-halve-in-may-and-shrink-to-6-million-bpd-in-june-but-storage-cant-breathe/) barrels per/day is forecasted for May. If you are out drowning in a pool of oil and you begin to drown a little slower, you're not being rescued and you're not working your way out, you're still drowning buddy. This glut is not being reversed anytime soon. What many don't realize is that much of the Permian is still pumping, yes that's right, many of these companies are hedged through 2020 and will pump as long as there is a pipeline to take it. Contrary to what you might believe, a negative WTI price doesn't meant their losing their books. Oh and let's not forget Russia and SA increased oil production in April to all time highs (below). Lastly, oil works like any other free market, if the price goes up, people will sell more. Oil is not being cut while we quickly and neatly use up all the surplus and then all politely turn our wells back on at the same time. The minute oil increase in price, countries start increasing their production to maximize revenue, the glut starts to build and we go through it again. This surplus isn't being worked off in 6 months, we are talking years.

**NAV**

I dont have the energy for this as everything is bullish and you can't google it without seeing the undervalue. Most of the above companies are still trading below Net Asset Value (NAV), meaning if they went belly up today and had to sell all assets and turn around and pay of debt, guess what, there would still be enough left over to pay share holders more than the current stock price. STNG last week was trading at \~75% NAV which is ludicrous. After today it's still trading below NAV and right before an earnings drop where we have seen some of the highest LR2 rates ever.

**Closing (This is it!)**

Check out this interview from [Robert Bugbee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVkLM6gx7E8), CEO of STNG, and watch that mad lad say at the 2019 Annual Product Shipping Forum LAST YEAR, that due to IMO 2020, STNG was going to increase in price by 50% (At about 7:45 time in the video), which it did last year, before tankers got hammered in the beginning of the year along with everyone else. Now with IMO 2020 and the Covid supply glut, I wonder what he is going to say Wednesday when earnings drop lol, my guess is stonks go into orbit. Oh and did I forget to mention, that same Mr. Bugbee bought 2 million calls on STNG in March. Granted his strike and premiums were a little more attractive lol, [HE IS ONE OF US!](http://classicvalueinvestors.com/2020/04/15/president-of-scorpio-tankers-speaking/) He is the way, do not miss this earnings and guidance forecast with STNG.

TL;DR ------- You need to be in this trade, not just options, buy shares as well for some monster dividends. Yes that's right stocks, instead of Yolo'ing your entire savings away on 30% OTM Tesla puts you can make some serious cash off these tankers for the next 6 months...... Then go blow it all, but at least do one thing right before you go down in flames.

DOUBLE TL;DR ------- Listen to the above interview with Robert Bugbee and keep in mind he has $millions in calls on STNG (yes he does this legally), and let that sweet bit of information rock you to sleep tonight.

TRIPLE TL;DR -------- You still have not missed the boat. STNG is going to the stratosphere Wednesday and EURN on Thursday when earnings come out.

**POSITIONS**

[Picking up a lot more STNG tomorrow](https://preview.redd.it/qcvv0vhj3uw41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cb2295eea2a809ddb98c4b4cbb9a582ec2a5a2e)

At the end of the day what do I know. Do your own research. This is a once in a life time opportunity that hasn't passed yet.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

To all you fellas that got your pants pulled down today..... so did I. As I have now said numerous times, this market is so volatile right now and can be derailed by a ridiculous tweet from Trump. LISTEN TO THE ASC earnings call which is happening now!!! They smashed earning by 50% Q1 and are projecting a heck of a lot more than that come Q2. LR2 tankers, which STNG is the world leader in these product boats, is now smashing VLCC Rates by 3x. (56k/day for VLCC vs 155k/day for STNG).

You will thank me tomorrow after earnings. Cut ties on some others companies if you are unsure, but STNG and their product boats are going to print so much money you won't see straight. Even more so as Contango widens come next week and oil prices fall. This is my opinion and I have no intention of selling. If you saw STNG this morning it was up 4% pre market so this baby had every intention of taking off. I am planning on this tomorrow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

Scorpio (STNG) Earnings Report just released, smashed earnings estimates by 60% for Q1 (.82 vs expected of .51). Earnings call incoming. STNG currently up pre market. Although there are news of oil cuts today, supply levels are still soaring. Contango inbound next week, STNG goes parabolic...... at least thats what I am betting on.

My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

&#x200B;

First things first. Remember that we are reading *Money; A Suicide Note* for the [WSB Books event](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g85inu/wsbooks_vol_1_money_a_suicide_note_4pm_et_516/). It can be bought (which is recommended) or [downloaded here](https://epdf.pub/money-a-suicide-note129e7b0df400a345810ae585631783a94603.html). It will download as a LIT file then upload it to [this site](https://anyconv.com/lit-to-pdf-converter/) and re-download as a PDF. This event is aimed at making everyone a better trader and having a little autistic fun at the same time.  Now for the DD.

&#x200B;

**Z;**  Let's take a look at Zillow. They are an interesting company. This is an excerpt straight from their website;

>Zillow serves the full lifecycle of owning and living in a home: buying, selling, renting, financing, remodeling and more. It starts with Zillow's living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes - including homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the market

They are a big business raking in $2.7 billion in 2019. However, looking at [their 10-K](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/z#link_fullReport) from that same year shows a $300 million loss which is up about $180 million from 2018. That's not good. They are consistently spending much more than they bring in but somehow are still seen as a good company. Their debt also rose in 2019 from about $700 million in long term debt to a whopping $1.5 BILLION. All these numbers are straight from their 10-K (Feel free to thank me and thank u/fuzzyblankeet too for teaching me how to understand this shit). At the end of 2019 they had 2,707 homes in their inventory.

Now you ask, “What do we do with all these big numbers that I don't understand?”, and I say, “You just fucking look at them.” So here is what we can take away from this. This is a company that is consistently losing money, has more than doubled their debt in a year, and much of their asset value comes from owning 2,707 houses. What happens to the price of homes in a recession? It fucking drops… like a lot. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdbzyn/home_sales_to_fall_up_to_60/) goes over some basic stuff but more importantly it shows what they just released which is a statement saying it might take UNTIL 2021 TO RECOVER. Damn, that sucks. Earnings come out on 5/7 after close so puts for 5/15 because you can't sell options that expire that day. But more than that, this is a long term play too. Zillow will not do well in a recession and we haven't quite entered one yet. If you want, look far out for puts. Could be a smart thing especially given all this information.

&#x200B;

**Next Leg Down;** For another explanation on why we are rising in the midst of a pandemic,  read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd1t2g/dddd_the_rise_of_buy_the_dip_retail_investors_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) or read the last few lines right here;

>This entire bull rally has been fueled by new retail investors buying the dip, bringing the stock price to euphoric levels. Over the past few weeks, we’ve been seeing the people waiting at the sidelines for years to get into the stock market slowly FOMO into the rally in smaller and smaller volumes, while the smart money have been locking in their profits at an even slower rate - hence an ascending wedge. As the amount of new retail interest in the stock market started slowed down, the amount of new bulls started to decline. This doesn’t mean we’ll instantly go back to circuit breakers, we might see 282 -> 274 -> 284 -> 274 happen before panic, this time by the first-time investors, eventually bringing us down.

I cut a couple things out so this isn't a direct quote but it's what you need to understand. Millions of first time investors are “buying the dip” and when they stop doing this in such large numbers then the real gravity of the situation we are in will hit. It will be all Uh-oh’s and fuck-me’s from then till we hit the bottom.

&#x200B;

**Oil Reminder;**  Oh and remember those tanker plays I recommended on the [4/9-4/13](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g0nkrl/summary_of_dd_from_49413_insider_trading_oil/) post? Those fucking printed. So remember the [4/23-4/24](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g7f1m6/dd_from_423424_live_nation_oil_starbucks_and/) post I made about land based oil storage? Those are going to print too so get in while you can.

&#x200B;

**Unusual Activity;** This isn't a big thing for me but it may help a few of you.  CNX Resources (CNX) is an oil and gas company and their earnings were terrible. Here's what is interesting; there was 32K open interest for Jul 6P, 28k puts for Oct 5p, and only 10k calls for Oct. Isn't that a little strange. That a lot of volume for a small company, seems like someone knows something we don't.

Then there is Wright Medical Group NV (WMGI) which makes medical devices like joint implants and bone fixation devices for the foot and ankle and some other shit. They have 10k Aug 25P, 10k Aug 30p, and less than 4k volume for every other month. Weird. Do what you want with this information. I don't plan to do anything with these and wont include them in the TLDR or Plays. Here is [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcgyg5/3_unusual_options_activity_from_last_week/) going into more detail about this.

&#x200B;

Last thing, I plan to make an entire separate post detailing my strategy when doing earnings plays tomorrow. I will go over how I decide when to sell and what it looks like when things go wrong. I decided to leave it out of the DD summaries because it is its own category and would take up a lot of space in already long posts. Let me know if you guys are interested in this!

&#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

**TLDR;** Zillow is absolute horse shit, next leg down is because of all the new money, land based oil is a good idea along with tankers, earnings play information session will come out tomorrow.

1946,DD,[Serious] Understanding WHY tanker companies like STNG and DHT are attractive buys (and NAT is not),107,gdktr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdktr7/serious_understanding_why_tanker_companies_like/,103,1588657345.0,"There was a post yesterday with loads of 'DD' discussing tanker companies and why they're attractive targets going in to earnings, etc.  Unfortunately this post (  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd01t7/serious\_on\_the\_oil\_demand\_crisis\_and\_why\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd01t7/serious_on_the_oil_demand_crisis_and_why_you/)  ) is laden with misinformation and demonstrates a clear lack of understanding about what has been driving the freight markets and why certain tanker companies are positioned to do well going forward.

Some key things we'll go over that you need to understand are:  floating storage economics,  contango in the forward curve (for crude and gasoil aka. distillate),  scrubber saturation across a tanker fleet and the price differential between IMO 2020 compliant marine fuel and pre-2020 compliant fuel oil.

&#x200B;

Definitions:

Contango:  where the nearby price of a future is less than that of the next one. I.E.  July brent settled at 27.20 today where August was 28.68, so the Jul/Aug spread settled at -1.48/bbl.

Forward freight curve:  these are the prices that you can trade for forward freight prices.  

Floating storage:  where the company/trader booking the vessel has no intent of actually shipping anything on it, they are booking the vessel to store crude/product on it because the contango market structure allows them to collect more money rolling their physical length down the curve than the ship costs.  

Example of floating storage economics:   Using the -1.48 Jul/Aug brent spread as an example; if you could book a 1,000kb (1 million bbls) ship that costs you $33,000/day, you book it, load it with spot crude, and buy the jul/aug spread at -1.48.  Then you can turn around and sell that crude in August.   So 33k/day \* 30 days = $990k for the boat,  you're collecting $1.48/bbl in contango, on 1mil bbls, = $1.48m.  So before TVM and operational costs, you're looking at tidy $490k profit for putting your oil on a boat on month and taking it off the boat next month.

IMO 2020:    As of January 1st, all vessels at sea had to start burning a lower sulphur fuel oil (sulphur = S going forward) .  Prior to this, you could burn fuel that had up to 3.5%S,  now (Jan 1) you can only burn fuel that has 0.5%S.  Guess what, 0.5%S costs way more to blend than 3.5%S.  Let's call the spread between 0.5%S and 3.5%S the 'scrubber advantage', the wider this spread, the bigger advantage a scrubber fleet has over non-scrubber fleets.

Scrubbers:  Scrubbers are devices that are installed on the exhaust stacks of tankers.  These nifty devices allow a ship to burn non-compliant fuel oil.  I.E. you can still buy the 3.5%S fuel because the scrubber cleans the exhaust so the emission looks like you're burning 0.5%S.  

Scrubber saturation:  what % of a tanker company's fleet has scrubbers installed, allowing them to use cheaper fuel than a company that has no scrubbers.

One more definition for you,  is the TD3 freight future.  This is a good benchmark to look at for large tanker dirty freight around the globe.  It is the rate that the Baltic Exchange publishes every day for the freight route from Middle East Gulf to China for 270,000 metric ton cargoes.  

&#x200B;

Now that we have those definitions out of the way, let's try to understand why STNG has moved the way it has since the beginning of the year until now.  Please pull up the following charts:

NAT:   [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE:NAT](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE:NAT) 

STNG:  [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE:STNG](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NYSE:STNG) 

&#x200B;

Let's talk about January through to the first week of March.  COVID is fucking things up across the globe, refineries are producing 0.5%S fuel oil to meet anticipated demand for the new IMO 2020 compliant fuel (that no one really needs now because shipping demand sucks) and freight rates are falling because there is greatly reduced shipping demand.  

So for Jan 1 through to the first week of March:

•TD3 / freight rates are falling

•scrubber spread is dropping 

•crude spreads aren't yet at floating storage levels.  

This means tanker companies are going to suffer, and they sure do reflect that.  Why does STNG drop off more than NAT?  Because of the scrubber spread.  Their price advantage of having a huge amount of scrubbers installed across their fleet has gone from over $200/mt to $120/mt.  

&#x200B;

Enter the Saudi/Russia price war.   On March 5th Opec had a meeting in Vienna where they decided to cut production, so long as Russia and other non-OPEC members of 'OPEC+' agreed to do so.  On March 6th, Russia rejected this demand, and on March 8th, SA announced they would INCREASE their production.  This price war resulted in crude oil prices, and more importantly for the tanker market, crude spreads got demolished.   Take a look at the rolling front month vs. Dec '20 brent chart you have open and look at what happened after March 6th.  We went from around -1/bbl contango to -8.60/bbl contango over the course of just a few trading sessions.  Now look at your TD3 / freight chart and you'll see freight rates ripped in that same time period.  This is because traders around the world were locking in floating storage plays, not because of any actual shipping demand.  These floating storage plays continued for quite some time.  

&#x200B;

As you'd expect, tanker companies start to appreciate and resist the macro sell-off that was happening from March 1st to the 23rd.  While they were jumping as much as freight rates, look at SPX in that time period and they were doing quite well against the indices.  

&#x200B;

Crude spreads saw a huge recovery in early April, and as you'd expect, freight rates dropped as no one was booking ships for floating storage and actual shipping demand was hard to find at such inflated freight levels.  No fear, brent spreads were to shit the bed again through to April 22nd which was our recent bottom.  And look at your freight chart,  that was the recent high on TD3.  As the crude contango makes floating storage plays un-economical, that means we need to return to a shipping market that is relying on actual shipping demand, not floating storage econs.  

Guess what, the world is still fucked with COVID, and while many think we are on the other side of it, shipping demand still isn't close to what it was pre-COVID.  

As to why STNG hasn't recovered the same way NAT has, again we look at the scrubber spread.  The scrubbers that were installed were done so at fixed cost.  So that price advantage of $60/mt instead of $200/mt means it will take that much longer for STNG to pay off the scrubber installation in the first place.

Look at the following two pages to see how the freight forward curves are pricing and you'll see that trading any of these tanker companies on the assumption they can CONTINUE to get even remotely close to the levels they were getting is fucking insanity.  Dirty freight (  [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/freight/tanker-route-td3-middle-eastern-gulf-meg-to-japan-250k-metric-tons-freight-swap-futures\_quotes\_settlements\_futures.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/freight/tanker-route-td3-middle-eastern-gulf-meg-to-japan-250k-metric-tons-freight-swap-futures_quotes_settlements_futures.html)  ) and clean freight (  [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/freight/freight-route-tc14-baltic-futures\_quotes\_settlements\_futures.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/freight/freight-route-tc14-baltic-futures_quotes_settlements_futures.html) )   You can see on both of those, the spot/front months are magnitudes higher than June or July freight rates.  

&#x200B;

I DO believe STNG and DHT are positioned well going in to COVID recovery, but if you are going to go all-in on these things it is important to understand what drove freight rates up (floating storage), why they're falling, how the freight forward curve looks, what price advantage there is for a high-scrubber fleet and how it can be a good or bad thing for a company to have such a high adoption of scrubbers.

Tesla is up just shy of 3x where they were last year. They've risen from the mid $300s at the bottom in March to $760 now. They are ""worth"" more than every other auto company combined, yada yada yada. Their CEO is clearly as much of a dip shit as he is a genius. He literally told investors to short his stock, and his cult follower numbnuts pumped the stock up today to a higher level than it was when he sent the tweet. SEC could be breathing down their neck. China tensions clearly hurt them. A lot of people think they have cash issues coming, which may be why Elon sent his tweet. But because in 100 years the electric car market could be 10x the size it is today and if they just maintained their market share they'd be making so much money that makes them worth $150B today. Using any valuation method that is grounded in logic yields them being amongst the most over-valued companies in the world.

Atlas Air, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, is a cargo airline, passenger charter airline, and aircraft lessor. AAWW is the parent company of Atlas Air and Polar Air Cargo, which together operate the world's largest fleet of Boeing freighter aircraft. 

Thoughts:

Major passenger airline services are going down bigly recently, more panic selling coming in today as big boy Buffet said he's sold all airline positions. However, the KEYWORD here is ""Cargo airline"". Ever since the beer virus started the cargo airlines were running non stop 34/7 to unsure the flow of the supply chain. AAWW should directly benefit from this.

Along with the big oil drop recently, cargo airline should benefit bigly as well. I can't seem to find the info on whether AAWW signed oil price hedge contracts tho. Yall are welcome to add.

TA:

Price dropped from $32.22 to $16.42 during the crash and now it's back to $32 again. Broke through an uptrend tunnel a little ago and went back down for price correction.

The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 5.37, which compares to its industry's average of 14.06. Over the last 12 months, AAWW's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.75 and as low as 2.83, with a median of 5.35.

Earnings:

Historically reported very strong numbers during Q1 and Q4. Beat 4/4 earnings in 2018, 2/4 earnings in 2019.

The estimate for this Q1 is a complete joke, $0.02. AAWW would have a really nice surprise. Although there's a lot uncertainty ahead, with the unique positioning in the market, AAWW would either offer no guidance or positive guidance.

Conclusion:

AAWW is well positioned during this pandemic, with everything showing positive indicators for the recent future of this company.

Excerpt:

>Every year for the last decade, I’ve sat  onstage at this meeting in Omaha with Mr. Buffett and his best friend,  Charlie Munger, as one of several journalists asking him questions sent  in by the public. His positivity, even during difficult economic  moments, always radiated with a clear sense of certainty. After all, he  is known as the Oracle of Omaha.  

>That’s why it was unsettling to hear him  repeatedly say “I don’t know.” He was careful to say the markets would  improve in the long term — though his time frame for certainty was  decades, not months or not even necessarily years from now. About the  current climate, he said, “You can bet on America, but you kind of have  to be careful about how you bet.” He added “simply because markets can  do anything.”  

>At a time when the stock market has been  buoyed by politicians pushing to reopen America and hopeful investors  often willing to overlook the immediate economic carnage, Mr. Buffett  sounded a note of realism about the challenges ahead.  

>He talked about the possibility of a  second wave of coronavirus infections. He acknowledged that the world  might profoundly change for years to come. And he spent a notable  portion of the meeting detailing the economy’s performance since 1789,  with a particular focus on the years between 1929 and 1951, a period in  which the stock market took 22 years to get back to its highs.  

>More than his words, he spoke with his  wallet. He usually relishes a down stock market to take advantage of  lower prices. Not this time. He hadn’t made any purchases recently; he  didn’t buy up stocks when they had fallen last month during what felt  like a mini-panic: “We have not done anything, because we don’t see  anything that attractive to do.”  

>Juxtapose that with his actions in the midst of the financial crisis of 2008. Back then, he wrote an [op-ed in The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html)  a month after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy: “In the near term,  unemployment will rise, business activity will falter and headlines will  continue to be scary. So … I’ve been buying American stocks.”  

>This time, he is husbanding his capital. “Our position will be to stay a Fort Knox,” he said.  

>In other words, he is hoping to protect the company if things get worse, and he is clearly worried enough that it might.  

>He said the $137 billion he had on hand “isn’t all that huge when you think about worst-case possibilities.”

AAL for this friday looking really aggressive, that is to be expected though since Buffet pooed on them and all airlines over the weekend. The IV is really high especially for friday, but that's not stopping the orders from coming in on and above the ask in sweep/block trades.

Disney has modest bearish orders, for the 15th. I see these having more potential as it gives more time than AAL and not too much OTM.

ServiceNow calls, unsure what that is but seeing calls with OTM aggression for this and next week needing a big move.

Also all these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the OI so it's most likely not closing positions.  Either buy to open orders or sell to open orders and  based on the aggressiveness of the orders one can infer its buy to open.  Some of these may be hedges and some most likely not.

comparing 3/2019 to 3/2020, a 2 % reduction in ""Occupancy of operating properties -North America"", result in half year in weighted average remaining lease. The commercial lease usually are 10-20 years. If the loss of occupancy is due to not renewing lease or signing new lease with less term, the total percentage loss in weighted lease term shall  be much smaller. So the only reason is that they have new spaces unoccupied. The RSF increase from 25.3Million sqft to 30.9 sqft. so the not rented spaces , which will bring extra burden down the road.

the average rent is 51 dollar per sqft, times total RSF and occupancy rate, divde by 4 to get income of each quarter,  which will give them over $51\*30.9Million sqft \* 95% =1.3 billion a year. Seems consistent with other numbers presented.

At 3/2019 the stock is at 142, now it is at 150, with 20% increased space and 8% reduction in weighted lease term. the rate increase on existing tenants is 46%. Are they trying to present better financials by raising rent on existing tenants? because they have trouble to secure new tenants?

Please help me with the points that I missed.

while the average home sold for $317,155 — a loss of $1,512 with each sale. And that's before accounting for interest expenses and holding costs, which amounted to an additional $4,895 in losses per home.

We’ve since seen these stocks appreciate considerably. 

I again [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g2zhb0/taking_stock_of_tanker_stocks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) about tanker stocks again two weeks ago encouraging many of you to hold these stocks for longer than your usual holding period of two minutes. Many of you couldn’t resist the urge to take profit in advance of earnings. 

That was a mistake. 

Earnings is the catalyst that will drive these companies higher. It’s when management will reveal not only the extent to which they’ve already captured outsized profits on elevated day rates but also when they will guide the market on 2Q and 3Q earnings based on the date rates they’re currently contracted on. I happen to have access to that data, and those contracts happen to be at very high rates. In short, street estimates of earnings are still way too low. 

In my last post I made it clear that street analysts have been too conservative in raising their earnings estimates on tanker stocks. Finally today we have Jefferies analyst raising his PTs and estimates across every tanker stock in his coverage. Just before earnings, of course.

DHT PT raised from $8 to $9, 2020 EPS raised from $2.20 to $2.89.

EURN PT raised from $13 to $15, 2020 EPs raised from $2.66 to $3.89.

FRO PT raised from $10 to $12, 2020 EPS raised from $2.82 to $3.87

TNP PT raised from $5 to $5.50, 2020 EPS raised from $1.50 to $2.13

STNG PT raised from $30 to $32, 2020 EPS raised from $6.04 to $10.59.

My plan is to hold through 2Q earnings release, but I do expect this week to be a major week for tankers with multiple names reporting. Specifically, on the calendar this week we got DHT releasing tomorrow (5/5), then STNG (5/6) and EURN (5/7). Should be wild.

Once upon a time (roughly 2010) nat gas was worth something. Then the shale revolution happened and the stuff went from value added to single-handedly keeping Al Gore from becoming homeless. Because production product from frack wells is light sweet crude, the product mix they produce is relatively high in nat gas and nat gas liquids when compared to more traditional E&P projects. The results of US oil production going hyperbolic is the generation of nat gas byproducts at such a rate that oil producers sometimes resort to flaring the excess due to a lack of alternatives.

This nat gas oversupply as a result of high oil demand has meant that, for the last 4 years, nat gas has hovered around breakeven prices for most producers. This has resulted in Henry Hub spot nat gas prices printing the lowest tick reading since electronic records have been kept of such things. Energy speculators have piled into nat gas futures short as a means to harvest premium from the relatively steep contango that the NG contract exhibits. While CL futures contracts have a reputation for being some of the most net long futures traded, NG futures have the inverse reputation. In recent history, NG contracts have been perpetually significantly net short. The few times in the last decade where this became untrue saw Biblical levels of short squeeze.

There are multiple inputs that can begin the cascade of short covering in nat gas, but the important variable in this instance is the historic bull route in CL futures that occurred in April. Nat gas lags crude moves but eventually nat gas will move inversely in a similar manner to the way crude moved: catastrophically.

The most obvious take is to hodl UNG shares to glory, but for those of us that understand futures and aren’t into findom or being a money manager’s pay pig, the contango rate in NG futures makes this solution undesirable. The alternative is to take up a position in a producer that is well positioned to capitalize on the inversion in the energy market that will occur once the nat gas market positioning rolls over (which is already starting)

 [https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-natural-gas-speculative-positions-1820](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-natural-gas-speculative-positions-1820)

Moves in stocks are leading indicators as they are populated entirely by speculators and not by participants looking to hedge risk as in the commodities market. Participants in the energy market have already begun to shift their holdings, selling off highly leveraged, crude-dependent producers (OXY \*cough\*cough\*) and rotating into “dry well” producers which produce a much higher fraction of nat gas and nat gas liquids. The poster children for these types of wells are E&P companies in the West Virginia Marcellus shale fields 

 [https://geology.com/articles/marcellus-shale.shtml](https://geology.com/articles/marcellus-shale.shtml)

). Companies that produce in this region include COG, SWN, CHK, RRC, EQT, and a smattering of other E&P names. CHK…. well what can I say about CHK that hasn’t already been said. EQT and COG are decent companies but have less correlation to nat gas prices and therefore are suboptimal for playing the nat gas shorts’ position implosion. SWN and RRC are the two most sensitive companies to nat gas prices. Because RRC is more leveraged than SWN, the fulcrum on which the share price balances upon is much more sensitive to the performance of nat gas futures.

This can be witnessed in the 5 year range of the stock. Though RRC is arguably less profitable than its counterparts, it exhibits a fairly secure debt structure and maintains avenues to secure additional working capital if the need for short term liquidity arises (looking at you CHK). Technical analysis of both the RRC and NG continuous contract charts also point to a sympathy breakout developing in the next several weeks in both assets.

RRC has recently broken above it’s intermediate-term range and is now holding at the bottom of a low volume range that RRC swiftly traded through on the way down.

 [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RRC?ltr=1](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RRC?ltr=1)

 Resistance from where the tick is currently to higher prices is relatively miniscule. Charting suggests that it is attempting to move back to test its previous high volume range from $9-12.

This represents a 50-100% upside in the stock that will print rapidly once the stock begins moving. The impending volatility in the stock will be the product of two things: the unwinding of the short side of the NG futures market and the pairs trade that it will provide, and the astronomically high short float/ratio that the stock currently has the pleasure of experiencing

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RRC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RRC)

 With few technical sell signals above us, when this event kicks off, pairs traders and shorts will likely rush into the bid side of the market, only to find that the order book has become too thin to accommodate them.

Reasons:

Tyson, Purdue, and other poultry suppliers are currently going through waves of plant shutdowns. commercial buyers are starting to report shortages.

Commercial shortages will lead to margin disruption if the issue persists. Will it continue long enough to cause an economic impact to the business? Id wager yes.

Basically, the idea is to buy badly OTM put and call options for some stock that's expiring after earnings and then sell it just before earnings to the good folks of /r/wallstreetbets with the idea that the demand for OTM options just before earnings makes up for the theta decay while you're waiting for IV to go up. By buying a penny option, you can't really get roasted by theta, and any movement of the underlying is just a bonus by making one of the options more valuable while the other was already worthless.

\-----------------

People are talking about how the, and notice the quotes ""Airline"" industry is failing and that it may take awhile for the ""airline"" industry to come back to grips. Some say many companies like American airlines are flat or dying, and betting on the ""airline"" industry, including Boeing, is likely a poor decision. Also something about a guy named Buffet, a guy who most of his early dealings were/would be illegal now, along with insider trading, sold his stocks so we should follow him on Boeing because it's part of the ""airline"" industry.

Selling Boeing, I hate to say it, is possibly the stupidest bet you could possibly make and you may be better off, assuming that you actually sold or put in ""long-term"" puts, *deleting and resigning your brokerage account.*

**NEWSFLASH:** Boeing ***is not an ""airline"" company***, it has planes and participates in that market but it itself is not an ""airline"" industry company.

Boeing is a **DEFENCE CONTRACTOR**. It's in the Arms/Military/Defence Vehicle sector, it's not Jetblue, **stop thinking that Boeing is some random company that flies some people on plane to disneyworld and that's it.**

Boeing makes ***military equipment, weapon ships, fighter jets, helicopters, missiles, vehicle gun attachments for cars and other motors, material for military aircraft, subs, and tanks, shot containers to hold bullets etc. etc.***

Something like Trump (awhile ago) having planes and aircraft carriers along with marine and navy ships, hanging around the korean waters to intimidate North Korea (but not attack) brought in ***bank to Boeing and other contractors.***

NOW? We are in a situation where multiple countries are buying up weapons and material. Some are scared about the future, some are in bad economic and weekended military state due to the economic consequences of the shutdown, and some just want to beef up their wares. Even the US is currently bumping up National guard equipment and preparing in case of a proxy, or direct skirmish with multiple countries, ***now including the Chinese.***

If your rationale for abandoning or betting against Boeing is because the ""airlines"" are in trouble and people ""aren't flying planes to disneyworld or to other countries on vacation anytime soon"" then your priorities are completely off the radar.

**Boeing is about to make a shit ton of money not long from now** and you are going to be missing out. It's one of the reasons why Boeing didn't take a bailout, and if that backfires the government will still bail them out anyway because they are basically the ""air"" focused variation of Lockheed or Raytheon.

**DISCLAIMER: This is an earnings play, there is always a risk of us or the institution getting it wrong. Enter at your own risk.**

&#x200B;

TL,DR: Title you dipshit

&#x200B;

**Company Overview**

NYT, or New York Times, is a paper and web-based news service, and like all news publications have been heavily covering the COVID-19 crisis. NYT has its earnings later today, and we've spotted some unusual activity surrounding the 31p.

**Options Activity**

Today throughout the day we've seen massive sweep orders bought at the bid on the May 15th expiry 31 puts, the three largest orders being 2702, 1183, and 1374, all with aggressive purchase prices. Option volume as of 8:45 is near 11k, representing over 50% of the average daily traded volume of NYT. The large sweeps themselves are valued at over 4 million dollars in premiums paid, and our in house industry veteran has informed us this does seem like a directional play rather than a hedge for earnings due to the extremely expensive premium paid (>2% of underlying).

As you read this more sweeps are coming in gradually.

**Thesis**

It seems like the big boys know that NYT may not beat earnings expectations. Because of the COVID crisis most people expect news outlets to perform well, so the proper contrarian move here would be to initiate short positions. We also saw large selling action throughout the day as well, perhaps the big boys unloading their positions.

**Risks:**

There is always the risk that this could be an IV momentum play, where the institutions pump up the action on the option then dump once volume picks up. Judging by the lot sizes, order flow, and fundamentals however, this seems more and more like an earnings bet.

&#x200B;

Of note: Seems like some of the largest orders were bought at .89 when Ask was .85. Very aggressive buying action

12:36: We're dumping with big volume ladies and gents

&#x200B;

6:40 AM PST: Q2 guidance was absolute dogshit, that IV crush was insane though, perhaps ITM puts would've been a more prudent choice for next time. The problem is institutions weren't providing selling pressure, so although we had the price action in our favor for the first 3 minutes, there was no momentum behind it.

NYT is green today with earnings tomorrow, [a massive put play was just placed](https://imgur.com/a/VMzQV9w), 8,243 contracts placed ABOVE ASK meaning it was a purchase. This is very heavy movement with a short expiration, seemingly some institution knows something we don't about earnings. I'm not gonna make a long DD post about the new york times because everyone knows it's a shit company slowly losing its stake to new forms of media. NYT is up 10% on the month.

EDIT: I'm getting some posts saying that this could just be a hedge, while this is always possible it seems unlikely as it was bought above ask and in such substantial volume. In terms of an option hedge [here is the total options volume for NYT](https://imgur.com/a/lRZyi38) the stock is very bearish at about 34:1 P/C. Unusual options activity is about finding sentiment and then doing your own research, can this go tits up? Absolutely.

2032,DD,Peloton earnings (190% IV) (6 figure invested),48,gdzjau,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdzjau/peloton_earnings_190_iv_6_figure_invested/,135,1588720374.0,"Yesterday a post about PTON caught my attention. It was by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Big_Short_2020), a new account that had lost money on Blue Apron and zero previous winning trades. Naturally I was intrigued. He is going long with over 50k in calls into Peloton's earnings call on May 6th. IV is nuts at 190% for options due May 8th. The stock is up 19.7% in the past week. He owns one of their bikes, so you already know he is biased and brainwashed. Peloton is just like a cult. Beckies and sissies paying to ride an overpriced stationary bike. Never go against a cult stock, a lesson Tesla shorts forgot about. So I had to match his retardedness by going long 53k [https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm](https://imgur.com/a/my7JJXm) . We will see if our cumulative 6 figure investment pays off. The following is the copy past of the his position and following that the DD he posted:

  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding\_over\_50k\_of\_pton\_calls\_ahead\_of\_earnings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdj3zw/holding_over_50k_of_pton_calls_ahead_of_earnings/) 

Peloton is growing rapidly - app downloads have grown tenfold. Their stock popped 5 percent when they announced that they had their largest live class (23,000 riders) over a week ago. Their previous largest live class was 19k the day after Thanksgiving.

FYI - I just did a live class and there were 29k riders present; this is 20 percent higher than their previous record which again caused their stock to surge when announced - Pton chose not to announce this. Why? I’m not sure, maybe saving the good news for earnings?

Im also bullish after calling the peloton delivery man who set up my peloton in February. During the phone call I had with him in late March, he said that they are 3x busier than the Christmas season and that he’s never seen demand like this during the two years he’s been with peloton. Though anecdotal, this tells me the lead time (in my area at least) is caused by the unprecedented demand for the bike. Demand during spring is huge because typically this is Peloton’s offseason. If they have christmas like demand for all of 2020, they will destroy their revenue guidance. Let’s also not forget that peloton lowered their revenue guidance during their last earnings call on Feb 5th before this pandemic hit. They will absolutely crush this lowered guidance, that would have never been lowered if they knew Mother Nature was going to give them the most ideal pandemic for their business model.

Lastly PTON CEO John Foley said in 2018 that if peloton wanted to turn a profit, they could do so tomorrow. The reason they don’t is because they want to aggressively capture market share which is why they spent nearly all their profit on commercials. Notice anything lately? Peloton hasn’t been airing commercials because there is no need with demand outstripping Manufactuing. This cut in add spending, coupled with unprecedented demand will allow them to reach profitably much sooner - if they announce that they expect to be profitable in 2021 - two years earlier than planned - than this stock will fucking soar.

&#x200B;

 

A lot of people see the treadmill cancellation as a negative but I’ll argue it is a positive for two reasons:

1) it is a lot larger and bulkier than the bikes. One treadmill takes the space of two bikes. Also the tread is a lot more time consuming to set up - even though Pton isn’t stepping inside their customers houses, they still set up the equipment outside. Bikes only allow for a greater amount of deliveries at a more efficient rate per delivery.

2) Pton has better margins on their bikes versus their treads.

&#x200B;

TDLR: Pton lowered revenue guidance in February - before the pandemic hit. If they had 20/20 vision they would have raised their guidance. Cuts in add spending, coupled with high demand will allow Pton to reach profitability MUCH sooner than originally believed. Their live rider class counts have grown over 20 percent WITHIN THE PAST WEEK. The cancellation of Pton treadmills allow for more deliveries and better margins. The guy who set up my Pton (I live in metro Detroit) told me that demand is Christmas x3 right now which tells me the long lead time is more likely caused by the spike in demand, rather than supply chain issues.",2020-05-05 19:12:54,0.9886,0.0,0.10425030303030307,0.3642834343434344

# Part 1 JNJ Vaccine

JnJ is developing one of the best vaccines for COVID-19.

[Vaccine](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-a-lead-vaccine-candidate-for-covid-19-landmark-new-partnership-with-u-s-department-of-health-human-services-and-commitment-to-supply-one-billion-vaccines-worldwide-for-emergency-pandemic-use)

# Part 2 ARWR & JnJ deal

When this deal was made it was for Janssen to receive a license on ARWR’s HBV drug that is in clinical trials. This deal also had another part which is that JNJ has the option to collaborate on up to 3 more targets. JnJ has already seen all the HBV data and knows how effective ARWR’s TRiM platform is.

[The Deal](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/news-releases/news-release-details/arrowhead-enters-37-billion-license-and-collaboration-agreements)

# Part 3 Pulling it all together

Today a new presentation was announced titled “Can we target coronavirus RNA with siRNA drugs?” The answer to this is YES and ALNY has already shown that RNAi can target COVID-19. Now what is ARWR doing at a discussion around Coronavirus? If they are doing nothing with Coronavirus then why are they invited and why even talk about it? The answer is they are working on it, likely with a partner and it will be the wild card revealed during the conference call.

[The Presentation](https://pharmaphorum.com/events/can-we-target-coronavirus-rna-with-sirna-drugs/)

The announcement is most likely going to be this Thursday 5/7 during $ARWR’s conference call.

ATVI 66c 5/8 (reporting tomorrow after close)

CVNA 89c 5/8 (reporting Wednesday after close) I read their 10k for 2019 and it was damn impressive. I think Jan, Feb were good to them and i think because of their business model they don't see as big of an affect as companies think.

Pinterest 25c 5/8 (reporting tomorrow after close) Had a great year last year in terms of DAU. You know how much stonks love DAU. After what i saw last week, i think the combination of increased engagement and Pinterest finally learning how to monetize their platforms plays well for them going into earnings.

I get it ZM is overvalued as fuck. 

But what I don’t think some of you retards understand is that it has ALWAYS been insanely overvalued. 

Before covid the stock was trading at 75$ and literally fucking no one was using it. 

Now the entire world is on ZOOM and it’s become a household name. I’m honestly surprised the stock is only up ~90%. 

Do you really think the market is going to realize this overvaluation fucking NOW?",2020-05-05 12:25:03,-0.2716,-0.9993,-0.0506304761904762,-0.4405101587301587

Warzone is the best COD game since Black Ops 2. Even young kids are moving away from Fortnite and playing Warzone. Sales are gonna be through the roof due to Coronavirus lock downs and stay at home orders. ATVI will open tomorrow between $67.50- $71. It will then shoot up to $77 after earnings.

As an investor having a banner year with over 300% returns on the market I'm pulling out of any and all Exchange Traded Funds now and for the indefinite future.  

**I'll say it first... The Economy is not the Market.**   

However, Sales are the Economy, Revenue is the Economy, and Gross Profit is the Economy.   And the Economy is completely disconnected from the Market.  

I have only observed this level of disconnect once before under .BOMB.  A separate era not applicable despite the similarities in false metrics to determine equity value.  In 1999 Userbase determined value instead of Revenues and in 2020 it's Future Returns at some unknown date standing in for Revenues.  .BOMB was limited to a sector, this is an era of financial delusion impacting any major publicly traded company.  

The Drumbeating response to the miracle recovery is that Treasury and Central Bank intervention has saved us from COVID... However, COVID by itself was simply exposing an economy where Stonks only go up and this has emboldened Federal intervention to no longer conceal themselves behind lobbyists and legislation.  That intervention has included drug commercials by the President and the removal of legal liability for meat processing plants.  Federal intervention and Oprah inspired bailouts are the new name of the game.

And that game has little appeal to some investors,  Buffet is sitting on the sidelines saying there are no attractive buys while he sells assets deemed too risky at P/E's below 10.

The risk to us D.D. investors is that it's far too easy for the Fed to insert money directly into the market through the special relationships between Blackrock Capital and MSCI.   

**If Blackrock is indeed buying calls on the US Treasury's behalf prior to purchasing the underlying ETF assets and then selling those calls, buying puts and then selling the underlying ETF they have created a nearly risk free arrangement to drive up and down Markets across the globe while making a profit.**   \*\*\*Now I've said it, I've made my peace... think it through, shudder, cry, piss yourself... Whatever... just don't buy the major ETF's.

The likelihood of retesting SPY300 this week is extremely high.  I'd put it at 75%.  Of course the decoupling of revenues from stock prices makes D.D. on a SPY300 likelihood akin to betting on Boxing.  SPY293 5/8 if you must get a fix for your gambling habit.

**How then do we as investors make money when D.D. on revenue, growth, and management decisions no longer significantly factor into stock price?**  

Looking at languishing consumer demand, record unemployment, increased personal debt and lack of real wage increased along with uncertainty about Covid the market in any historical context should be a cratered world. (And maybe sanity will return with a market correction, but I personally fully doubt that given recent market fluctuations including today).   

Steps I'm taking to make Money - 

1) **Buy Gold -** Long term this will backfire but the price of gold is rising as both inflation protection and as the only asset coupled to actual demand.  I'm personally in NEM with options no longer than 30 days at a time.  Selling when I get to 100% increase and then moving to the next 30 day window while taking my original investment off the table.   \*Note Gold will backfire at some point this summer when people begin to sell it to protect their other significantly devalued assets.

2) **Buy Cheap** \- I refuse to look at any company trading higher than a P/E of 8 and a Debt to Equity of greater than 150%.  Ideally I'm looking at companies where their current Market Cap is 1/3rd of their Revenues.  CCL, PLAY, HAL I've made money on these dogs after the market crushed them, just remember to sell on the recovery.  Don't be greedy pigs.

3) **Buy Essential -** The Company must be an essential service or support an essential service without an easy substitute.  Air travel for instance will be essential... and DAL is the only one I'm touching right now.

4) **Buy on Bad News -** If you insist on being a short term investor moving back into cash after profits... then purchase after bad news on the market.  Telsa was an easy one... I waited a minute after the ELON Shock, bought shares... and then sold for a quick 5%.  

These are the rules I'm working under... I can't simply be unhappy that the market is irrational, I'd like to keep making record returns.  I will note that currently real estate is looking more and more attractive but that market won't be viable for deep discounts for another 6 months minimum and given historical precedent that's more likely to be 18 months away.  All my capital gains right now are being set aside to take advantage of that beating.

**TLDR:  NEM June 5th $65C, DAL June 12th $25C  Sell both within the next week on gains above 20% and roll forward to your next opportunity.**

Goldman is the first US financial source to say >10% annual contraction.  

Math for Autists:
Q1 -4.8%
Q2 -32% 
Q3 +16%
Q4 +13%

If you believe all that, 1 * 0.952 * 0.68 * 1.16 * 1.13 = ~0.85 meaning a 15% gdp contraction

It’s like people don’t understand math, c’mon Autists you are better than that!


If you annualize it in terms of impact, you get:

Q1 -4.8% / 4 = -1.2% annualized
Q2 -32% / 4 = - 8% annualized on a 98.8% basis == 9% annualized
Q3 +16% / 4 = +4% annualized on a 91% basis == 94.6%
Q4 +13% / 4 = +3.25% annualized  on a 94.6% basis = 97.67%

Meaning a net from base of -1.2 + -8 + 4 +3.25 = -1.95% downturn - this is bullshit, look outside, we are pushing 16-20% unemployment of the U.S. full-time workforce, so don’t annualize.  Thus >10% impact.",2020-05-05 09:35:30,-0.3802,0.0,-0.749146875,-0.3764489583333333
2052,DD,I strongly recommend that you not cuck yourself by betting against Zillow $Z $ZG,112,gdrva8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdrva8/i_strongly_recommend_that_you_not_cuck_yourself/,171,1588685364.0,"**OK you autistic fucks, let's gather around and hash this Zillow bullshit out once and for all.**  I have been employed as a data scientist at Zillow in Seattle for several years (and still am currently)...using an old throwaway here for obvious reasons.  We're gonna start with why Zillow got into iBuying, bounce off why neither iBuying nor Corona is not even going to come CLOSE to killing us, and finish with why you should probably buy some fucking LEAPs.

(This post is in response to some recent grade-A retard bullshit going around this sub about Zillow, namely: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdbzyn/home_sales_to_fall_up_to_60/ and https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gdkvqf/dd_from_5254_zillow_next_leg_down_oil_reminder/)

**WHY ZILLOW OFFERS**

Everybody wants to be so quick to act as smart as fucking Jim Cramer and bash us for getting into iBuying a few years ago.  ""Oh you are a media company, why are you trying to fuck with physical assets.""  Anyone who said this is a moron who was not capable at seeing the writing on the wall regarding our ""media"" business.  In short, it was plateauing, and we knew it.  There is a hard ceiling for what agents are willing to pay for a lead, and when you multiply how many ""online"" agents there are by how many transactions they do per year, a fucking 6 year old could calculate what our topline revenue was going to cap out at.  We did that calculation about 4 fucking years ago, and we were like ""hey maybe we should do something else before our growth fucking goes to zero and everyone gives up on us as a tech company"".  **In this scenario, iBuying is a natural evolutionary step for us to open up revenue growth.**

Importantly, it gives us access to a revenue stream up the experience and competency curve for home buyers.  The vast majority of our ad revenue comes from connecting first-time home buyers to the first agent they have ever worked with.  Once they develop that relationship, they are highly likely to use that agent again without us being able to trim another slice of revenue off.  So we needed to get access to repeat buyers, and through the selling process is the best way.  I will come back to how this is important later, but having something on your website to engage with repeat buyers is the key here to unlocking Zillow 2.0.


**WHY THE CORONA SHUTDOWN AND FALLING HOME VALUES OF ZO-OWNED HOMES IS NOT GOING TO KILL US**

**ZO is financially engineered to be impossible to kill our parent company (Zillow Group)**.  I know /u/amped242424, /u/Matth3wlim, and /u/expander2 think they are the HOT SHIT for having the 3rd-grade-level ability to read the ""Total Liabilities"" line on a balance sheet, but they obviously know nothing about real financing for a competent company.  If you are having trouble wrapping your brain about how this works, why don't you fucking start by googling ""nonrecourse debt"" and come back to the table when you understand.  Basically, the loans that we took out for these properties are contained inside special-purpose financing vehicles that are tied ONLY to the underlying homes.  If we wake up tomorrow and decided that holding all these properties was going to fuck us, we could walk away from every single home we own and tell our creditors to shove those houses up their collective assholes.  These facilities were designed this way ON FUCKING PURPOSE FOR EXACTLY THIS KIND OF FUCKING DOOMSDAY SCENARIO because we have a wicked smaht group of finance people and executives.  

We also have a gigantic pile of cash that we are sitting on, mostly from a set of financing that our previous CEO (rockstar Spencer ""S-Money"" Rascoff) got nailed down right before we put ZO into hyperdrive.  This cash came from a combination of selling new stock and new convertible bonds.  Most of you fucking autists are only capable of comprehending dumbassery like you see over at $TSLA, so you see convertible bond and you think ""well if the stock isn't >420.69 the bond holders will just demand the money back instead"" but **you would be so so so fucking wrong.**  Unlike every other death-cult-tech-company bond out there, this conversion is at OUR option, not the note holders.  So if we blow all our cash on hookers before the note comes due, we just run the Xerox machine for a couple hours and hand out some newly minted common shares.  Again, all this information is available to you if you fucking read our SEC filings and investor reports instead of just skimming the Company Statistics page on Yahoo Finance.  

So we had to pause buying ZO houses for the 'Rona...who gives a fuck?  Unlike oPenDoOr and oFFerPad, we have a cash-flow-positive media business that is continuing to hum along quite nicely in the background.  We aren't slaves to the VC cycle where if you haven't shown 100% revenue growth in 18 months, you can't raise your next round, and are fucked because you aren't cash flow positive.  (And lets be absolutely crystal clear...nobody gives a FUCK if you are profitable or not...CASH IS KING and if you are cash flow positive as a tech company then you never have to raise another round of financing ever again..........OD and OP are not cash flow postive: get shrecked assholes, and your investors with you.  Especially Keith Rabois.  Fuck that guy.)



**WHY ZO IS GOING TO TAKE Z/ZG FROM ~40/share TO THE FUCKING MOON**

I told you I would come back to why ZO is important: **for its ability to engage repeat buyers.**  So lets fucking go.  

For a home owner who wants to buy another house, selling a home FUCKING SUCKS ASS, and experienced sellers know this. ESPECIALLY when you have to sell your starter home to a first time buyer; I cannot stress enough how much of a PAIN IN THE FUCKING ASS it is to sell a house to a fucking first time home buyer.  They are LITERALLY THE FUCKING WORST PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSE, wanting everything in the world on this starter house to be spic and span.  Like, fucking learn to repaint a room, you fucking children.  Let me summarize a typical ZO customer: ""This house is worth 100k more than I paid for it...I think I would give up 20k of that to not have to deal with the WHINY ASS CHILDREN [and their shitty agents...who are always 55+ Karens with fucking Comic Sans in their email signature and who STILL haven't figured out how to use e-signature software yet, it's fucking 2020 bitch, get with it] who want to buy it.""  So we have someone who has significant motivation to sell asking us what the zero-hassle selling price is for their house.  I am sure that even among the special group of retards we have assembled here, it will not surprise you to learn than >90% of people who initially press the sell to Zillow button on our site see our renovation-adjusted lowball offer and tell us to fuck off.  HOWEVER, we have now had an opportunity (which is a parallel part of the ZO evaluation process) to have a conventional real estate agent present a comparative market analysis to this highly motivated seller, and this agent has already agreed to pay us a significant referral fee if the seller ends up listing and selling in the open market instead.  If you are not educated on the real estate industry (LOL of course you aren't you fucking retard, you are 5 paragraphs deep in some rando's post on WSB) then you don't know how much that lead is worth...so I'll tell you.  On a 200k house, an industry standard value for a consummated seller lead is ~$2k.  (We do not charge even CLOSE to this yet, b/c ZO is still under construction.)  Keep in mind that we have had to do almost NO WORK to get this lead into our funnel.  Unlike Opendoor or Offerpad or PimpMyHouseUP or whatever flashy VC-funded iBuyer is in vogue this week--who has to spend GOBS AND GOBS of money on broad spectrum media to get sellers on their site and into their funnel--Zillow has FUCKING TENS OF MILLIONS OF HOME-OWNING VISITORS A MONTH on our site already, because we have already built a monster consumer media machine.  So eventually we can pass off that seller lead WHICH WE PAID NOTHING FOR to an agent for several thousand dollars in pure "">90% gross margin like only a Software Company can do"" fashion.

But wait, what if Susan (the seller) really wants out now, and is willing to pay a fee (usually the difference nets out to 300 basis points of her home value, $400k house this is ~$12k) for a service (not having to deal with any listing shenanigans, she picks a closing date and we show up with cash) so that she move on with her life and into her new house?  Remember, these are REPEAT home BUYERS...they have to go somewhere after they sell.  Then ZO is there, with certainty and cash.  And (and this is the BIG and, the ABSOLUTE biggest of ands, the FUCKING __AND__ YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR) we are right there with ASSOCIATED HOME AND MOVING RELATED SERVICES LIKE A MORTGAGE.

DID YOU FORGET THAT ZILLOW BOUGHT A MORTGAGE COMPANY?  Of course, you fucking never knew in the first place, because you never actually read any of our SEC filings, we established that earlier.  It has definitely taken longer than we anticipated to modernize, but eventually we will be offering best-in-class incentives to use our mortgages and associated services, which will allow us to capture HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL BASIS POINTS per loan from sellers who want us to streamline the whole transaction for them.  ""Oh if I sell to ZO and use a Zillow Mortgage to buy my next house, they will give me $4k in credits to closing costs? And I never have to deal with a buyer ever? DONE.""

And we get to do all of the above without building out any significant new ad spend or marketing funnels, just by ADDING A BUTTON TO OUR WEBSITE.  I mean, the button has to WORK, for like a couple thousand people a month, but that's just an implementation detail.  ZO is going to unlock growth that is orders of magnitude larger than our current ""media business"" and allow us to get our fingers into all kinds of valuable parts of the transaction that we didn't have access to before.  


So, TL:DR: Zillow's core ad business was almost at its wits end.  Getting into iBuying was inevitable.  ZO debt is non-recourse and even crashing home prices due to the 'Rona cannot kill us.  If we don't die, we win, because we now will engulf seller leads and moving-related services in the parts of the industry that we did not have access to before.

As a Zillow Group employee, I am prohibited from trading options, or transacting our stock outside of quarterly vesting windows.  However, I do have the opportunity every year of receiving my incentive grant of Zillow shares in options instead of RSUs.  And as of this year, I am now the proud holder of what are essentially Z $48c jan'2030 options, at 3x my normal allotment of shares.  So make your own decisions, but I would not recommend betting against us.",2020-05-05 09:29:24,0.9999,0.5574,-0.10682607204116637,0.4834913093196112

**Main Findings (5/4):**

1. A total sum of **$285m** was spent on SPY Options on 4th May, of this number, **$60.5m expired on 5/4**. Todays numbers are low in comparison, these are rookie numbers.
2. Total sum of **$119m was spent on puts** and, **$167m was spent on calls.** Signifying a bullish outlook.
3. The largest bet is $21m spent on **SPY 280p that expires 5/8**, 74k contracts with a midpoint price of $2.86 per contract. Probably a bet on unemployment numbers not being priced in.
4. $60m calls bought before market closed all made some profits, these people probably e**xpected closing rally**.
5. Some pretty big **random far OTM options** were traded, I'm assuming its autistic traders from r/wsb... seriously... 150p??

**Conclusion (5/4):**

Most people are bullish short term, big pee pee bois are still bearish. Bears have been cucked by the feds.

**Main Findings (5/5):**

1. A total sum of **$290m** was spent on SPY Options on 5th May, of this number, **$144m will expire 5/6 (next day)**. Low numbers, but mad on short terms.
2. Total sum of **$217m was spent on puts** and, **$73m was spent on calls.** Signifying a strong bearish outlook, a complete reversal from yesterday. Additionally, of the $217m of puts, $198m will expire by the end of May.
3. The largest bet is $23m spent on **SPY 288p that expires on 5/6**, 83k contracts with a midpoint price of $2.8 per contract. Maybe this man is looking to buy 8.3 million shares of SPY, I would never know.
4. **BONUS**: Some huge bets were placed on VXX - $14m on VXX 43p 6/19 (ITM), $6.3m on VXX 43c 6/19 (OTM).

**Conclusion (5/5):**

A sudden 180 degree turn into bearish sentiments, i'm starting to feel that all that matters is the price point at the last 15 minutes of trade.

**Main Findings (5/6):**

1. A total sum of **$261m** was spent on SPY Options on 6th May, of this number, **$135m will expire 5/8**. Fairly low volume, seems like people don't want to trade in this market.
2. Total sum of **$175m was spent on puts** and, **$85.6m was spent on calls.** Mantaining a bearish outlook. Additionally, of the $175m of puts, **$171m puts will expire by the end of May**.
3. The largest bet is $22m spent on **SPY 285p that expires on 5/8**, 64k contracts with a midpoint price of $3.39 per contract. The guy that bought 288p at close yesterday made a significant profit.
4. A surge in purchase of long dated ITM calls, these people are betting that we are near the bottom. These calls (from 7/17 to 12/31) are collectively worth $42m and range from 262-278 .

**Conclusion (5/6):**

Bottom may be near, or the experts are wrong. Either way, scraping on the way down seems like a fairly good strategy now.

**Main Findings (5/7):**

1. A total sum of **$337m** was spent on SPY Options on 7th May, of this number, **$157m will expire 5/8**. Slight increase in volume from yesterday.
2. Total sum of **$213m was spent on puts** and, **$124m was spent on calls.** Still bearish overall.
3. The largest bet is $50m spent on **SPY 305 straddles that expire on 9/18**, 13k contracts with a midpoint price of $28.74 per put, $10.1 per call. This madlad paid a hefty price to appease the theta and vega gods. For his contract to make money, SPY has to fall outside approximately 250 to 350 range within the next few months.
4. Many straddles expiring tomorrow, people are betting on a 1-2% change in price before friday close.

**Conclusion (5/7):**

Straddles are betting that unemployment numbers will tear a hole in the market. And if it doesn't, it might as well go up.

1. A total sum of **$212m** was spent on SPY Options on 8th May. Nobody wanna hold options over the weekend i guess.
2. Total sum of **$113m was spent on puts** and, **$100m was spent on calls.**
3. The largest bet is $22m spent on **SPY 290 puts that expire 5/15**, 91k contracts with a midpoint price of $2.42 per contract. If he is right, SPY will open -2% on monday for whatever reason.
4. Some crazy bets SPY 420c 12/17/2021 @ 0.88 ea, SPY 290c 9/17/2021 @ 32.65 ea, SPY 236p 11/20 @ 8.9 ea, QQQ 220c 9/18 @ 18.36 ea.

**Conclusion (5/8):**

Seems bearish, week closed with SPY up 3% from Fed pump. Every night SPY goes up 1-1.5% and over the day it falls by 1-1.2%, so basically whoever bought calls made money from Feds. Literally free money.

2056,DD,Cel-Sci (NYSEMKT:CVM) - Phase 3 Clinical Trial YOLO,18,gez3ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gez3ra/celsci_nysemktcvm_phase_3_clinical_trial_yolo/,46,1588851378.0,"Hello my fellow brethren, today I propose to you a bet for the ages (I am long $37k options). ELI5 at the end if you don't care to read.

# The Fuck is Cel Sci? 

CEL-SCI is a small-cap market clinical-stage cancer biopharmaceutical company. It's main product (and the one it will live or die by) is Multikine, an injection meant to treat newly diagnosed advanced head and neck cancer with the goal of extending their life.

In layman's terms Multikine is a combination of small proteins that signal an immune system response. It's goal is to boost the body's immune system to seek out and destroy cancer cells before the immune system is degraded by chemotherapy and radiation.

The event-driven Phase 3 study was fully enrolled with 928 patients, and the last patient was treated in September 2016. As of May 4, 2020 the company has announced that the final event (death) needed to perform final analysis has occurred meaning we should expect results to be announced within the next 2 months (End of July, early August at the latest imo). 



# Why Indicators Point To Success 



* Trial has gone on significantly longer than expected (why does this matter? It means people are dying less than predicted which is a good thing! (can be from a number of reasons, the most likely being that Multikine is doing what this Phase 3 trial is set to look for - extending patient's lives)



* IDMC (independent data monitoring committee) responsible for reviewing study data for safety and efficacy reviewed unblinded data on April 23 and gave go ahead to allow trial to proceed. 
   * Typically, IDMC would stop trials for futility if drugs really didn’t work (seen as recently as March 2020 with the [javelin-head-and-neck-100-trial](https://www.targetedonc.com/view/javelin-head-and-neck-100-trial-discontinued-due-to-efficacy-doubts) where the trial was stopped for efficacy doubts, and Multikine's trial has gone on for 9 years)



* Their CRO, Ergomed (company in charge of running the trial) has put a large stake in this trial succeeding. 



* The CEO's net worth is tied up in CVM stock and stock options that would expire worthless if the trial fails (and stock goes to sub 1 dollar subsequently) aka hes putting his money where his mouth is



# Why This Shit Could Bomb 

We know Multikine is doing something since just as recently as a few weeks ago the IDMC allowed the trial to continue with seemingly almost all the data, but we don't know if it will be statistically significant (for example the control arm could be living longer for whatever reason, both experimental and control arms could be living longer for whatever reason, dropout rate could be high and alter results). All of these are unlikely but not zero.







**ELI5**: 9 year Phase 3 clinical trial ended Monday and we are now anticipating data readout. Reading the tea leaves appears to suggest the trial will be successful, and if so potential payout could be huge ( \~460M to 4B-6B market-cap depending on how you value it, 7-10x gain). Waiting for buyout could be even bigger (10-12B). Calls for October-December to be safe (data results likely to hit at the latest July or early August imo)

Unemployment means no traveling, means imprisonment forever, means black mirror type of life in 2020, and we are so gonna work from home and wear VR headset to communicate with friends and family. Oil is doomed, airlines are doomed, no one would drive. 

I've bought puts on hotels before. I just want to point out there won't be permanent change in behaviors with people. People have inertia. Think about how hard it is for people to admit the Earth revolves around the sun. Literally take centuries. While I admit changes come faster with the age of information. But people are warm blooded social creatures that enjoy company. Majority anyway. People are gathering out in the open in NYC right in the start of this month. Google them pics. 

For Pete's sake, people took almost 20 years to accept mass produced electric car. To this day a supersonic corncode plane had been designed but never accepted. 

The first thing that bounce back super hard is going to be travelling. People are going to fly to see their relatives in no time; and yes if you don't have autism, the majority would not even be opened to the idea of holographic projection of their friends let alone we doesn't even have that technology yet. With a supply cut overreaction compounded with a sudden surge in demand, oil price would hit ATH violently. 

Your view on forever giving up social life is simply impractical because we don't run on 0 and 1s. 

That said, I want to have a civil discussion with people who hold oil calls. How do you set this up? Like 2021 calls, or 1 short leg and 1 long leg at 6/19, 2021, or calls with selling weekly puts to recoup theta decay from flat days.

2061,DD,Update on Tankers,169,gex3ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gex3ne/update_on_tankers/,190,1588843481.0," Alright autists and retards, everybody has been losing money on tankers this last week but I have news for you: your weak hands are the only reason you are losing money on tankers.

It may be a surprise to everyone under the age of 14 that the situation the tanker industry is in has happened twice in the past decade. There is a strong correlation between the oil contango and the market price of tanker stocks.

As you can see here from Euronav's investor update in April

[https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5](https://imgur.com/UFgjZa5)

Now that I have shown that the two are related let's take a look at the contango history:

[https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76](https://imgur.com/e4Jwn76)

Let's compare that to the stock price history of say STNG, NAT, ASC, FRO, and DHT:

[https://imgur.com/iruMQGf](https://imgur.com/iruMQGf)

In 2008 and 2015 when the oil contango was at its highest (UNTIL NOW) these stocks were at 5-10 times what they are valued at now. It is important to note that the contango spike precedes the tanker stock price by about 6 months. But how is the contango rising compared to 2008? much faster and steadier ([https://imgur.com/oz4DplY](https://imgur.com/oz4DplY) ) What I am saying now is that these stocks are apollo 11 and you still have a chance to jump on the shuttle.

Looking at earnings reports from STNG and DHT we see that they nearly made as much as the entire fiscal year of 2018 IN ONE QUARTER. No link cause I'm lazy and you people need to learn to do your own DD.

So everyone knows that the spot price is for these ships is up to as much as $110,000 (or at least you should know this because its over twice the standard rate and is RIDICULOUS) but what does that mean. Looking at ASC’s earnings report (I picked this one to show because its the most clear and easy to read) we can see ""Any increase in TCE goes fully to the bottom line, with every $10,000 / day increase in TCE adding approximately $90 million in earnings and cashflow annually.""

from ASC's highlights in the earnings report: [https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC](https://imgur.com/FNXyDMC)

So lets say they only are making $20,000 more per day per ship (its much more) and lets pick a small company like ASC that has a very small fleet of 20 tankers. That's a lot of tendies.

What's the risk? U.S. tensions with the middle east could escalate and cut of transportation routes but I think this is very unlikely considering the pandemic.

Are you worried COVID will bounce back and tank the economy so you don't want to invest? If that happens oil will go down again, storage will increase again and you will be drowning in so much cocaine and hookers you'll literally die.

6-12 month calls will all be guaranteed profit at the +10-25% range. I think it could go as high as 400% in a year but I don’t know the future.

Alright I made you guys a program that will help you figure out if you should buy calls or puts on SPY. Let me explain how it works and assumptions, and I will post the code at the end of the post. I will write a TLDR, so you can go straight into it. As a **reminder** use this at your own damn risk, do your research, and do not I repeat do NOT use this as your only resource. Or YOLO? Alright, so the financial assumptions of my model are the following. SPY can go to $0 and SPY can go up to $400 in the next 2 years. Why $400? Because 400/2 = 200 and whats 200/100 = 2. The name of the subreddit is Wall St **B**ets. B is the second letter of the English Alphabet. We got the financials down. Now let's look at the data it needs. It only needs the previous closing price of SPY. Input that data, run the program, It will tell you what strike price option to buy. Keep in mind it is assuming that you are buying **WEEKLY** options. It will not work on anything longer than 5 days. This uses the assumption of the **Efficient Market Hypothesis** repeat it over and over again until thats the only thing you can think of. Specifically, it tries to exploit that **EMH** *cannot* explain certain anomalies in the market.

I feel comfortable at this stage to let you all know my earnings play. I have already executed selling the 310C 5/29 and I would feel comfortable telling people to do credit spreads even more ITM. I am considering doubling down.

My current positions - Selling:  

5/8 315/320C - 1.20 Premium 

5/29 310C - 8.44 premium. 

I have no idea how low this will go, so I am not buying puts. I will consider it though.

I feel incredibly confident that I will win on both.

As I predicted, we had a negative month over month sales data for the entire company. April Sales are a calamity due to lower foot count. I love how they over hype the e-commerce portion especially to show the grim reality that people are fucking poor now.

\-4.7% in April. Best of luck out there gentleman. This is not bullish when grocery stores are starting to see negative sales.

It has grown that way over the years because of the popularity of 401k funds. It's a hidden side effect of a societal change that has crept over the years. The stock market is our pension system. Nobody let's their pension system fail. That has a good chance to trigger a revolution. You do anything to avoid that. ANYTHING. Revolutions are bad, mkay.

So, the stock market will always get bailed out. Unfortunately, the EPIC scale of this clusterfuck is beyond what our system can handle. The government is going to suspend disbelief and try to pull off a magic trick. It's classic stage misdirection. They are attempting to do magic in real time to manipulate the people and hopefully rescue the pension system and avoid a serious revolt.

I don't think they have this one, or if they do, it's going to be very difficult to pull off. They are going to have to bail out so much and distort reality so much that our currency will probably debase, or worse. Loose reserve currency status because of our disgraceful performance during this pandemic because we are being led by a legitimately retarded person.

The consumers are being left out to dry. No soup for you. The economy runs on consumer confidence and has just been a hologram of interlocking debt. It's a mirage of money printing. Hocus pocus, we were just stimulating everything and keeping interest rates at ZERO, fucking ZERO, for a full fucking decade. No harm could ever come from that. If the stock market was not our pension system, if it was just rich people's gambling houses (how it used to be), the government would just let it fail. No sane person would jeopardize our currency bailing out a gambling house for rich people. However, that's not what the stock market is anymore. It's morphed, slowly, over the years, crept into becoming our pension system... and the flaw in this design, the bug in the code, the fallacy in this policy is the unintended consequences of linking our pension system to a gambling house for the rich.... cause it never really stopped being a gambling house. That's like marrying an abusive boyfriend because you think it will change him kind of dumb. We started dating him because he's dangerous and gets us excited (good returns). Now we're stuck in a relationship with him and it's not exactly what we thought it would be. Let's fucking marry him because it will change him kind of dumb. But we never figured it out before going full bore into this policy.

So I'm buying leap calls in gold miner stocks. Cause gold is going to skyrocket. Have faith in Trumps ability to lie and manipulate things. He doesn't have this 'in the bag'. They are pushing the printer to the limit and we're gonna see if the whole contraption leaps forward out of this thing. We're gonna shock that dead corpse with 1.21 gigawatts!

The fucker is showboating around touring the country playing Guns and Fucking Roses. He doesn't have this.  In his heart of hearts, Trump is a mediocre reality TV star with a rotten brain.  He was born rich and has bluffed and bankrupted his way to 'success'.  He doesn't have the mental capability to handle this crisis.  Dude thinks people should try injecting bleach.  He's trying to manage the perception of this crisis like how a TV show manages the perception of reality TV feeds.

2092,DD,Biotech options play - Heron Therapeutics (HRTX),10,ger6bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ger6bp/biotech_options_play_heron_therapeutics_hrtx/,28,1588823593.0,"I made this trade on April 23 and forgot to post about it, but it hasn't moved much so still plenty of time to get in. Heron Therapeutics (HRTX) is developing a drug for post-operative pain called HTX-011. HTX-011 is a patch form of 2 drugs that already have been use for a long time in bupivacaine and meloxicam. There is a strong demand for a non-opiod pain killer so the the market for this drug is huge, $1B+. Heron's prior application for approval was turned down by the FDA (in what is known as a Complete Response Letter aka CRL) in early 2019 because the FDA had concerns over the manufacturing facility for HTX-011, NOT over the safety or efficacy of the drug itself. In the interim Heron fixed whatever problem there was at the manufacturing facility and the FDA inspector gave his approval. This is from Heron's earnings report from today (May 6):

**Contract Manufacturing Site for HTX-011:** In February 2020, Heron announced that the contract manufacturing site used to manufacture HTX-011 has been *reinspected by the FDA* with no Form 483 observations issued and *with a recommendation by the FDA inspector for approval of the site.* Heron has not been informed of any other manufacturing concerns.

So, Heron resubmitted its application (NDA - New Drug Approval) to the FDA and it has a PDUFA date of June 26, 2020. This is the LATEST the FDA must give its approval or denial of the drug, but it could come even earlier. From today's earnings report:

**New Drug Application for HTX-011:** In September 2019, Heron resubmitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HTX-011, an investigational agent for the management of postoperative pain. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date is June 26, 2020.

This seems like as sure a thing in biotech for approval. Of course, nothing is 100%. But this is the closest to a slam dunk I've ever seen. Heron was trading at a high of $25 in December 2019 before all the Corona concerns. At a MINIMUM I'm expecting it to get back to trading to this price once HTX-011 is approved. For a realistic maximum I'm thinking it could get back to its July 2018 high of $37. Heron is only $15.30 today. This is how I played it on April 23:

**Buy (17) Sep 18 20 13.0c at 5.10. when HRTX was trading at $14.48**

**Buy 100 shares of HRTX as a long term investment**

I like to buy ITM options to have at least some intrinsic value. My break even is $18.10

The same option as of today (May 6) is 5.90 and the underlying share price is $15.30. Plenty of time for the stock to run once the anticipated approval comes through on June 26. I'm an MD and focus most of my time on biotech investing and I'm pretty confident in this play, but I want to emphasize again there are no sure things in biotech. The main concern is because of corona the FDA delays the PDUFA date, but I don't expect that because the only holdup was over the manufacturing facility and the FDA already reviewed the efficacy and safety of the drug in the past and had no concerns. Remeber this is only a reformulation into a patch of 2 drugs that have been in use a long time already.

2. CZR hit a 52 week high of 14.73 just days before the ChynaVirus meltdown.
3. CZR currently has 70,000,000 outstanding shorted shares with an average of 3.2 days to close. These 70 million short shares makes up approximately 450% of daily average trade volume.
4. Institutional Owners makes up more than 55% of CZR investors.
5. Ichan, Vanguard, and BlackRock all hold significant shares.
6. Anal Ratings: Moderate Buy with 3 Strong Buys & 4 Hold. 0 Sell ratings.
7. Next Earnings is 5/11/2020 which means IV shall increase.
8. Implied Volatility Percentile is a mere 17%! Pretty low. Pretty Exciting.
9. Merger. CZR to merge with El Dorado in June. CZR to receive $8.40 per share. Both Management teams say all systems are go on the merger. Explained tremendously [here.](https://pocketsense.com/happens-stock-options-one-company-bought-another-6005.html)

Casinos will be aggressive in opening back up. The scientist turned Vegas mayor and mob and stuff will see to that...right?

Motley Fool and shitty websites have started covering the merger and the bounce off the RonaVirus lows of $3.30. They've been plastering click bait articles with headlines like: [CZR Stock up 42.9% in April](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/05/why-caesars-entertainment-stock-popped-429-in-apri.aspx). There are about a half dozen websites running this **exact** same article. What does this mean? It means somebody somewhere knows something...

""but the 52 week ATH is only approx $15, a $15 call won't print"" blah blah blahYou never know, it might go higher than $15 from news, or a short squeeze. Plus, you only need czr to go from $9.40 to $11 and your $15c is 2 or 3x or something. How neat is that? That's pretty neat.

As J.Powell's money printer continues, stonks will go up. Pick ones with cheap options, the probability of good news, and stuff. Investors? Could be you!!!

1. Is there a broker/trading platform that offers enough paper money of course and FREE real-time quotes? If yes, which one? If no, alternatives?


2. What exactly is inversing? If he says to go long, buy puts and other way around? When he says „buy calls“ sell calls instead? Gonna need some clarification here for true inversing.


3. Contract sizes, strike prices and expiration?

Virtu Financial is a market-maker that unsurprisingly, relies on high-frequency trading for a lot of what they do. For those of you who don't know either of those terms, look them up on Investopedia.

High frequency trading, generally speaking, realizes considerably better profits during periods of high volatility. Like, for example, the unexpected spike in market volatility during Feb/March 2018. During those two months, Virtu jumped from about 19 to about 38, a **92% increase.** [Here's an article about it](https://qz.com/1203388/high-frequency-traders-like-virtu-financial-and-flow-traders-are-celebrating-the-return-of-market-volatility/):

[https://qz.com/1203388/high-frequency-traders-like-virtu-financial-and-flow-traders-are-celebrating-the-return-of-market-volatility/](https://qz.com/1203388/high-frequency-traders-like-virtu-financial-and-flow-traders-are-celebrating-the-return-of-market-volatility/)

Virtu made an absolute killing for a few months, but came back down to earth by August.

Fast forward to 2020. **Virtu went through something extremely similar this year in late Feb,** when the world fucking ended, jumping from 18 to 24 a share, or a change of about **29%** until mid March, when at which point it came back down to more or less where it started. It has slowly risen since, and opened today at about 25.

Virtu reports earnings tomorrow morning. There is no way they don’t beat it, and probably crush it and give completely insane guidance for the rest of the year. No matter where you stand politically, it is extremely difficult to pretend that the market won’t continue to be volatile, even if it stays up. Virtu is perfectly positioned to continue to make a killing for the rest of 2020.

Here’s the fun part. Virtu has just this week started [expanding their executive team](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtu-announces-appointments-co-presidents-113010138.html):

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtu-announces-appointments-co-presidents-113010138.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virtu-announces-appointments-co-presidents-113010138.html)

They are bringing back a CFO who left last year and making him Co-President. Why does their executive team matter? These guys are as plugged in as anyone. Exhibit A: their founder, board member, and chairman emeritus: Vincent Viola. He is a billionaire who Trump nominated to be Secretary of the Army back in 2017, but politely declined, presumably out of a desire to remain a private citizen who makes money hand over fist. He also owns an NHL team, which, hey, has nothing to do with anything, but that's fun, right? Here’s a quote from him on CNBC:

**“I am of the opinion that the marketplace is just one big opportunity right now,” Viola said. “Again, the sectors, that remains for the personal financial advisor. From my perspective, there are structural changes in the economy that are going to provide for long-term growth for more than one industry.”**

Read between the lines of a guy who Trump wanted to lead the fucking Army: This isn’t just a few volatile months, this is a new volatile normal. Virtu is a company almost perfectly designed and positioned to squeeze every fucking penny out of market conditions like this.

**MY POSITION:** I have 11 $30 6/19 calls in $Virt and later today will probably get more calls across the board for that expy.

**TLDR:** Virtu ($VIRT) is a high frequency trading company that makes tons of money during periods of high volatility, it’s also founded by a billionaire with direct ties to the Trump administration who seems pretty optimistic.

2120,Discussion,Why I hate Technical Analysis and think Technical Analysts are full of shit,357,gekz7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gekz7l/why_i_hate_technical_analysis_and_think_technical/,256,1588803948.0,"**Vague Statements**

So many technical analysts talk like the Oracle at Delphi.  ""These are interesting levels to look at"" or ""This day/week/month is going to be really pivotal!""

Umm okay?  What in the fuck does that mean?  How does any of that possibly generate any trade-able insight?  Of course, it's not meant to, its purpose is to make the person sound like a wise timeless sage.  Oh how brilliant are the technical analysts that can easily discern ""interesting"" levels!

**Weasel language**

Another favorite tool of technical analysts.  Saying what 'could' happen instead of what 'will' happen.  Write a long diatribe about how the current level **could** be either resistance **or** support.  Wait awhile until an up trend or down trend is clearly visible, then point to your useless piece of shit writing and say, ""you see?  What did I tell you!""

**Unfalsifiable claims**

This is a big one.  Any sleazy snake oil salesman worth his salt knows to make unfalsifiable claims.  Never ever talk about what **will** happen or even what is **probable**, but only what the **potential** is.  ""If things break down here, there is potential for further downside"" or ""Potentially, this could be massive support. Let's see what happens.""

On the rare occasion where technical analysts go out on a limb, they always have an excuse at the ready, such as:

* Technical analysis is about probability, nothing is 100%.
* The pattern wasn't subsequently ""confirmed"".
* There were unforseen factors.  Fuck you Fed! (When everyone and their grandma can see the continual Fed balance sheet expansion).
* Hey man, you always have to set your stops.  
* I was mistaken, it happens, but technical analysis works and look at all these (cherry picked) predictions that I (vaguely) got right!

**Survivorship Bias**

Technical analysts **love** to bring up things that they got 'correct'.  ""Hey I told you that could be support and look at the rally since!"".  When someone is selectively bringing up their past record, they almost always leave out the ones they got dead wrong.  For example, every single month, post a quarter about how you're 'skeptical' of the market, that a collapse in equity prices is 'in the cards', and then after the 27th article, when there is finally a significant decline, make sure to bring up that article from now until kingdom fucking come.  Pin that article to the top of your twitter feed or link to it on reddit.  Doesn't matter if it took you 20 accounts to get a spectacular prediction right, people will follow a 2 week old account like lemmings.  

**Analysis in Hindsight**

This by far, is imo the most annoying.  Many technical analysts, with the benefit of hindsight, like to opine about how past moves were oh so obvious well after the fact.  Whether this is done to intentionally mislead people or is the genuine expression of someone with delusional faith in magic lines can only be determined on a case by case basis, largely depending on whether or not they are selling a subscription service.  They will rarely, if ever, talk about how ""obvious"" a move **will** be but will drone on endlessly about how obvious **past** moves are.  

I will say one thing about the fucking jackasses that post on loss threads with comments like ""duhhhhh you couldn't see the future!  How stupid!"": at least they are not sleazy scam artists.",2020-05-06 18:25:48,0.936,-0.8074,-0.12573330612244898,0.0009555646258503544

The value of RST isn't its consumer language business, it's Lexia, their EdTech company (covered below).  Language has been a dying business for them and the equity isn't priced for growth in that sector. (Think “yellow cd Roms from 1995”.) That being said, consumer language is still extremely high margin and vital to brand awareness. Look at google search trends on rosetta stone with focus on Q1 activity:

 [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=rosetta%20stone&amp;amp;geo=US](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=rosetta%20stone&amp;amp;geo=US) 

And look at ""learn language online"" to show the interest in response to COVID:

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=Learn%20language%20online

In their PQ earnings calls they said ""In Q1, Consumer Language is off to strong start"". This was before COVID. See remarks in investor letter below (read whole thing). 

 [https://investors.rosettastone.com/static-files/04718fc3-8017-4cc6-91df-91f1f720b19c](https://investors.rosettastone.com/static-files/04718fc3-8017-4cc6-91df-91f1f720b19c)  

Again, the equity is not about consumer language, the value in RST is in EdTech.

RST owns Lexia, which is an EdTech company focused on K-12 literacy. It is doing really, really well even before COVID and is an award-winning SaaS business that doesn't have much competition. Quick link on Lexia accolade:

 [https://pr.rosettastone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-report-lexia-core5-reading-finds-percentage-k-3-students](https://pr.rosettastone.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-report-lexia-core5-reading-finds-percentage-k-3-students) 

Look at what just happened with CHGG. Look at GSX (Chinese SaaS EdTech) reported this morning; although it may be corrupt Chinese fraud, they reported 307% QoQ growth in users. The RST CEO is a former Goldman Banker, it's a well run company, no doubt RST has been taking advantage of this situation.

See investor letter above - RST has focused on handing out licenses to schools. This is sticky business. RST usually has an extremely quiet calendar Q1 as the school sales cycle is end of summer / early fall. So expectations are low. I expect they will crush earnings and show tons of new users across all their platforms/applications. 

Here are really good VIC articles about the business and valuation:

 [https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA\_STONE\_INC/1602994739](https://www.valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA_STONE_INC/1602994739) 

 [https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA\_STONE\_INC/1193337407](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/ROSETTA_STONE_INC/1193337407) 

TLDR: 

$RST calls. Language business will benefit from COVID. EdTech market will also benefit and is key growth engine going forward. Stock is cheap. Use limit orders on options, vol is low.

What exactly had gone wrong? After reviewing the data I went back to square one, and I remembered when I first learned about the OCRRBTT. I had made some blatant errors in my analysis and overlooked some incredibly important factors. So, I adjusted my strategy and I'm on to the next trade. 

&#x200B;

The thing that I had royally fucked up on was charting and the trend, I forgot the number one rule: INSTITUTIONS USUALLY ARE TREND FOLLOWERS. The NYT play was completely against the trend, and if I had bought calls instead we would've all had 4 baggers at least. In fact, based on Ichimoku analysis, it was a clear sign for a bullish breakout, not to mention the fat dark pool prints that occurred throughout the day. I had gotten overconfident and ignored clear signs that this trade was a hedge. Shoutout to the retards that caught my mistake in realtime. 

&#x200B;

So I decided to go back to the basics, and  I thought I would share the OG method of analyzing UOA before entering a trade. 

 

The OCRRBTT system is a way to trade unusual options with maximum confidence and minimum risk. Coined by Andrew Keene, a former prop trader on the CBOE, it stands for Open Interest, Chart, Risk, Reward, Breakeven, Time, and Target. Every trader who enters a trade based on unusual options activity should do a quick run through of the following:

**Open Interest:** Compare Volume with Open Interest. Only enter a trade if volume is significantly greater than open interest to ensure the order flow is indeed opening trades.

**Chart:** What is the trend? Bullish? Bearish? Institutions trade with the trend, so if the chart points in a different direction than the option activity, proceed with caution. For example, the SNAP play gapped up after a period of slowly rising, and the trade was profitable. Meanwhile, r/wallstreetbets all got GUH’D when we bought puts on NYT, which was against the bullish trend being established for the past few weeks. 

**Risk:** I'm skipping this section because I know you autists are willing to accept any level of max pain for even the slightest chance of profit. 

**Reward:** Make sure to understand what return you can expect to get with the trade. This will give you a realistic target to aim for and prevent diamond-handing gains into losses.

**Breakeven:** Where does this stock need to move in order for your option to either break even or be ITM at expiration? Understand how this stock usually moves and don’t enter a trade where you think the option will expire OTM. 

**Time:** What is the timeframe that you expect to be in this trade? Unusual option trades generally pan out in 1-10 trading days, although some have taken as long as 3 weeks. The chances of success fall drastically after 10 trading days and the risk begins to build up. 

**Target:** What is your target profit? What is your exit strategy? Will you lock in profit or take off half? Have a preplanned exit strategy and always take partial profit once you hit your target. 

If a trader reviews all of these rules, it is much easier to manage a position and will ensure that risks are hedged and accounted for. A good trader thinks how much they could make. A great trader knows how much he can lose. The greatest traders full yolo into eternal glory, win or lose.

# Q1 Results and Expectations

[Estimate Consensus from Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BKNG/analysis?p=BKNG)

&#x200B;

|Q1 2020|Earnings (EPS)|Revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Estimates**|||
|No of Analysts|28|27|
|Avg Estimate|**$6.10**|$2.31B|
|Low Estimate|($2.86)|$1.62B|
|High Estimate|$10.02|$2.75B|
|Year Ago EPS|$11.17|$2.84B|
|Sales Growth Est||\-18.70%|

|**Actuals**|**$3.77 Non-GAAP**|$2.30B|
||($17.01) GAAP||

It was a huge miss on Non-GAAP earnings, but they still made a profit.  About ($11.86) of that difference between Non-GAAP and GAAP EPS is due to a non-cash impairment writedown of goodwill from the KAYAK and OpenTable acquisitions.  This is important because it shows how management views the future.  I would strongly argue that most investors should take that impairment into account.

For those of you who don't know, goodwill impairment write downs generally occur when management believes that the value of an acquistion is not recoverable.   That means that management believes that the financial outlook over several years for OpenTable and KAYAK has decreased to the point where the initial acquisition price is no longer worth it.  You write down when the companies will never make the profit required to justify the acquisition price.

# [From the 10-Q](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553120000027/bkng3312010q.htm) (and described on the call):

>***Newly-booked room night reservations, excluding the impact of cancellations, have been declining as the COVID-19 pandemic has spread, and decreased by over 85% in April 2020 as compared to April 2019.*** In addition, ***we expect our revenue will be impacted to a greater extent*** considering the impact of cancellations in March for April stays and also since many hotels, especially in Europe, were not open in April. We expect to continue to see ***severely reduced new travel and restaurant reservation bookings as compared to 2019 levels for the foreseeable future***, which will have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, given the volatility in global markets and the financial difficulties faced by many of our travel service provider and restaurant partners, we have increased our provision for expected credit losses on receivables from and cash advances made to our travel service provider and restaurant partners.  
>  
>Due to the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of current conditions around the world, we are unable to predict accurately the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business going forward. We currently expect, however, that ***the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our financial performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, much more significantly than it impacted the quarter ended March 31, 2020***, primarily because an increasing number of markets and locations will have been subject to the governmental measures and economic disruptions noted above during the entirety of the second quarter (as compared to the first quarter, when the effects of the outbreak were largely limited to China and certain other Asian markets during January 2020 and much of February 2020).

***Revenue is down 85% for all of April.***  From the call, management doesn't expect May and future months to trend much better.  Q2 is going to be far worse that Q1.

**From the call, management currently expects a long, drawn out recovery for BKNG to take years.**  They do mean years in their expectations too, as you can see from how the evaluated goodwill impairment on KAYAK and OpenTable.

# Goodwill Impairment from the 10-Q

>We review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that ***the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.***  The assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, before interest and taxes, of the related asset group. Due to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed the recoverability test of our long-lived assets and concluded there was no impairment at March 31, 2020.  
>  
>We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. We test goodwill at a reporting unit level.  Our annual goodwill impairments tests are performed as of September 30. Due to the significant and negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at March 31, 2020. Under the current goodwill impairment standard adopted in the first quarter of 2020, a goodwill impairment loss is measured at the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill (see Note 1 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements).  
>  
>As of March 31, 2020, the fair value of each of our reporting units, except the OpenTable and KAYAK reporting unit, substantially exceeded its respective carrying value. For OpenTable and KAYAK, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $489 million, which is not tax-deductible, resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2020. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by a significant reduction in the forecasted near-term cash flows of OpenTable and KAYAK as well as the significant decline in comparable companies' market values as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The income approach estimates fair value utilizing long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to the cash flow projection. ***In the cash flow projection, we assume that OpenTable and KAYAK will experience a significant decline in near-term cash flows with a recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance occurring in 2023.*** The shape and timing of the recovery is a key assumption in our fair value calculation (both in the income and market approaches), however, it is highly uncertain whether the actual recovery will match the trajectory or magnitude of our assumptions. If the timing of recovery to 2019 levels of financial performance were to occur in 2022 or 2024, the impact to the estimated fair value, at March 31, 2020, ranges from an increase of over $230 million to a decrease of over $410 million.

There you have it.  Management is currently assuming key parts of their business don't recover to 2019 levels ***until 2023***.  Holy Crap!   No V-shaped recovery here.

# Balance Sheet

Glenn Fogel and team are extremely competent managers and they are definitely the right people to help BKNG weather the storm.   The team took strong actions to improve their cash position (as has previously been announced) and now has about $14B in cash and cash equivalents (from the call).

From the 8-k on April 7, 2020:

> Prior to giving effect to the Senior Notes Offering, the Convertible Notes Offering or any other external financing, and without accessing our revolving credit facility, we believe that: (a) **if our current business volumes persist indefinitely**, our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet the operational and other **needs of our business through at least the end of 2021**, and (b) **if our business volumes continue to decline**, our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet the operational and other **needs of our business until the second half of 2021**. We cannot, however, assure you that this will be the case.  

I don't see BKNG heading to bankruptcy.   They appear to have the cash to weather the storm through 2021-2022.   Management seems to believe that the storm will be much longer for them than other companies.

# tl;dr:  = Will this tank?

We will find out tomorrow.   Unlike most other earnings releases, BKNG management was fairly descriptive on how poor things look to them going forward.   Sales are down 85% for April 2020 and they don't see much improvement for May.  Q2 is going to be far worse than Q1.  Glenn Fogel, CEO of Booking Holdings, held a very dim view of financial performance **for up to years to come** on the call, only to have that view backed up by the **2023 return to 2019 performance** timetable they gave in the 10-Q.

**My question to you:   is a stock down 80-85% in revenue for Q2 (only -48.7% for Q2 was expected going into the call) with a severely depressed outlook through 2023 priced correctly at only 31% down from recent peak?**

If this tanks, it will do so justifiably.

If this doesn't tank, I see this as a new canary in the coal mine for short plays in the near term:  avoid them.

1.) [Stimulus version 3.00](https://en.as.com/en/2020/05/07/other_sports/1588852610_686223.html)

States and cities are going to go BK if there’s no funding included in the next package. McConnell doesn’t want a “blue states bail out”. Trump want to include hotels and immigrations money in the next package. Regardless of your leaning, can you imagine the repercussion if New York BK? There will be another stimulus next 3 weeks.

Not happening you say? Oil going negative proved that anything is possible. ECB (European Central bank) started this in 2014 because it has no growth. Blah blah blah blah blah……… to prevent deflation. If you have debts, deflation sucks, because bottom line, deflations = debts become more expensive. Governments like inflation; around 2%. If you are saving money, don’t expect to get any yield on your saving account. High yield saving account will become no yield saving account. Odds are mortgage rates will lower = real estate’s prices will go up. Stocks will go up in value.

# 1Q Earnings Review

* Total revenue in the first quarter was $470mm, a 47% increase from the comparable quarter in 2019; represents a \~5% beat to analyst estimates
* Subscription Solutions revenue grew 34% to $188mm
   * MRR as of March 31, 2020 was $55mm, up 25% compared with $44mm as of March 31, 2019
* Merchant Solutions revenue grew 57% to $282mm
   * GMV for the first quarter was $17.4 billion, an increase of $5.5 billion, or 46%, over the first quarter of 2019
* Operating cash flow loss of \~$85mm for the quarter (but who cares about profitability)

# Positive Highlights from a Bull's Perspective

*Selected statements from Mgmt. or Company filing*

>New stores created on the platform grew 62% between March 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020 compared to the prior six weeks, driven by the shift of commerce to online as well as by the extension of the free trial from 14 to 90 days

&#x200B;

>Strong January and February merchant sales further boosted by elevated buying in March driven by COVID of food and other essentials and items such as home office and gym equipment contributed to Q1 GMV

&#x200B;

>New types of merchants, such as food stores, are migrating to Shopify Plus

&#x200B;

>GMV growth accelerated in April compared with the first quarter of 2020

# Positive Highlights from a Bear's Perspective

*Selected statements from Mgmt. or Company filing*

>It is unclear how sustainable consumer spending levels will be in this uncertain economic 

&#x200B;

>It is unclear how many in this \[new merchant\] cohort will sustainably generate sales

&#x200B;

>March and April saw more merchants downgrade from Shopify Plus to lower-priced plans than in January and February

&#x200B;

>We anticipate a portion of this funding \[Shopify Capital\] to go toward \[merchant\] business continuity instead of growth activities

&#x200B;

>MRR growth was impacted by lighter international merchant adds; and, an uptick of subscription cancellations and merchant downgrades to lower-priced subscription plans in March

&#x200B;

>If economic growth slows further or if a recession develops, consumers may not have the financial means to make purchases from our merchants and may delay or reduce discretionary purchases

# So What Does This All Mean?

I spent a considerable amount of time trying to rationalize the recent run-up and still cannot justify these share price levels. Here are my predictions:

* MRR for the next several quarters will be flat and may even decline
   * Was $55mm as 1Q/20 compared to $54mm at the end of Q4/19
   * Company already guided to headwinds from free trials but they expect this to pick back up again in 3Q once the trial period ends
      * [How many of these stores will make it past the 90 day trial?](https://community.shopify.com/c/Feedback-On-My-Store/bd-p/ecommerce-gallery)
   * I expect users to continue to downgrade in an effort to conserve cash or outright cancel
* GMV will not stay at these elevated levels
   * A majority of the categories mentioned on the call are one-time in nature (e.g. home, fitness, entertainment, leisure and hobby products)
   * Food, beverage and tobacco product category most likely experienced a massive ramp in the first several weeks of April as buyers ""hoarded"" supplies
   * Consumer discretionary spending will become more challenging over the coming months as the reality of this ""V"" shape recovery sets in
* As expected, they just [issued a secondary](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001594805/20faef37-cde2-4aec-8b7d-8cbf2bf73c0d.pdf)
   * Should marginally put pressure on the share price near-term
* Ownership breakdown is really odd for a $85bn market cap company
   * 65% owned by institutions, 10% by insiders and 25% by the public/retail
      * CEO and a Director account for nearly all of the insider holdings
      * COO owns a *total* of 78 shares, Chief Product Officer owns a *total* of 47 shares, CTO will own *zero* shares once his Intent to Sale goes through on June-1, Chief Legal Officer owns a *total* of 1 share, etc.
   * I think the retail category can be sum up by yesterday's [Buy the Dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gerkgx/they_said_buy_the_dip/) post
      * Sort by new and look at all the users absolutely having no idea what they're looking at but wanting in

These guys have never missed on earnings. Again, I believe even a quarter of flat/to declining growth will change the perception driving the stock down. Once that happens it's a race to the bottom.

# TL;DR

I still think the fundamentals of the [original thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6pehn/shopify_a_poor_mans_amazon/) hold true. Volatile stock that has little upside given recent massive run-up but major downside risk if they miss revenue growth.

On May 6, significant, and unusual, blocks of options were traded on ERI. A deep-pocketed buyer, likely an institution, made a bullish purchase of approx. 5000 6/19 20C's at the Ask, and a sale of the same amount of 30C's near the Bid. This bullish call was despite the falling price action that day. This represents 500k shares, or approximately 5-10% of daily volume on any given day.


What makes this even more unusual is the fact that the open interest on either of those options before the purchase was less than 1000 contracts, meaning this was an incredibly large buy. Moreover, none of the other casino stocks seemed to have experienced a large bullish buy like this.


For a quick overview of ERI: Eldorado Resorts is an American hotel and casino entertainment company founded and based in Reno, Nevada that operates 23 properties across 11 U.S. states. In 2019, they entered into a merger agreement with Caesars Entertainment for $18 billion in stock and cash. The merger is expected to be completed by the start of the summer.


Because ERI had to resolve anti-trust issues with the merger, they've sold off numerous properties to buyers. Most of these sales were in late 2019. Despite these sales, the casinos are bleeding cash in this climate. In particular, the largest problem is the rent issue.


The fact that **the trade was a vertical spread**, rather than a naked option purchase, means there is still time to get in on the trade. **For the mysterious buyer to make any money, the price must go into the mid-20s over the next 2-3 weeks.** Even with the news on Nevada taking action to reopen casinos, the stock still closed at $19.38 today.


I expect a couple of potential catalysts to drive the price above $20 in the next few weeks:
- ERI successfully renegotiates its lease on some of the properties for the year
- ERI executes another favorable sale on a property, deleveraging its financial position
- ERI gets approval to reopen its Casinos before rivals do.

As always, this is just my opinion. It is obviously risky to trade hospitality / live entertainment stocks in a pandemic like this. So do your own DD before you take any action.",2020-05-08 03:39:06,0.9998,0.0,-0.09775483870967748,0.3006817204301075

Degenerates, 

Fellow autist Mark Cuban went ‘Big Short’ on the Coronovirus and hired his own army of wage slaves to survey the new post-covid opening of the Texas Economy. He says he will do follow up analystics as well. 

IMO doesnt look great, but who thought it would?

Methodology: 

We called ~1000 restaurant and retail locations based on popularity (we used # of reviews on Yelp by category as a proxy) to assess full re-open rate (open for dine-in, in-person shopping etc.) 

We conducted physical audits at ~300 locations across restaurants and retail locations in Dallas to assess compliance against state re-opening protocols 


1)Re-opening Rate: Only 36% of businesses chose to open on the opening weekend

2) Aggregate Degree of Safety Protocol Compliance – By Locations: Overall – 96% of businesses were non-compliant across all mandatory protocols and all locations. The extent of non-compliance is dramatic with ~1/3 of all locations being <50% compliant across mandatory protocols as established by the Governor’s office.

3)Aggregate Degree of Safety Protocol Compliance – By Protocols: On average, ~60% of mandatory protocols were followed and ~54% of all suggested protocols were followed. In aggregate – locations followed ~58% of all mandatory + suggested protocols. 

4)Individual Location Assessments: Overall – there is a wide discrepancy amongst individual level performance by location type. 

5) Comparative Benchmarking Assessments: We’ve done very preliminary levels of comparative analysis, but early assessments show a pattern in the data of highly variable compliance within a parent franchise. 

TLDR: Mark Cuban says the openjng is mostly for show and majority of small businesses have no idea how to operate post-covid.

Volume's at the lowest it's been in weeks. You can't maintain a rally past 2900 or a sell-off past 2800 without volume. We noticed that this week with the post-Amazon ER/tariff sell-off towards 2800 on Monday and today's low-volume surge to 2900 that got sold off into EOD. Both big movements being pulled back. 

We've been range bound 2700-2900, and more lately, 2800-2900, with recent overnight rallies and un-explained sell-offs EOD. What this could mean is that there's some market manipulation to let some big investors cash out at a higher price. They all know 2850-2900 is a very important level, going back years. 

This range has acted as a big resistance for years until we blew past it last year and it acted as support. Both bears and bulls know that they couldn't maintain a big move either way with the volume we have. Or else we would have continued to drop on Monday or continued to rally today. They've been testing the range limits all this week. 

If we surpass it with increasing volume, 3100 is easily possible with 2900 acting as support, and if we fall below it, it's going to be a fall down to 2600-2700s. 

Why tomorrow? Because tomorrow we have April's job reports. Good or bad doesn't matter, it depends on how the big bullish and bearish players can move the market tomorrow. 

Big move up? Major news sources will spin it off as the market is optimistic and that we're due for a faster recovery. Re-assuring investors and providing temptations to side-line cash holders to buy in, providing additional volume to rally past 2900. 

Big move down? Major news sources will spin it off as the economy is way worse than predicted, and panic investors into selling, providing additional selling volume to break down 2800. 

Tomorrow could also just be a flat day, but it feels like the monthly job report tomorrow is ""big news-worthy"" enough to act like a catalyst for a big move one way or the other.",2020-05-08 02:32:02,0.9997,0.0,-0.307722463768116,0.23065917874396136

As a result, Cisco stock provides an attractive dividend.     

   

Corporate spending on information technology was expected to plunge due to COVID - BUT IT HASN'T.

There's a long-term view. Cisco could go shopping once the dust settles and make the kind of big, transformational acquisition that some have been looking for.   
   


In the January quarter, Cisco's fiscal second quarter, the company paid a cash dividend of $1.5 billion and bought back $870 million of its own shares. Cisco stock had some $27 billion in cash and equivalents. In 2019, Cisco reduced debt by some $5 billion. Heading into the April quarter, Cisco had about $12 billion remaining in a stock repurchase program.     
    


In its glory days from a 1990 initial public offering through early 2000, Cisco thrived as a major supplier of the hardware to build internet networks, both to telecom firms and large companies outside that sector. Cisco stock soared more than 100,000% in that period, before the dot.com bubble burst.
     
     

More recently, after a breakout in October 2017, Cisco stock gained 70% through mid-July 2019.      
    



But CSCO stock swooned in the latter half of 2019. It plunged like most tech stocks in the coronavirus-driven market correction. The upper echelon tech stocks are providing strong bounce backs to the rest of the market. CSCO should be no different, infact - with upside for more growth than the company has seen in the last 10 years. They're more diverse in cloud computing services, software, and equipment.   
   

  


The tech industry icon is shifting away from its core business of selling network switches and routers. With acquisitions, Cisco has aimed to increase revenue from software and services.     

     
   

Before the coronavirus emergency, management has stated that 30% of all revenue would come from software in fiscal 2020, up from 22% in 2017.

entry into the COVID-19 fight & “coincidentally” followed that up by restating their “Unmatched speed in getting to the clinic.”

This is an amazing call for ARWR they announced that they're now working on all 3 JNJ targets.

Exit Strategy

This is not fully what I was expecting but was still an amazing conference call! Don't worry this is typical for ARWR after conference calls not gapping up. It normally takes 2-3 days for the big moves to start I just thought it would be different if they made the announcement which they are keeping disclosed for now.

Im holding my 5/15's into next week as there is a presentation at BofA Securities 2020 Health Care Conference on 5/14. ARWR has stated they are expecting to release data at some of these presentations so this is actually going to be a bigger catalyst.

Here is a list of the future events and catalysts:  [http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/events-and-presentations](http://ir.arrowheadpharma.com/events-and-presentations)

This is one of the most undervalued biotechs and I recommend holding your June and further options for a while. The move up is going to start here and it will look similar to before from 40-73 but much faster and higher!

Very specific, time bound trial questions showing analysts are refining model inputs to update price targets. Expect some upgrades next week and possibly even tomorrow morning!

This is the fucking typical ARWR sell off didn’t expect it after an amazing call but we’re going to recover quick from here. I just added more 5/15 $40’s expect a move soon.

Now is the time to add to June calls this is going to start moving quick from here. This is the same pattern it’s done for the past 2 years after a CC with amazing news. Takes people awhile to digest the information then buyers come in next week.

Not what I expected very disappointing looks like the timing is off and I'm gonna be rolling into August 60's trying to ride this slow wave up. This is an extremely undervalued company and I know it'll be over $100 by year end. It's very hard to time the market it's only a matter of time until we get some pivotal data that'll give us the momentum we need.

Any time catalysts: News AROCoV (Gov funding). Readouts: AMG890 LP(a), JNJ3989 (HBV), MAD AROANG3 (5 subgroups), MAD AROAPOC3 (2 subgr), dosing start AROHIF2 / AROENaC, pre clinic data muscle. SooN: 6 months biopsies AROAAT, publication ARC520/521/AROHBV/JNJ3989 Watch out.""

my take...as data drives the sp in the coming months, the sp will rise to new highs and maintain those highs more easily based on trial advancements and data readouts. a wildcard like a partnership could drive the sp as well...summer could/should be

I don't know if the options are well priced / ideally priced, but I'm not going to play that game. What I'm interested in is how likely will this stock be > $12.50 by Jan. 2022.

**100% chance it will be greater than $12.50 before 1/22.**

Where it will be at 1/22, I don't really care. If there's some semblance of profit greater than my threshold, than I'm happy. FWIW, if I see > 80% return in less than a week, that's a great place to start taking profit. If I see > 400% return in < 12 months, I'm out, until it makes sense to be in again.

**TL;DR:** SONO 1/22 @$12.50. (bought yesterday before earnings).

I'm not going to eat anything or do anything if it's a good play - because that's ridiculous.

I'm not going to eat anything or do anything if it's a bad play - because that's WSB-level ridiculous.

&#x200B;

**Addendum:** Sonos could have eaten it so many years ago. The fact is, despite the growth in Apple and Google branded smart home speakers, Sonos is still the only comprehensive sound system / product out there. It's got a VERY loyal fan base (even despite the BS sunsetting of support) and it's got a big sticky factor. Once you get one, you're very likely to keep adding to your room / cave / closet / juice factory / mega mansion.

I do believe they've been fairly treated by the market. Their Direct to Consumer approach has been pretty crappy - but that's compared to Google and Apple. This matters more than ever right now because DTC is the only real way to sell consumer goods right now. If Sonos got hit hard due to inventory issues with its big box suppliers, then so did everyone else. Compared to the big (but lower quality) players out there like Bose, Vizio, Samsung, Sonos dominates them in DTC.

We know DTC works because Amazon, Peloton, Overstock and Wayfair have been killing it. AMZN is cheating because of cloud services...but people are stuck home and they're buying stuff.

Financially, Sonos is also in a good spot. From their most recent 10-Q, they've got 283MM in unrestricted cash/liquid investments. They've got 213MM in current liabilities, so they're not in huge danger of insolvency (especially with their current inventories). If you add in their LT Debt of $21MM, they're still in good shape re: Asset / Liabilities.

All this to say ... SONO long term is a good risk / reward payoff. Feel free to YOLO if you want - but I think that's ridiculous. It's more likely that you can get 5, 100% returns over 12 months in the same stock than you can a 500% return in 1 stock in < 1 month.

Let's look at where this has already happened - today at bell, $ROKU 137c 5/8 was worth \~$5.6, and look at it now with $8.9. With nearly zero risk, you could have achieved gains in the vicinity of 100% on just buying the call at open and selling at close. It also happened with $ATVI earlier in the week, but I've not held a position until earnings date, though it still turned out to be profitable with the market reacting well to $ATVI's earnings beat.

I know what you will say now - $ATVI AND $ROKU will smash earnings one hundred percent, you're a fucking retard, go back to r/investing. You could then again look at the expected return of 100% DAILY - keeping this up for a week by selling at open and rolling over towards the next likely ticker you're looking at gains of 1600%, provided you stick with reinvesting the entriety of your original sum.

Chances are, $ROKU WILL smash earnings. But on the off-chance there's an Amazon around the corner, it would be a safer, and not a lot less profitable a bet to be making.

You might be thinking, oh well that's nbd SARS and MERS were lower population exposure so maybe there just wasn't enough incentive. But did you know that the common cold is a coronavirus? 

Not only are coronaviruses responsible for a shit ton of respiratory illnesses in humans, but basically every single kind of livestock as well (anything that is a mammal or bird at least). 

Creating a vaccine isn't as simple as ""throw money and time at it"". It's doing something that's never ever been done, and something that people have been trying to do for DECADES. I understand there is obviously a ton of incentive right now to develop one for covid-19, but this is new science and it takes a long time to make breakthroughs, let alone for regulatory processes.

Remember all of those other companies that crushed it during this time? Yeah, I do, how about $ZM? 

How do you think people are able to use zoom from their computers? WEBCAMS & HEADSETS! 

Now, what about gaming? Everyone is stuck at home playing videogames right now. Logitech is one of the premier companies of gaming peripherals with its Logitech G lineup. 

It also owns Astro Gaming, Blue Microphones, and Streamlabs, Ultimate Ears, and Jaybird. All peripheral brands that stand to make a killing in this current environment.

How about their stock? It is currently at the 10yr all-time high.

In Nov. 2008 there were 533,000 cut jobs. In April projected jobless claims will be 41 times that.

If 33 million Americans don't have income for a whole month, where are they going to get the money for rent/mortgage, utilities, basic needs, diapers, jello, porn subscriptions,   Almost 50% of Americans don't have money in there savings account while 25% have less than $1000. If they have savings, and lets say that these 75% of people have $1,000 of their own and $1,200 of Mango Man's. $2,200 to get through April, May, June, July? I fucking doubt it.

If people aren't able to spend and business can't employ workers to make a profit, closing doors or remaining suspended until further notice, how is the stock market on the rise?

The last time jobs declined, the stock market declined with it. It seems that the Bulls are jerking each other off, buying more and more because they are trying to take advantage of ""our economy was strong right before this whole thing, so I'll buy the dip.""

Sadly, it appears to be working for Tyson, but they are having issues with reopening. For example, in [Dakota City](https://siouxcityjournal.com/news/local/tyson-delays-reopening-of-dakota-city-beef-plant-to-wait-for-covid-19-test-results/article_45e0057b-6d56-50e0-8346-d5349a8bec08.html), they are delaying reopening it, and it is their biggest beef plant.

Tyson closed the Perry plant two weeks ago for cleaning and testing. They confirmed 700 cases, or [58%](https://theperrynews.com/fifty-eight-percent-of-perry-tyson-workers-test-positive/), of their employees have covid-19 a couple days ago.

I have some friends who are contractors that were quarantined for two weeks and went back to work at Perry earlier this week. One of their guys got a high fever and were sent home to get tested. Despite my friend and his crew possibly getting covid-19, they aren't sending any of the engineers or other contractors who were in contact with my friend's crew home to get tested. Hell, other contractors are starting a shit storm about not wanting to go home and finishing their work despite being exposed. (Fucking dumb)

Besides production running at a fraction of what it used to be, the plant is getting way behind on projects that have serious deadlines. All in all, some contractors who are working at the plant, even when it is shut down, will continue working despite being sick themselves.

Tyson is trying to contain the spread within their employees, but they have no real control over the contractors they have hired. I'm talking about the Perry plant having dozens and dozens of crews.

Disclaimer: I closed all of my short positions of Tyson after earnings, but I plan on re-entering a short position on the day when I find out either the Dakota City, NE; Perry, IA; or Storm Lake, IA plants close again.

TLDR: Tyson Plant in Perry, IA has 58% of their employees infected. Contractors are getting sick and are attempting to continue working, potentially spreading covid-19. No positions because the time isn't right.

Edit: Tyson is reopening the Dakota City plant, despite no longer reporting the number of employees infected with covid-19 since April 30th.

2204,DD,$SDC Tendies May Put A Smile On Your Face!,18,gfb06x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfb06x/sdc_tendies_may_put_a_smile_on_your_face/,23,1588901332.0,"TLDR and position at bottom

**The Company:**

SDC is a telehealth company primarily offering dental products like aligners (think invisalign).  There are two ways of using SDC: 1) go to a Smile Shop (several locations internationally) and see a doctor for an initial check-up and get pics of your mouth taken for a 3D model or 2) DIY traditional impression kit from home (that pink algae stuff).

Recently, Smile Shops have been closed until May 3rd due to COVID and SDC has moved to an all DIY impression kit model. (I'd actually like to see this be the primary model for the company moving forward as it reduces costs and is more aligned with the DIY trends). 

**Financial Position:** 

Currently have $350m cash on hand, only $200m in total debt outstanding. The company also has a credit facility for up to $500m from JPM.  For a growing business with international exposure, the risks that this thing is going to disappear seem unlikely and the company is healthy enough to weather this storm. 

**Traction:**

Main revenues are from financing (they offer 17% APR thru a program for paying for their product over a length of time, with the manufacturing costs due up front as deposit, so they never lose money here even with delinquency and this is damn near loan sharking, but only a minor part of total revenues) and from their aligners (which cost about 50% as much as traditional invisalign); together, gross margins are a nice \~70%. I believe SDC already had a good business model. 

Last year's net loss was about $500m. Mainly due to increasing marketing and SGA costs to achieve growth and IPO. However, these things come at the expense of gaining new customers - and most important KPI for a growth company is their increase in product shipments and revenue growth, which grew 80% last year (plus SDC already has good margins and balance sheet). Why do I think these metrics are going to look even better? 

Now, in a time where health is becoming increasingly important, people are staying at home, consumer discretionary spending is limited due to recession, I believe the DIY at home product offering, available financing programming, and cheap alternative to traditional orthopedics is very attractive. Also, EOY 2019 SDC picked up Aetna and United Health to help provide coverage, plus another recent deal which shot up the stock 10% yesterday (insurance for dental health is difficult and these partnerships will expand consumer reach further).

Additionally, Teladoc has mooned to ATH while SDC has been left behind, trading at $7.50 vs $15 pre-COVID. Yet, rigorous DD on Google Trends shows they've been about equally popular in the past 90 days ( probably not directly comparable because Teladoc likely converts more customers from searches) : [Link](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=Teladoc,Smile%20Direct%20Club) 

**The Bad:**

There exists significant media covering problems with the SDC products, but I dont think this is specific to just SDC, as there exists articles for aligners like invisalign in general. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Financial health looks like SDC will survive, has already good business model with nice margins and is growing revenue significantly, trading 50% off pre-covid high while Teladoc has mooned and I think covid issues will actually help the company's growth (DIY, cheap alternative, financing options).

2205,DD,Cisco ($CSCO) calls will print,108,gfax7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfax7l/cisco_csco_calls_will_print/,87,1588901078.0,"One of the most undervalued technology stocks at the moment: $CSCO. Zoom has been getting the lion's share of attention, but Cisco has been seeing crazy growth in usage of both its teleconferencing (Webex) and VPN (AnyConnect) software. $CSCO has a lot of room to grow -- it is still down \~28% of its 52W high.

Cisco's earning announcement is expected May 13th, and they'll beat their estimates. Here's why:

* First off, Cisco consistently beats its earning estimates. Last quarter's report [delivered an EPS surprise of 3.7%.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-cisco-csco-2020-05-01)
* In February, when East Asia was being hit the hardest, Cisco saw [22 times the amount of network traffic per second it normally gets for its Webex service from users in China](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/cisco-webex-sees-record-usage-during-coronavirus-expansion-like-zoom.html)
* Webex saw incredible growth in March, too, with registered attendees and hosted meeting minutes more than doubling to [324 million](https://blogs.cisco.com/news/easing-the-everyday-challenges-of-sheltering-in-place) and [14 billion](https://blogs.cisco.com/news/connected-and-secure-webex-in-todays-world), respectively. If even a fraction of that growth continued in April...
* Okta, the enterprise SSO provider, indicates that March's number of unique users of Cisco's VPN software [peaked at 238% when compared to 28 days prior.](https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2020/work-from-home)

All of this leads me to believe that estimates are quite low, and we'll see a pump before and following the announcement.

On April 28th, Mondelez ($MDLZ), the company that owns Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, etc., reported earnings. In the earnings call, they said ""In the US. our biscuit brands, Oreo, belVita, Ritz, Triscuit and Wheat Thins all posted mid-teens growth or more in the first quarter...We also saw strong momentum in our categories, especially in Biscuits and Chocolate, but less so in Gum and Candy.""

This bodes well for Hostess whose exposure is mostly in North America.

Furthermore, Mondelez's CEO said “Originally, you would have said this was pantry loading, but this has now been going on for more than six weeks. And unless consumers are building a warehouse for Oreos at home, I think they are eating it,” on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”

Although the growth in sales, Mondelez stock did not move up on earnings. However, this is mostly due to their international, emerging markets, exposure and ""due to mark-to-market losses from derivatives""[""due to mark-to-market losses from derivatives""](https://ir.mondelezinternational.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mondelez-international-reports-q1-2020-results) according to their [earnings report.](https://ir.mondelezinternational.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mondelez-international-reports-q1-2020-results)

SmileDirectClub has [it's earnings](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/sdc) on May 13th. I'm telling you a week early so you guys can profit off the run up. The stock is currently at 7.48, I expect above 8 the day before earnings and above 9 after.

**What is SDC?**

SmileDirectClub (SDC) is an oral care company and creator of the first direct-to-consumer medtech platform for teeth straightening. They are currently attempting to revolutionizing the oral care industry with cutting-edge teledentistry technology. Their whole platform revolves around convenient, affordable and *remote* orthodontic care. If you really wanna look at what they offer, [this is their website](https://smiledirectclub.ca/en-ca/).

**Why invest?**

Since launching in the U.S. in 2014, SmileDirectClub has become one of the fastest-growing health technology companies, and is right now, serving over one million customers around the world. In January 2020, they expanded its offerings, introducing a complete oral care system, including LED teeth whitening, electric toothbrushes, toothpastes and more. However, due to covid19, they are far from their recent highs. Just three months ago, they were sitting above $15. This stock is currently severely undervalued. It's important to note that their work is mail-based and thus, sales should not be as affected by the lock down compared to dentistry companies. They've expanded due to the quarantine to ship more of their products for at-home use. Their largest competitor (ALGN) has been shut down essentially because they work entirely with dentists. 

Also consider how kids are more vain than ever now and would much rather have clear aligners than braces. What SDC offers is way cheaper than braces too. Hence why insurance companies are picking them up like candy. Cheaper for them and now cheaper for parents, plus covered under insurance to make them even more expendable under FSA and HSA (flexible and health spending account). 

**What's new?**

Right now they have partnerships with UnitedHealthCare and Aetna. But beginning in May, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. These new partnerships with these healthcare insurance companies should lead to increased sales for the direct-to-consumer oral care company over time. [Some reading material](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/06/why-smiledirectclub-stock-is-soaring-today.aspx). 

Those major insurers adding access to them with extended coverage will drive huge revenue growth. I expect SDC to beat earnings and raise guidance due to this news. Stock already popped some on the news the other day. Should go further when it’s discussed more in depth during earnings.

**Earnings?**

Like I said, SmileDirectClub has [it's earnings](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/sdc) on May 13th at 4pm. It will increase guidance due to the insurance deal I mentioned earlier. In addition to this, there's [56%](http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=Sdc&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) short interest with about 5 days to cover. With good earnings, it could all be a powder keg to a huge spike in stock price in a very short window. Like, 40%+ if the stars align. 

**tl;dr** Remote dentistry company that will kill it in earnings. Just got a new insurance deal that should raise guidance. Company is currently far from pre-covid19 valuation. Easy earnings play for next week. **8.50c 5/15 or 8.50c 5/22** And yes AutoMod, I know this is a breadline.

**Edit:** Stock is up 6% since the time of this post. This is standard earnings run up as people are buying with anticipation of a massive beat and the 40%+ gains I mentioned. *This is why* I made sure to post a week early. If you had bought the above calls at the time of this post, you'd be up 30-40%. Keep holding guys.

**Edit 2:** Stock is up 18% since the time of this post, calls should be up over double for both the 5/15 and 5/22 exp. I've hit my profit target and will most likely end up selling before earnings. What you do with your buys are up to you now. You're welcome :)

**Final Edit:** Up 29% since the time of this post. I highly recommend selling before earnings now, rather than ride the risk. This is easily a 10 bagger win. There will be more opportunities like this, will post more DD in the future.",2020-05-07 20:06:06,0.9989,0.5859,0.36797932330827066,0.6509264411027569

2226,DD,ZM: why the market may be substantially underestimating the upside,5,gf8qf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf8qf4/zm_why_the_market_may_be_substantially/,23,1588894419.0,"When I saw everyone shitting on Zoom as an undifferentiated hype stock at WSB, figured there may be a contrarian play, so started doing some digging. Just my view - disclosure, obviously long shares and calls, a few FDs included. Earnings coming up in early June and think there's 2-3x price appreciation potential in the next 6-12 mos. 

TLDR: Zoom undervalued at anything less than $200 a share as market discounting new subscribers. Sorry for the bullet formatting, I tried. 

High level thesis: 
*	Market underestimating the impact of daily participants growth from 10MM/day at end of 2019 to 300MM/day as of early April
*        	While education and other venues have received free access, this does not explain the broader growth. There are 60-70MM people in US at school age. Assuming 25% using Zoom at 5x instances a day, that yields 80-100MM of the 290MM growth from education
*      	Both new and existing enterprise Zoom users have likely rapidly increased adoption in the last 90 days, adding more paying users per company than previously assumed (e.g., a firm with 50 employees that may have shared 4-5 licenses or used a free version is now ramping usage)
*	High free cash flow, subscription revenue business provides visibility into earnings potential on an annualized, runrate basis
*      	Subscription based model that is a small cost per employee, especially compared to traveling for in person meetings (e.g., annual subscription a fraction of the cost of one business trip per year)
*      	Market will price ZM on a quarterly runrate basis derived from paying users, which will be reported in early June along with MD&A on new users through that date
*	Continued COVID issues will drive subscription and paying user growth
*      	Early state reopenings will drive companies to delay return to work and travel due to risks of virus continuing to circulate (e.g., many financial firms banning travel until 2021); consensus for a 2nd wave in the 2H of 2021
*      	Despite reopenings, dual income households unable to go to work due to childcare constraints as schools, daycares, and camps closed until the fall or beyond
*      	COVID accelerating long term shift toward remote working; commercial air travel to remain challenged for next 6-12 months (Evercore surveys point to investors’ belief that business travel does not recover until 2H2021) further entrenching people being comfortable working from home or doing remote meetings
*	Competitive moat built through brand, GUI, and early mover advantage
*      	Zoom is a name brand in the business community; technology not just an app but becomes entrenched in conference room set-ups, internal company procedures and IT stack
*      	Cost of service is de minimis for recent competitive activity from Google or Facebook to matter ($120/user/year not worth behavioral change/shift requirements)
*      	ZM preferred due to GUI, user friendliness (prior to it being banned, Google’s own employees overwhelmingly preferred Zoom and company considered buying Zoom)
*      	Other larger tech companies have challenges in switching Zoom users (FB: personal privacy and bridge to enterprise applications; GOOG: niche user base and need to be in GOOG ecosystem; MSFT: clunky user interface embedded in complex Teams universe, slow to roll out upgrades)

In terms of the risks / bear case for the story, common questions and concerns are the following:

*	Valuation too high: “1000 PE,” “ridiculous revenue multiple” to be addressed shortly. Net net there is visibility into near term runrate $2B in annualized EBITDA, which at a 50x multiple (appropriate given growth), implies substantial price upside
*	“Muh competition”: addressed above. Solutions provided by FB are geared toward social users (who are not paying and ZM doesn’t want anyway); MSFT is too clunky and ZM viewed as a complementary application; GOOG: not everyone wants a gmail account and even Google’s own employees prefer Zoom. Thankfully for the bull case, all these threats are now out in the open and “priced in”
*	All the growth will go away post COVID: 1) COVID not going away anytime soon (see: second wave, mutations, too early openings, residual fears; 2) post conversion, video conferencing will still be used, particularly to save on corporate travel and will replace conference calls that were done prior to COVID. Additionally, companies will want this capability in place for risk mitigation/business continuity. Given this, the subscription users will stay in place and continue to convert from free users 3) the education (K-12/college) users who will go away weren’t paying and will plant seeds for future growth as they join the workforce 4) the growth in users was 30x in the course of 30-60 days
*	“Muh security concerns and Zoom bombing”: acquisition of KeyBase + Eric’s 90 day plan appears to be allaying concerns. Separately, the security concerns appear to be hyped up by competitors vs. actual threats – a number of reputable firms continue to onboard Zoom and NYC schools has reversed its decision. Just note that FB channeled Russian hackers on its platform that changed the outcome of US elections and appears to not effect its valuation. 

Valuation: the gutcheck – stock has appreciated ~2x pre-COVID though daily participants have grown 30x. All else being equal, market is discounting a substantial portion of upside growth. However, it is important to note that FYQ2 (the next quarter being reported for period ending 4/30) will not nearly reflect the runrate performance given most of the recent surge happened late in the quarter. 

*	Context of where we are and what we know about the numbers
**	In the most recent quarter ending January, Zoom generated $188MM in revenue and $10MM of EBITDA. It is important to note that Zoom operates at 82-83% gross margin (that means each incremental dollar generates 80 cents of profit or EBITDA assuming no scale up of backoffice and overhead). Said differently, it is very cheap for Zoom to support incremental user growth as is with most software/subscription businesses
**	On an annualized basis pre-COVID, Zoom was generating roughly $800MM in revenue and $40MM of EBITDA. The low EBITDA margins are due to the SG&A/overhead that has yet to be (but soon will be) leveraged
**	Exiting the most recent quarter, Zoom had 10MM daily participants, which translates into ~$75 of annualized revenue per daily participant (includes both paying and non-paying participants). Note that this 10MM includes those who used the platform for free prior to COVID, so if the same mix of paying and non-paying participants continued, you’d see an unbelievably large ramp in revenue and earnings
**	Zoom grew to 200MM daily participants in early April, then 300MM toward the end of April
**	Obviously, you can’t just take the 300MM x $75 a year factor, which would translate into $24B in annualized revenue – it is likely a larger percentage of free users joined, including college and K-12 students. The question is what %? That’s what I will lay out below. 

*	 Valuing the growth potential – anything less than $200/share is drastically undervaluing Zoom
**	The question is then of the 290MM new daily participants, how closely does that match to the profile of the preexisting 10MM daily participants. That is what we will then apply the $80/annualized revenue figure
**	Being conservative, let’s just assume 20%. That implies 58MM out of the 290MM new daily participants that match the mix of paying/non-paying as pre-COVID users and that the rest of the 230MM will not pay at all
**	That yields to an INCREMENTAL annualized revenue figure of $4.4B ($75/year x 58MM)
**	Back to our gross margin point, Zoom generates 82-83% gross margins
**	Instead of doing a straight calculation on that as flow through, let’s assume another 20-25% cost on the incremental revenue in additional SG&A as well as costs to serve the incremental free users
**	$4.4B x 60% = $2.2B in annualized operating profit (EBITDA)
**	So how do we value ZM on that basis? Question is comparable TEV / EBITDA multiples for fast growing software/SAAS businesses:
***	CRM: 55x LTM EBITDA (35% revenue growth), 8x revenue (more mature, lower margin biz)
***   TDOC: not profitable; 20x LTM Revenue
***	DOCU: not profitable, 20x LTM Revenue
***	TWLO: not profitable, 17x LTM Revenue
**	Assuming a 15x revenue multiple for ZM on runrate revenue ($5B total runrate) = $75B TEV, or $250 share price on 300M shares
***	Assuming a 50x EBITDA multiple like CRM: $108B TEV, or $360 share price
***	Assuming a 30x EBITDA multiple: $65B TEV, $215 share price
**	Now, assume 50x EBITDA and what the value would be if greater than 20% of the new users looked like the profile of Zoom’s existing users, should it be 30 or 50%: 
***	30%: $580/share at 50x EBITDA, $350/share at 30x
***	50%: $1,015/share at 50x, $600/share at 30x, $400/share at 20x (at larger TEV, multiple will be lower as more growth has been realized

The reason why it’s happening is because most of the negative are priced IN and any slight good news is not so today... unemployment again at record level but it’s the lowest augmentation so far... hey it’s a good news!! Market dildo up! 

So..about the next leg down...

It’s gonna go down the same way it did when the virus was still starting to slowly spread...You remember before the crash? Everybody was downplaying the virus, saying it won’t spread into US for numerous reasons and all the denial... I loaded on puts at the precise moment when the market was priced in on the fact that USA wouldn’t be impacted... you know what happened after...

Now today the market has priced in the fact that this virus is temporary and will get fixed quickly AND the economy will re open quickly and biggly in a terrific way starting Q2 then going stronger Q3-Q4... 

At the precise moment the market realize... 

1. Economy reopening is not working 

either stores are open and nobody show up and numbers are bad / stores close back because no customers / state going back to lockdown on infection surge flooding the care system

2. Virus is not going anywhere and a vaccine isn’t happening 2021 ... 

sorry to be grim here but right now only thing we got is the gilead meds reducing a little bit the time to recover which is not enough to say hey go all get infected with the virus so that we can cure it quickly and go back to normal... not happening... 

We have evidence virus is mutating like the flu... you know the current vaccination campaign for the flu and sometimes they miss the prevalent strain? Same could happen WHEN we get a vaccine... and the fact it’s mutating already complicate the effort on finding the vaccine... 

I don’t see an easy and quickly way out of this one... herd immunity seems way far and we still don’t know if you can get it back...

3. The numbers of jobs loss that will be permanent ...

This is not priced in... right now the market expect 95% of all the jobs to be back... won’t happen... unless a vaccine get us back to normal which is gone...

People and market are holding on a pre-war world that isn’t there anymore... mentally will change, the way we do stuff will change and this will require more staff less customers on location at the same time... less revenu/ more cost..

Normal unemployment insurance would give them 40% of their wages about 500 a month. Now with EUA they get 500 +2400 (600 per week) so that they end up with 2900 a month.

I believe any company that is searching for an RNA vaccine for COVID is primed to fail miserably. You search for ""Pharmaceutical RNA Vaccine"" and you'll get a bunch of public companies. They all got pumped the last month because government has been approving clinical trials left and right. The implication is that these companies will actually be successful. First of all, pharmaceuticals, as I have learned, all generate value only if they hit milestones. If they dont hit milestones they dont make money. Second. Vaccines dont make money, they are absolute shit as far as revenue goes. Third of all and perhaps the most important bit is that the last time an RNA vaccine was attempted, it killed a whole bunch of kids. That vaccine was for RSV. If you google RSV vaccine you will see that it was also an RNA vaccine. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88889/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine
>Currently, there are no RNA vaccines approved for human use. 

Here's what I feel you all need to know. COVID19 is a strain of the Corona Viruses. You have all had a corona virus in the past and not even known it because they cause the common cold. They are similar, but not exactly like Rhino Virus, also a cold causing virus. 

What all these pharma companies are getting funding for and generating hype over is the development of a vaccine for the common cold. If it hasnt happened yet, it sure as hell wont happen in the next 12 - 18 months. 


So if you were thinking about being first in line to get the vaccine, don't.

Until you test the shit out of it. You are likely to run into this:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12725690
>In general, virus-specific antibodies are considered antiviral and play an important role in the control of virus infections in a number of ways. However, in some instances, the presence of specific antibodies can be beneficial to the virus. This activity is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection. The ADE of virus infection is a phenomenon in which virus-specific antibodies enhance the entry of virus, and in some cases the replication of virus, into monocytes/macrophages and granulocytic cells through interaction with Fc and/or complement receptors.

IMHO. The only real treatment is anti-virals, which by there nature should work and why Remdesivir and Hydroxycloroquine could work. But I also feel that plain old DNA vaccines which is what the Flu vaccine is has  a lot more promise. But.... creating a DNA vaccine, which means creating an attenuated (dead or inactive) virus is going to take a long time and so will the testing.

Go read those posts if you want to understand $HEAR better but the high level is that they have holiday season level traffic to their sites and have been suffering from stock outs at their retailers (while they entered Q1 heavy on inventory).   Everyone is playing video games during COVID and getting a new headset to win at plunder on Modern Warfare:  Warzone.

**Why July?**

It is extremely likely that $HEAR will make it into the Russell 2000 index if it simply holds most of its current value through earnings (let alone the pop everyone is expecting from guidance like Spring 2018 when PUBG/Fortnite caused an upsurge in headsets).

[Russell 2000 reconstitution rank day](https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution) is May 8 (tomorrow!).  Don't think that ER wasn't specifically planned for May 7th because it was.

Transitions in the ETFs and other funds following Russell 2000 are completed by June 26 when the index takes effect.   Between June 5 when preliminary list of Russell 2000 is released and June 26 when the index takes effect, loads of dollars MUST pour into $HEAR for the sake of tracking the index, regardless of where the stock is at.

Therefore, 17 JUL calls (the premium isn't much more than 15 MAY and IV is much lower).

&#x200B;

Long 17 JUL @ 10c, 12.5c, 17.5c

Pros:

1. They have new cameras for video conferencing, new high quality gaming mouses that are cheap and affordable. Sales drastically increased in October and since the start of the Corona virus shutdown in March, sales have completely peaked. Everything is sold out. Quarter two earnings will be phenomenal and quarter one earnings on May 11 will beat expectations. Schools are shut down until the end of the year and a second corona wave will come meaning the demand for this tech stock will rise.
2. LOGI releases a new product every 3-6 months based off their release notes.
3. LOGI completed its initiated May 2017 share buyback program April 30 purchasing a total of 2,902,071 shares. They are announced that they are intending to enter a new share buyback program which is predicted to be released on or prior to earnings report.
4. They have a healthy balance sheet boasting a total assets of 2,024,124 over total liabilities of 847,785.
5. The volume for LOGI options is currently low. This means that there is a high bid ask spread currently but at low prices. If you buy in now the premiums will rise by next week.
6. LOGI is at an all-time high and I believe it will continue to soar due to outstanding sales, factories opening up producing products therefore supply chain management issues are reduced, and the share buy back program they are announcing as guidance for the year.
7. Pre-Corona the industry was booming and now everyone is at home it is continuing to MOON. Companies have given stipends to go out and buy LOGI equipment. They are a reputable brand name.
8. Currently as of this post, the put call ratio is at a whopping 208:1 at mornings open.
9. TECH stock: stocks only go up
10. They have beat every single earnings that last two years and mooned every single time.
11. RSI is at 65.28. not oversold or over bought. 70 and 30 are my two reference points.
12. LOGI has broke resistance and continues to stay above it with no signs of dropping. It has hit 50 before last year and now it will surpass 50 easily and in June as well due to 2nd quarter earnings.
13. This is not a financial crisis. People make more from unemployment or have more net positive income due to deferrals of car, phone, rent payments. LOGI is shown to be recession and corona proof.

The bottom line is: their costs are minimal thanks to COVID, their revenue is HUGE! They're going to totally blow this earnings report out of the water and have lots of cash to reinvest into the company and continue to grow. In fact, they've beaten on all their last few earnings.

> In response to the debate over the highly unlikely ‘nuclear option’, China could cut its holdings as the US ramps up borrowing to pay coronavirus-related costs

https://amp.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3083100/coronavirus-china-could-cut-us-debt-holdings-response-white

While analysts added that the US was highly unlikely to take the “nuclear option”, the mere fact that the idea has been discussed could well prompt Beijing to seek to insulate itself from the risk by reducing its US government debt holdings.

 
That, in turn, could spell trouble for the US government bond market at a time when Washington is significantly ramping up new issuance to pay for a series of programmes to combat the pandemic and the economic damage it is causing.

“It's such a crazy idea that anyone who has made it should really have their fitness for office reconsidered,” said Cliff Tan, East Asian head of global markets research at MUFG Bank. “We view this as largely a political ploy for [Donald Trump’s] re-election and a cynical one because it would destroy the financing of the US federal budget deficit.”

But any move to cancel the debt owed to China – effectively defaulting on it – would be counterproductive to US interests because it would likely destroy investors’ faith in the trustworthiness of the US government to pay its bills, analysts warned.

 
This would send US interest rates soaring, making borrowing more costly for the government, as well US companies and consumers, and in turn strike a sharp blow to America’s already very weak economy.

Instead, China could cut back or stop buying new US Treasury issues, which would gradually reduce its holdings of US government securities as old ones expire and are not replaced. “In the coming months, [China could] halt its Treasury purchases to send a clear signal of its intentions,” said Pang. “If it decides to do that, it could make actual sales [of its other holdings] at a later date.”

&#x200B;

I first want to start by saying I'm an autist and not a geneticist or have a degree in bioinformatics. If you want to read the a good source that you can use for your own dd here you go: [https://medium.com/@yurideigin/lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748](https://medium.com/@yurideigin/lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748)

&#x200B;

But let's be honest, most of the words in that article are more the two syllables and you guys won't get passed the first couple paragraphs so I'll summarize the most important parts.

&#x200B;

Sars-Cov-2 is a chimera (genetic splicing of different viruses/organisms)

It is 96% identical to Bat corona-virus RaTG13. Most of the differences are found in the Receptor-Binding Motif (RBM). This is the RNA that is responsible to make the S2 Glyco-protein (the thing that attaches to the ace2 receptor to infect your cells). 

If you just look at just the RBM Sars-Cov-2 is almost identical to a Pangolin Corona virus MP789 from Guangdong.

&#x200B;

The things I just told you are all known by the public. The consensus that is being publicly spoken about is that these two virus or mutated variations of them infected the same host in the wet market in Wuhan and through genetic recombination created the BatSoup Virus we have today. Which would absolutely be possible. But here is where is gets fucked.... 

&#x200B;

Lady's (maybe...) and Autists I present to you the smoking gun...

https://preview.redd.it/szgz695e4bx41.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5339c11500b523929869753543703302866140

That image is an amino acid (AA) comparison between all 3 viruses. Each letter represents a different AA. The red letters are where the AA's are different between the strains being compared. The smoking gun is the highlighted four AA series PRRA. Underneath that are 4 red stars indicating an insertion. While this can happen naturally, it is highly unlikely this is the case. Especially since this little 4 AA insertion is incredibly important and the reason why Sars-Cov-2 is highly transmissible.

&#x200B;

The amino acid after PRRA is R. This forms the sequence RRAR. RRAR is what is called a polybasic ferin cleavage site. Ferin is a special molecule in our bodies and it goes around and finds these site and cuts the amino acid chain at the cleavage site. Now the author goes into detail on the mechanisms but i don't really understand it. Basically it makes the virus highly transmissible and virulent. 

&#x200B;

Adding these cleavage sites is very common in Gain of Function research. Where scientist make virus more functional in human models to anticipate future threats and make therapeutics to counter these phenomena. My theory is that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was playing around in the lab and forgot to clean their shoes and this got out accidentally. When the Chinese found out they tried to keep it a secret and that's how it spread world-wide.

&#x200B;

This is the evidence that trump has been talking about about this virus coming from a lab. If I found this in between jerking off and being a degenerate on Robinhood then it's only a matter of time before it's on every news station around the world. That's when the next leg down starts.

&#x200B;

Panic will set in again after this comes out and the virus tears us a new one when we start to open up again. This is what will give the bears their strength.

It peaked on 3/23 from SPY puts. Of course I was a 🌈🐻 and lost almost all of it with SPY 200p 4/20, got out when I was up about 1.5k so a little profit from the start. But in the last week I was trying to save my puts by day trading SPY options. I made $12,468 in a week day trading with an account worth about 30k (70% cash 30% puts).

I had over 25k so no PDT rule. My strategy was to buy 15-17k in spy options, in favor of whichever way the ticker was trending up or down, and sell them at a limit price once they gained anywhere from 1-4%. The mean of all 38 trades that week totaled to $328.11 which is a 2.05% gain per trade with 16k. I could have made more if I had used the entire 21k cash I had but I did not want to risk all of the money I had to my name.

In 5 trading days, off of 38 trades I had 100% accuracy. Every one of my trades was a hit because I wasn’t waiting for the one big return. I took my profits as soon as they came in and since they were ranging from $65 lowest gain - $1040 highest gain I felt good walking away from each trade having made on average over $300 per.

I was so focused on taking a piece of the whole pie with my 200p 4/20, that I completely skipped the easy money that’s in the crumbs. My account dropped below 25k after buying more puts and I took everything out of RH and I got a 90 day ban from day trading that expires on June 27th. Come Monday, June 29th I’m going to try my strategy again starting with $1,000 and I’ll compound my weekly gains adding a little bit of cash every month until I get to 25k and then the big money will start coming in.

TLDR: Lost everything SPY 220p, but developed a strategy that earned me $12,468 in one week with 100% accuracy on 38 trades.

I've enjoyed y'all a lot lately. There's a lot of really smart folks on here that hide behind feigned autism - frankly you're all probably smarter than I am. That's why I'd appreciate your input/enjoy the read.  

$EE *El Paso Electric* provides generation, transmission and distribution services to 400,000+ retail and wholesale customers throughout New Mexico and West Texas. It also owns a 15.8% stake in the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant.  

On June 1, 2019, IIF Infrastructure Investments Fund entered an agreement to purchase $EE at $68.25 per share or [$4.3 billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-paso-electric-m-a-infrastructure-i/el-paso-electric-to-be-bought-by-an-infrastructure-fund-for-2-78-billion-idUSKCN1T41K8). At the time, $EE was trading at $57 with $3.8 billion in assets. Obviously, it jumped to $68.25 where it has mostly remained... *(Although oddly enough it touched $63 during the March crash and an incredible amount of shares changed hands - More than when the takeover was originally announced)*

IIF would have 1 year to clear array of regulatory hurdles to complete the purchase. May be extended up to 9/1 with conditions ([See agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/31978/000114036119010234/form8k.htm)).

[Then-CEO of El Paso Electric Mary Kipp](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/31978/000114036119010234/ex99_3.htm) sent a [letter to employees](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/56011934): ""IIF is a private investment vehicle advised by a dedicated infrastructure investment group within J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc."" Mary goes on to note that 'IIF is a fund responsible for investing and growing the retirement funds of more than 40 million families, including 2 million families across Texas and New Mexico'. $EE would be joining IIFs family of 19 companies, including companies in NA, Europe and Australia, 11 of which were utilities as well. Mary Kipp then resigned from the company by July 1, 2019, leaving millions on the table. *Hmm...*

The consumer advocacy group *Public Citizen* quickly took issue then with the apparent upstream ownership, filing interference by 8/13 and then this complaint in [September](https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?document_id=14800629) 2019. Public Citizen linked IIF to JPMorgan and [it was denied vehemently](https://prospect.org/environment/jpmorgan-concedes-trying-to-buy-an-electric-utility/). In fact, all the companies in the 'family' of IIF are linked to the same 3 individuals \[PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE PER FOLLOWING LINKS\] Rita J. Sallis, Christopher Ward and Dennis Clarke: [https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file\_list.asp?document\_id=14802626](https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?document_id=14802626);   [https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/56011934](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/56011934). Also, in addition to being managed by those same 3 - the business addresses for all IIF funds link back to JP Morgan Investment Bank. 

[These findings, along with COVID19, have strengthened Public Citizen and the senate to pressure the FERC into a rehearing](https://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?document_id=14859120)\- likely pushing the deal beyond the 6/1 deadline. When Public Citizen reveals the deliberate attempt to conceal affiliations, armed with senators in an election year, this deal could be trashed. Public Citizen may also reveal that this has been going on for a while. I can't wait for '*the smartest guys in the room' #2*:

Some financial statement related DD at 1), which you can totally  skip. Some other discussion items on 2), 3), and 4).

**1) Adjusted EBITDA**

I am confused with this Adjusted EBITDA figure because I do think the actual EBITDA is lower than -$612m. See, there are two ways of getting to EBITDA from income statements and I know there is no standard measure for this so companies add back any item they feel under ""Adjustments""..

But if you're curious, the easiest way to look at this is starting off from Revenue...

https://preview.redd.it/ol6ohyynumx41.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea3361b94442109bff24ca707855a09e89a0554

Here the easiest way to look at EBITDA is by deducting cost of revenue, operating expenses, R&D expenses and basically anything above your operating profit. Usually depreciation is not reported separately, but UBER does so (see the note that cost of revenue is exclusive of depreciation anyway) so no need to add back. Another item to add back that makes sense is the stock-based compensation which is part of your operation expenses in the income statement but is a non-cash item so doing all of this brings us to a proper EBITDA loss of $858m.

Now the way UBER calculate their Adjusted EBITDA is by reconciling from Net income, which is shown here.

https://preview.redd.it/w58eca0bvmx41.png?width=708&format=png&auto=webp&s=9de2d7adffb749adb4d56c848d0cd4ca9a2c80e7

You would expect these two reconciliations to be consistent but let's say UBER does add back other items such as COVID-19 response etc (which they actually adjust in revenue but it would not matter from a math perspective).

You see, the logic is that all the other items should somehow need to be reflected in your income statement such as the interest expense, net loss to minority, other income etc. One of the weird items here is the goodwill and asset impairments adjustment of $193m, which actually is not shown anywhere in the income statement. Typically, I'd expect to see the loss in there but while it is shown in CF statement, it is not part of the other items in income statement. So while you start off with your Income statement reported Net income, you go and add back an item that is not there.

So it looks like our difference of $246m, can be attributed to COVID response of 24m, UBER eats india transaction of 10m, and some legal, tax items of $19m and that $193m...I think it makes sense to add back some of these items but not including that $193m in the income statement is weird to me, as its already being adjusted in the cash flow statement.

**2) Year over year growth**

While for certain businesses looking at year over year results makes sense because of seasonality, I don't see why it would make sense for a growth stock like UBER.  It is only natural to beat your metric that is from 3 quarters a go, simply because you are growth stock. And market has already priced in that growth a year a go anyway. So year over year is meaningless, especially when quarter over quarter UBER has shrunk and not grown.

So when we have Q2 and Q3 results that will not beat their year over year measures given how things look, what is the headline going to be?

**3) Business trips and Pooling and COVID**

I do think one economies of scale of shared drive companies have is the pooling service, by which you generate more revenue for almost the same cost/mileage - something Taxi cab drivers would dream. While it's a great idea because it is a win-win for both the company and the consumer, social distancing that I expect to be the norm in the next few months will definitely harm this.

At the end of the day, you might think twice when you're sharing a Toyota Camry back seat with 3 random drunk people in the middle of the night.

Other growth area I've always considered big for shared drives are the business people segment. Thinking of it, UBER solves a great problem with all this business travel where you don't have to think about renting a car/trying to get a cab in places you don't know - you call your UBER as soon as you land, knowing that its waiting for you. And since you are not paying for it, you will call the premium car whatever the distance.

Problem is, most businesses that require travel such as consulting/advisory, finance etc., will not be going anywhere at least until September.  I do think intra country business travel will be reduced greatly, and shared drive is going to get affected.

**4) UBER EATS potential**

This one is really an open discussion. The reason why I am skeptical about this one is that this that I think economies of scale is much harder here. Again, I think pooling is the greatest thing from a shared drive company perspective, but it is not as simple to implement the same for UBER EATS as the normal riding.

While your algorithm can certainly identify two orders in close vicinity so your driver can drop both of these, this one is much more time sensitive than pooling for shared drive. At at the end of day, you may be ok to wait in the car listening to your music while the person before you is being dropped off, you will not wait the driver to drop off your food in 3 different places (and he has to get off the car, go to the door, find the apt etc.) as you dont want a have cold pizza delivered in 50 mins.

While EATS might have partnership with big chains, some of them will definitely create their own platforms (such as Domino's) as they will be much more efficient than you can ever be. Add on top this, the cost burden to restaurants who are not happy, the competition from all sorts of apps and so on.

The key thing here is while you may want to get into an UBER car for its convenience/premium thing, you probably do not care how your food is delivered, i.e. some random dude in Toyota Camry or in a Cadillac Escalade. Therefore you don't have the same convenience/loyalty/premium service aspect here in EATS, all of a sudden there is no customer stickiness at all. Yes you still collect loyalty points, but given their fees and and tips, do you want to get your food cheaper or not? You are sitting your home anyway so it does not matter how things are delivered in the background.

And finally, if you cant be profitable from EATS during COVID or day 1, how sustainable is that business model as there is no real economies of scale as I mentioned earlier.

This presents a unique opportunity going into May. As many may know from my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gczz67/intermediate_outlook_on_the_natural_gas_ng_market/)([s](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g239f4/natural_gas_ngk20_play_for_tomorrow_416/)) about Natural Gas futures, the market for the commodity has been experiencing severe demand destruction for the last month and a half, similar to the market for crude oil (WTI). The EIA released its usual [Natural Gas Storage report](http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html) this last Thursday morning, indicating a three-digit build for the week ended measured in billion cubic feet. This was in alignment with expectations regarding the build, and it has been noted by multiple analysts that the Natural Gas market's downward finish this week was mostly due to the rerouting of gas production after an explosion at the Texas Eastern Transmission (Tetco) system (prices initially surged because traders figured gas production would be hindered; albeit not as much as they thought).

So, since the market demand is down, what are the producers going to do about it that hasn't been baked into the trading entirely? Mass production shut-ins are anticipated by many analysts which could see a price for Natural Gas higher than $2.10/mmbtu by the end of the month, according to [Natural Gas Intel](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121931-natural-gas-forward-prices-find-footing-despite-continued-volatility-uncertainty) (NGI). Various analytics groups including EBW have pointed to ""steep declines"" in Natural Gas output for the coming weeks as producers continue to cut back to combat the demand destruction. These declines have been in alignment with various models thus far. In addition, 'net short' positions for Natural Gas futures became 'net long' recently, according to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-natural-gas-prices-are-a-hot-bet-11588339279) mentioning that speculative bets that were ""very bearish"" in the last month or so, have been completely unwound now.

Broader market implications in the energy industry could have bearing on the price of Natural Gas in the next couple months as well, according to [NGI](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/articles/121934-global-oil-supply-cuts-now-seen-reaching-17-million-bd-in-2q). Analysts are predicting the largest liquid oil shut-in in the energy industry's history during Q2, mostly driven by OPEC, Russia, and North America. A broad reduction in crude oil production will severely limit Natural Gas production, as much of it is a byproduct of WTI. As the energy producers continue to react to the COVID-19 environment and reduced demand, energy prices should continue to see overall growth in the next month despite the volatility of the markets. This has already been evidenced by the front month crude oil (CL) and Natural Gas (NG) contracts rising significantly since crude oil was negative momentarily last month.

The contract was up to $.30 AH, seemed to settle around $.22.  


I googled and reddit'ed for 58 minutes and then called my broker. Turns out they would have exercised on a cash deal if I had called about 5 minutes earlier.   


Oh and yah those options were a wild ride. That big dick green candle ( to $293.95)  at 3:50 spiked my options to $2.20 per contract, but it was only for a moment.   


Anyways more clarity in comments would be great. The consensus on what I heard from people was all over the place.

Fundamentals

· Diversified hardware/software company, provide switches/enterprise networking hardware, VPN, cyber security

· Aim has been to pivot away from hardware sales (56%) toward more of a software play including a large focus on cyber security

· Previous ER recorded a 4% decrease in Non-GAAP operating margins

·  Circa USD 9 bln net cash position/rock solid balance sheet – big enough to provide USD 2.5 bln financing for large hardware purchases until 2021 to ensure companies can still upgrade despite uncertainty (from CEO)

· Owns Webex (recording 14 billion meeting minutes in March vs 6 in January) 

·  COVID-19 potential catalysts from an increase in work from home (VPN/Cloud), WebEx adoption and also possible upgrades of data centers/Cisco Meraki hardware. Also active in the tele-health sector

·  Increase in web traffic (remember Netflix reducing video quality?) is another potential catalyst for their hardware segment as tech companies  could be panic adding capacity

·  CEO mentioned they had been working around the clock on video interview with CNBC, to ensure businesses stay functioning through COVID-19

·  Recent conference call on their investor relations website outlining  their remote work portfolio seems to have been slept on also price wise

Technical

· Stock traded in 50’s, for much of 2019 then was slapped down by trade war headlines

· Dumped last 3 ER’s , trade war related fears – expectations for upcoming ER are low

· Previous ER’s have shown decent jumps (check 2018)

· Hasn’t recovered like competing networking stocks (Juniper Networks, Arista networks)

· Option volatility has also remained quite low throughout March/April – options pretty much imply no movement

· Bottomed and bounced from the upper 30’s to low 40’s and has been stuck in a range since

·  Stock has tried to break out several times in April, random dumps due to macro related factors (mid April – negative Oil fears, 29th - 1st May  dump from tech sell-off/supposed trade deal collapsing tweet)

Possible risk factors mostly come from big IT spending being potentially put on hold due to companies having cash flow issues/supply chain issues  delaying hardware production (as stated by other networking hardware markers) – biggest catalysts for a potential dump post ER. Equally could  surprise to upside given all the coronavirus related catalysts and low expectations

I have been around many of these people, while my puts get fisted, who are blindly throwing money into the stock market. It seems to me that there is is a perception that every company that could be positively impacted at all by a re-opening is a great value. Doesn't matter if that stock is up 20%, 40%, or 80% during this rally or not. As long as they will make more money tomorrow than today if theres a re-opening, it's a great buy. And if a stock whose whole value story is built upon the work from home / stay at home economy retreats by 3% in value, those same people have literally told me it's an awesome dip to buy the stock. 

So with that in mind, that everything is going up in tandem, whether it is because of the stay at home story or because of the opposite, I am increasingly convinced that something that scares people into thinking the world is ending will be what it takes to even have a 3% down week. I thought it would be earnings, but we all saw and joked about the countless disaster quarters and guidance followed by double-digit rallies. 

My other concern is that, if cases do start to truly spike (anyone who isn't brainwashed knows they're trending worse than anticipated, but the market doesn't care), or if consumers aren't confident in going to these now-open businesses, these same people will think it's ""fake news."" I'm not trying to make this political at all, but I'll just say that a large portion of people (and lots of them with money) truly believe that anyone in politics or business who expresses concern about the coronavirus cases/deaths or says that we should pump the brakes on re-opening is doing so because they want the economy and stock market to go down so Trump doesn't get elected. 

tl;dr - lots of people with money believe that any bad news is fake and that every stock is a good value, those people won't believe bad news because it won't come from Trump's mouth, the market will keep rallying unless there's some huge black swan event that cannot be spun or argued.",2020-05-09 01:14:16,0.9851,0.0,0.22739288702928875,0.4041642956764296

Competing for the Darwin awards bad. The only first world countries that have a higher per-capita infection rate are Spain, Belgium and Iceland, all of which have a significantly fewer new cases per day today compared to their peak infection rate.

[https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (Click on the countries to the left to see how many new cases are reported compared to the peak)

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html) (Change view to per capita cases)

Evidence of the continued spread in the USA can be seen in the rising of cases outside of NY.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-cases-united-states.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-cases-united-states.html)

This also takes into account the testing rate, since new deaths are dropping in NY, yet the rest of the countries total deaths remains nearly  constant.

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html) (scroll down to reported deaths).

vs

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) (scroll down to reported deaths).

Since there is a lag in data, about 1-2 weeks for new detected cases and 4 weeks for deaths, it means that the non-NY social distancing measures between \~4/10-4/24 were insufficient to control the spread of the virus. With the loosening of state restrictions, it means the R0 number today will be higher than it was in the two weeks of 4/10-4/24, meaning there will be more new infections per day outside of NYC in 1-2 weeks then there are today.

So, what does this mean? The US may ""flatten"" the curve, but not control the spread of the virus. In other words, the virus will continue to spread for the foreseeable future in an uncontrolled fashion (with an R0 value very close to 1 meaning daily new cases/death counts remain mostly the same). That  doesn't necessarily mean there will be another spike in infections (although that is possible).

Why is this? Well, here are the key differences between the USA and (most) other first world countries

1. Lack national contact tracing program
2. Insufficient testing - especially for rural communities
3. Insufficient PPE for hospitals and essential workers
4. Lack of national quarantine plan
5. A desire by a minority (\~5-10% of the population - anti-vaxxers and the like) to ignore most safety recommendations (masks, no visiting family, etc) - and no repercussions if safety recommendations are ignored
6. Reopening Super-spreader locations (Churches, factories, and salons) where spread can continue even with
7. A refusal by top leadership (Trump Administration) to coordinate an international response - Reduces the ability of countries to coordinate responses such as short term travel bans to hotspots, share PPE, share ventilators, share information, etc.
8. A refusal of top leadership (Trump Administration) to coordinate an national response - Reduces state-by-state differences and leverages the best scientists to create a baseline plan for the country.
9. Growing partisanship about the response creating a lack of a response (mostly noticeable in mask wearing). This increases the spread as many anti-vaxxer types see wearing a mask/social distancing as a ""liberal"" issue rather than a ""national"" issue, meaning the virus spreads more.

There are a lot of big economies (France, Germany, China, Japan, South Korea,  Italy, Australia, Switzerland, Spain, Netherlands, and Turkey) that have reduced the number of new infections to controllable levels.

[https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) (Click on the country in the left pane and click on the daily cases in the bottom right window).

Since the new infection rate is low, that means if they determine a person is infected, they can perform contact tracing on that person, determine who they were in close contact with, and then quarantine everybody who they were in close contact with. This can reduce the number of new infections by a significant amount (I'm guessing reducing the likelihood of another  infection by 75% - bringing the R0 value down significantly below 1) without social distancing efforts. There is no indication that the US will have any of this type of capability for at least 3 months. Probably closer to 6. The issue being a lack of national leadership. States may implement this, but many slow states such as Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Kansas may not have the resources or political will to get something like this going quickly.

Okay, so what does all this mean for businesses and stocks and investments.

If you live in one of these countries where new infection rate are low with contact tracing, you are free to go out and spend money without worrying about getting infected. Higher confidence = higher spending. Additionally, these countries are going to be looking to fully re-open their economies  (football games, bars, casinos, etc). With that, they'll be stuck between two options. One, keep their economy open to the US and risk a new outbreak (and thus the economic hit) or close their economy to the US and take the  economic hit until the US gets the virus under control. Essentially, a travel ban of people traveling from the US (and other countries that don't have the virus under control - Russia, Canada, UK, etc in that list) could be possible.

Another affect of this, which is more important for us, if the US has an uncontrolled spread of the virus, that means factories will be shut down at random (as an outbreak occurs in a factory) in the US for a period of 3-6 months where other country's factories are humming along. With a reduced demand rate, that creates a huge competitive advantage for other countries to provide reliable supply. That means that buyers of products will look for alternative supplies outside of US. This means that big businesses such as GM, BA, F, GE, etc lose long-term market share to competitors in other countries. This can hit other places such as  entertainment where no new US movies are produced, and no US sports are produced.

To me, this points to not just a slow L shaped recovery. It means that the GDP of the USA will be lower in 2021-22 than it was in 2019. Other countries (Japan, China, South Korea) could see a full recovery by the beginning of 2021.

A small-cap fin-tech company that provides 3rd parties a marketing channel inside apps like Wells Fargo & Bank of America, through consumer cash-back deals. They're also able to provide aggregate consumer spending analytics to those 3rd party marketers as well, to best understand how they stack up against competitors and the macroeconomic landscape. They derive these insights through partnerships with major financial institutions. Cardlytics has data on 1/2 of card swipes in the US. They provide a win for consumers, because they get cash-back deals; they provide a win for banks via profit sharing; they provide a win to marketers through consumer analytics.

&#x200B;

**How has Cardlytics stock fared in COVID times?**

Since their IPO in February 2018, they've shot up - starting at $13 and almost reaching $100 prior to COVID. Now they're \~$50.

On March 3rd , the stock fell from $85 to $54. A $30 single day drop. That was after posting *positive* earnings for the first time since IPO. Still, the drop seemed to be related to the founder-CEO leaving... to become Chairman of the Board, among [other leadership shakeups](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cardlytics-stock-plunges-more-than-25-after-ceo-departure-earnings-2020-03-03).

Cardlytics ticker in my Schwab Street Smart Edge terminal. Full disclosure, I bought at $65 5/15/2020 call after doing this DD, as you can see on the chart with the green line.

**What drives Cardlytics earnings and how strong is their financial position?**

According to their 10K, Cardlytics makes almost all of their revenue off of profit sharing from their consumer deals on banking apps. You can see this detailed on page 39 of their [10K](https://ir.cardlytics.com/static-files/3f393054-6fa9-4ab2-84c9-8a1d53ced724). They've seen strong growth YOY, which makes sense given broader digital trends. 2017-2019, topline went from $147m to $227m.

Also, Cardlytics financial solvency position is fantastic. They carry $105,000,000 in cash, $37,000 of debt, and \~$78,000,000 in liabilities. Much of the liabilities are payments given back to their banking partners, making up about 50% of liabilities. In short, they seem to be in a financially strong position.

**How can we expect Cardlytics to fare in COVID times?**

My guess is, fairly well. They make money off of people buying deals in banking apps. Given mass work from home in America, Amazon and other online retailers increased volumes show that people are sitting at home bored, and so they're buying things online. So why not buy a Kindle and get 20% cash back (see screenshot below)?

Prior to COVID, I recall these deals being mainly from COVID-hurt companies - airlines, cruises, theme parks. But it seems they've successfully pivoted and added new marketers to match demand.

**Since the March 3rd, insiders have been buying up CDLX, to the tune of \~$33,000,000 in net purchases.**

This is an indication that people within the company thought it was heavily undervalued. Insiders saw a deal and they took it. Source is [here](https://www.insider-monitor.com/trading/cik1666071.html).

**Conclusion**

Cardlytics is riding a digital transformation wave, where spend is naturally trending online. COVID is a catalyst to that trend. Yet, it seems the market may have acted irrationally when selling off around March. And so, I'm betting on next week's call being quite positive. Maybe they'll even break the March 3rd gap? I'd love to hear thoughts, comments, questions, concerns!

This was my response. I would really like to know if there are any others out there who see things like I do... (sorry for the wall of text)

The dow is a composite of the valuations of companies over the next 5 years.

The real question is do you believe that these companies lost over 50% of their earning potential for the next 5 years in a matter of a month?

The dow is pricing in the future. It seems that market movers are betting that in the next 5 years things will be moving way beyond where they are today.

Everybody looks a the money printing going out of control and wonders why we are still experiencing relative deflation... In reality the typical individual doesn't understand just how bad things really are. Do you even realize how much notional cash is tied up in derivatives/options/financial instruments? The real shit hits the fan when BANKS start to lose confidence in their own scam and currency that was held up in derivatives exits into stocks, gold, bitcoin faster than shit through a goose.

You really need to stop thinking of everything in terms of USD and start thinking of everything you own and how much real value does it have. You have to remember USD or any other currency is just another asset (quickly becoming a liability). As a currency, it's value is supposed to be maintained as a stable measure, however as an asset its value does fluxuate albeit very predictable and minor. When that changes it will be all at once. The common person will not have the opportunity to exit the currency when the big derivative accounts are liquidated all at once.

Only problem for me is I usually don’t buy options. After the initial crash in March I’ve switched to being a proud Theta-Ganger.

I’ve been on the correct side of a lot of earnings plays these past few weeks: BYND, PTON, SNAP to name a few. Only difference is when y’all were buying Calls, I was mainly selling Cash Covered Puts.

This resulted in a lot of quick flips and easy money, but far less profit than if I had bought Calls.

My theta-gang compromise involves both. Using CSCO as an example, I sold a CCP, bought Calls, and still came out with a net-credit.

$39.50p 5/29 is what I sold for $60 credit

$50c 5/29 x4 is what I bought for $46

For those not familiar, selling a Put requires a lot more collateral, in this case $3950. This is one downside to being an options seller. The upside is there’s a lot more scenarios where I’m a “winner”. IV crush (Vega), and time decay (Theta) are my best friends, especially the day after earnings.

Another personal upside is that I’m perfectly okay with buying CSCO at $39.50. In fact I think that’s a fucking steal, and I can even sell Covered Calls on them if I do get assigned.

Also, at the time I made this play, there was a 75% chance that my Put doesn’t end up in the money. This puts the odds very much in my favor to exit this trade profitably.

I haven’t seen a name for this play but I unofficially deem it the Cash Covered YOLO.

This will be my first time trying it out, but it appears to be a nice way to get some more upside on your plays, while sacrificing some credit upfront.",2020-05-08 23:42:02,0.9993,0.7297,-0.9999,0.24303333333333335

Meanwhile in China's case, their shutdown lasted longer. They lifted restrictions once daily cases were very very low.


Once the # of cases start to slow, it's quick to come down to near 0 since it's logarithmic as it hits the carrying capacity. The importance of not lifting restrictions early is that the # of cases might go back to increasing at the same rate before.


The [carrying capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity#/media/File:Logistic_Carrying_Capacity.svg) of the virus is lowered when people are in quarantine, because it's the most important environmental limit for the virus.

This is for 5/5-5/8. I’m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem ""important"" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

&#x200B;

Sorry I missed a day, there was no good DD because the people that write it on Tuesdays and Wednesdays are even more retarded then the rest of us. Lets get right into it, I have a few today. First is Cisco. If you don't agree with me then skip it and go to the next one because all of these are quality plays in my opinion.

&#x200B;

**CSCO;** Everyone and their boyfriend is advocating for calls here, remember that. Cisco Systems is a company that makes products related to the communications and information technology industry, provides infrastructure platforms, including networking technologies, communications technologies, and internet security software. All these things are very important when a large portion of the population is working from home. Once more, they have consistently beat earnings the last 3 quarters. Their next earnings (Q3 for them) is released on Wednesday 5/13 and I assume that they will beat earnings.

Now from that information it seems like I’m going to advocate for calls right? Nope. WITHOUT FAIL, their price has tanked after earnings for the past 3 quarters. Weird right? On 8/13/19 (Q4) they were trading at $52, earnings on the 14th they dropped, by the 15th the price was at $46. 11/13/19 (Q1) they were trading at $48, earnings came out, 11/14/19 they hit $44. 2/12/20 (Q2) they were trading at $50, earnings came out, 2/13/20 they were at $47. They beat earnings each time but drop quite a bit. This quarter is already expected to be a loss but they are going to beat their expected earnings of course because they consistently do.

I see[ all these posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfv64m/ok_heres_another_good_dd_for_you_twats_csco_529/) saying[ calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfg47b/cisco_systems_csco/),[ calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfax7l/cisco_csco_calls_will_print/), calls. Sure, calls will work on the run up probably. There is also a pretty large run-up before earnings historically. So here's what I’m going to do. Next time there is a drop (which will probably be Monday) I am going to buy calls. I will let those ride up to just before the closing bell on 5/13 and I will sell all of them. At the top on Wednesday, I am going to double down on my puts to take into account the price jump from the past few days. Then when they drop on 5/14, WHICH THEY ALWAYS DO, I will sell and have made money on the up and down. Whatever you do, don't hold through earnings. All the people advocating for this are looking at the numbers only and no historic trends whatsoever. Or do hold. I couldn't care less what you did with your money.

&#x200B;

**LOGI;** I do, however,[ agree with this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfuid0/logitech_logi_earnings_report_next_week/). Logitech is going to crush earnings and keep going up. They are a PC gaming accessory company. Shit like headphones, keyboards, webcams (for all the cam girls), microphones, stuff like that. Gaming in general is killing in this market but webcams are sold out too because everyone needs it for their company zoom calls. They are at all time highs right now. With all ATH’s, come a sell off to lock in gains. I am going to try and get in on the next dip for calls but sell as soon as I can after earnings because there will be a drop that's just how it works. Earnings are Monday (5/11) after hours so this is a time sensitive play.

&#x200B;

**BOX;** Next, Box, a tech company that specializes in IT, tech management, cloud content, computer shit. Now the difference between them and the other companies is that they deal with the big companies like Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Morgan Stanley, GE, and a bunch more.[ This post goes into](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfm6mi/think_inside_the_box_dd/) a little bit more detail. In an extremely connected market driven by a FUCKING PANDEMIC, their product (cloud security, business applications, tech overhaul) sells itself. The good thing is that their quarters are all wonky. Their fiscal year ends 1/31 so their Q1 includes 2 solid months of boosted coronavirus numbers. They report earnings 5/27 so there is plenty of time to get in on this. I am going to wait until next week to look at this further and see where it is headed. I plan to add this into a reminder so you won't have to remember all by yourselves. You dipshits seem to have trouble with that.

&#x200B;

**SDC;** Last is SmileDirectClub. They are an oral care company (so am I, HMU) that basically makes retainers/braces for fixing your teeth then sends it to you in the mail. What has been a huge craze during this lock down? Self care and bettering yourself. Now here on WSB we do the opposite and develop a gambling addiction because of the immense amount of time we have but a lot of people are actually trying to make themselves better. SmileDirect has partnerships with United Healthcare and Aetna and starting in May will be with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. That means they will have partnerships with more insurance companies bringing in more potential customers and increasing revenue. Earnings are released on 5/13 after hours. They were sitting above $15 before the drop and now are around $8. The[ OP of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf9cr0/your_next_earning_play_for_big_gains_sdc_tldr/) says $8.5c and I agree but you can go a little higher if you want.

&#x200B;

This is one of the first posts I have made where I can say that I honestly believe all of these will pan out. I know I'm going against the grain with CSCO but its a gut feeling I have. Everyone is saying CSCO with have massive gains and how many times do you see ""inverse WSB""? Well I'm inversing it. There are a shit ton of posts about LOGI so if I didn't write enough I'm sure you'll be able to find a reason to invest.

&#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

&#x200B;

**TLDR;** Cisco go up then down like always, Logitech go up, Box go up, SmileDirectClub go up.

**Plays;** CSCO $45+ calls but sell BEFORE earnings come out, CSCO puts around $4 less than the peak on Wednesday, both CSCO plays can have 5/22 expiry. LOGI calls at $55 for 6/19. BOX calls at $18-20 for 6/19. SDC calls at $8.5-9 for 5/22.

But you are making a grave mistake if you think this is a write-off sector like most foolish and Robinhood-level investors.

**$SPG, $MAC, $PEI, $TCO, $SKT, $CBL, $REG, $CDR, $WPG, Etc.**

The top 10 mall holding companies in America are all going to shoot back bigger than before for the following reasons, and the come back will actually be starting as early as next week:

1. Among the top 10 mall holding companies, several of them had already before, or had decided to partner up on ventures during, the virus pandemic. This means that they (the big ones) are watching each others back and balancing themselves out.
2. As other mall holding companies are worth pennies or nearing shutdown **the top 10 are buying up or attempting to close deals on buying up many of the smaller mall holding companies.** Some of which you won't easily find on search and only through some of the companies website blogs directly.
3. This delusion that ***people will be ""scared"" to go to malls is hogwash***. The *political* hoax around the virus aside (not the virus itself), a lot of those twitter users whining and yelling at people on video that they shouldn't be outside and they are killing people in mass hysteria, or that they would take a year or more to go back out their house, aren't the majority of people. Most red states throw this out the window immediately, but even in Blue states ""so called"" many people have already been going to the few businesses that have been open in some of these malls during the peak of the scare. While it won't be everyone **a major number of people will flood back to the malls assuming that the businesses in the mall open along with the mall(They will).**
4. Which goes into this point, businesses in the malls are desperate to open, some have closed up during the pandemic but the ones that haven't, who aren't major corps, aren't going to sit around and lose more money for fun, they are going to be opening along with the malls.
5. Many of the top 10 (heck 15 in this case) indoor and outdoor mall/shopping center holders **recently saw jumps just on announcements of potentially opening up locations across several states.** One got an increase by just saying they would open up 2 locations by next week. This shows there's a heavy dose of hopium that thing will be recovering faster than it likely will, which means that Wall St will rally the more locations open.
6. Large partners will work with the malls to advertise together to pull in more consumers and yes, it will work.
7. Many people need haircuts, new shoes, clothes, suits, entertainment to distract them like games, movies, soundbars, headphones, etc. **The malls will be the FIRST in line to offer every day distractions and essentials** to the people, since the top 10 mll holding companies are ***going to open before many of your street strips will***. While also having social interaction, and a closed (or open if it's outdoor) space to ""hang out"" in and ""relax"", and that's important.

By betting against the malls you are basically doing the same as putting in $200 puts on SPY or $150 puts on DIA or QQQ. ***Doesn't make sense.***

The only ""risk"" is if you bet on smaller mall holding companies, some will make it and shoot up, others will be grabbed in the consolidation. Otherwise, it's free money pretty much 80% guarantee.

Look at the news, Simon property is in the middle of a mall buyout NOW, I'm sure the others that will follow. [Not long ago many of them jumped up due to opening calls.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/28/why-mall-reits-macerich-taubman-tanger-shot-higher.aspx)

 Demand for oil is low and will continue to be low even after we open up. Air travel will remain low for the foreseeable future.

Gamble with options not your 401k. There’s no upside reward in the next 6 months. Take profits and wait to reposition once the dust settles. If I’m wrong, I loose out 10-20% market gain, If I’m right get a discount of 30+%.

CLF is due to report before market open this coming monday. Currently trading at 4.76, hitting it's low point on 4/20 it has been on an upwards trends since.   

Reports are indicating that there were more than several insider  trading activities at Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF), starting from HARLAN M  ANN, who bought 5,000 shares at the price of $4.42 back on Mar 13.  After this action, Rushing now owns 27,090 shares of Cleveland-Cliffs  Inc., valued at $22,100 with the latest closing price.  

Fisher Robert P Jr, the Director of Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., bought  10,000 shares at the value of $4.00 during a trade that took place back  on Mar 12, which means that Fisher Robert P Jr is holding 134,030 shares  at the value of $40,000 based on the most recent closing price.  

 The company has a net profit margin of 14.70% and is more profitable  than the average Steel player. CLF’s asset turnover ratio is 0.58 and  the company has financial leverage of 8.79.

CSCO to announce their earnings on 5/13. Here's the optimal strategy:

* Step 1: Go to CSCO 5/29 options, select the lowest premium possible which is 50c @ $0.06 atm
* Step 2: Buy loads of contracts. Lets assume we buy 80 contracts for $480
* Step 3: CSCO is currently $42.00... Let it climb to $45 until Wednesday 5/13. Ride the IV fluctuations until 5/13
* Step 4: CSCO goes up by a mere 8% to $45 (which is extremely possible given how undervalued it is). The value of your stock is 2.5x your investment, you get $1,250. If it goes up to $46.33, your stock is up 6x times and your return is $2880.
* Step 5: Sell your CSCO calls and take a lil break

2324,DD,A Tale of Two Tendies--How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Read a 10K- Pt 1,320,gfv49n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gfv49n/a_tale_of_two_tendieshow_i_learned_to_stop/,80,1588980147.0,"Hello idiots, it's your friend Duncan here again for my apparently weekly series on how to use math and logic to ~~own the libs~~ justify your reckless financial decisions. You might remember my previous posts telling you to [buy calls on a company that eats the poor for money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8od1g/cacc_subprime_autoloans_are_totally_gonna_go_tits/), and urging you to [hoard gold like some autistic mountain dragon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gcdjeo/dd_gld_stagflation_and_you/). 





For today's installment, I wanted to show use a 10K to understand why the market might price things the way they do. A 10K is a free, publicly available document that Michael Burry said every good investor should read. Obviously, there are no good investors in WSB, but I love shouting uselessly into the void, so here we are. 





A 10K is usually a large document comprised of a bunch of information about a company's risks, financials, direction, and operations. Its a single all encompassing primer on the company and its vision of its future. However, today I am going to focus on one of the most accessible parts: The Balance Sheet. The balance sheet, cash flows, and a few other segments are actually not written by the company, but by an independent auditor who is required to comply with auditing standards called GAAP. This means that while a company can still engage in some fuckery, you can be pretty sure that the balance sheets and cash flow statements are basically true and correct. 





A balance sheet is essentially a snapshot of everything the business owns, and everything in owes. The sheet always appears in balance as **Assets=Liabilities+Equity**   Let take a look at the balance sheet for two companies you are all familiar with: America's two largest chicken tendie manufacturers: Sanderson Farms ($SAFM) and Tyson Foods ($TSN). Both are major players in the livestock/protein agribusiness sector, so why then do we see SAFM trading at around 146 with an insanely high P/E of 100.62. Tyson, in contrast, is trading at 59 with a P/E of 10. Why the hell does the market think Sanderson has 10x the potential of Tyson? Lets look at their balance sheets to find out. 




[Tyson's Balance Sheet is here](https://imgur.com/O9zBuco)




[Sanderson's Balance Sheet is here](https://imgur.com/a/kDI8YvR)




Now, a balance sheet is not a reflection of sales or cash flow, it is a snapshot in time. Lets look at what each major category means:




* Current Assets: This is everything the business owns that is quickly convertible to cash. This is stuff that you could turn into money generally quickly. These are the tendies on your plate(inventories), in your hand (cash), or the ones your mom is walking down the basement stairs with (account receivable)





* Net Property Plant, Equipment: This is obviously the plants, processing machines, offices, computers, and other business stuff they company owns. This is like, the oven, the fridge, the plate, the honey mussy, that all go into making your delicious tendies.





* Goodwill or intangibles. This is things that aren't really....real. Sometimes it is things that really do have a clear value, like a patent on a way to process chicken, or a specific breed of bird. But sometimes it's, more wishy washy, like 'reputation' or 'brand recognition'. If you compare the balance sheets, Tyson argues that it has a ton of intangibles and goodwill, like tens of billions of dollars in goodwill. Ok buddy. Sure you do. In contrast, Sanderson's balance sheet doesn't really need intangibles and brand recognition to prop it up. It lumps those into a small 'other assets' category.  This is like mommy's love for you. I'm sure mommy loves you, but if you are relying on that to balance out your good boy points and tendies, you might have a structural issue. 




* Liabilities. This is an easy one. Current liabilities are the debt that is due this year, and long term debt is everything else. Look at Tyson, if you total it's debts, they are over 50% of assets, and most of that is long term debt. They also have a lot of current liabilities for their cash on hand. If you're an investor, this is a sign that you need to dig deeper. In contrast, Sanderson has few liabilities, and hardly any long term debt. Total liabilities are only about 20% of assets




* Equity. This is the value of shares outstanding. It important to understand Equity is the value of the shares when they were issued times the number of shares issued. It's not the current market cap. You can see, Sanderson hooks shareholders up. Because of the little debt, tons of the company's sweet sweet tendies go straight to shareholder's pockets. No debt servicing here. In contrast, Tyson will need to spend a lot of money to service that debt, leaving less for shareholders.




Now, if you're an investor, which company is better poised to weather the storm of economic uncertainty? Obviously, Sanderson. They can take on debt to finance operations, especially at these historically low interest rates, and once the market stabilizes, they can start buying up the assets of the competitors that have failed. Based on this P/E of 100, the market seems to believe that Sanderson is going to outlast the competition and become the literal Tendie God. 




I would love to recommend a play in all this. Common sense says the market has not fully priced in the risks to Sanderson, and Tyson will struggle to weather the market disruptions to poultry prices, demand etc. However, in this opposite bizzaro dimension, we should all do the opposite of common sense. So calls on Tyson and Sanderson.

Going long LOGI. In January I was buying Webcams and computer accessories Logitech was the **bestselling** manufacturer in **every category**. I checked the same stuff that I bought in January in March and most of them are **sold out** and on back order. Third party sellers were asking $90 for a webcam I paid $30 for. My mouse was $15 but now going for $25. They also own **Blue Microphones** (Blue Yeti and Blue Snowball) **Jaybird** and **Astro Gaming.** Is Logitech expensive? Today it's at the same price as January. A lot of companies are **reimbursing staff for buying telecommunication equipment** such as webcams for zoom, teams, google hangout, .... Logitech had the top 3 bestselling webcams. Even some of their computer speakers are on backorder. 

With schools closing early a lot of guys bought their peripherals for **gaming**. Their gaming products even have their own supreddit r/LogitechG. As we know gaming stocks have been on fire. Even one of the posts making to r/all was a LifeProTip to buy a good webcam to look good for work.

Cyberark is one of the companies announcing earnings next week. They are a priveleged access management security software company, and their stock is way off their all time highs because they had predicted a big drop in profits before COVID hit. But since COVID hit they've put out new software that allows for secure remote work access without needing high performance hardware VPNs. If you look at other companies offering secure remote working solutions they've easily creamed their original earnings projections. Fortinet is a VPN hardware provider and their stock went up 30% after earnings because companies have been buying remote VPN hardware like crazy. If you look at CYBR stock it's been skyrocketing into earnings the last week.

Only real downside to this play is that there isn't a ton of options volume, the only calls with any real volume are all gambles on the 5/15 earnings. But CYBR previously guided very low and original expectations were for decreased income, so it's one of the stocks where I could easily see a big beat on earnings. Might also just be worth holding until earnings since almost all the cybersecurity firms have been pumping hard into earnings after the big beats.

They are worth $165 million. However, their earnings tell us something, they beat expectations. Logitech is poised to do the same. Logitech is not a crappy company, they are swiss and are worth over $8 billion. Now let me tell you why. 

Logitech has grown at a steady rate in recent years. The company focuses on products for PC navigation and video communication and collaboration. Keyboards, mice, webcams, speakers, and many more. The company is poised for growth in all of these areas in this work from home environment and you probably have owned some sort of Logitech product in your lifetime. 

How do you think all these new work from home folks are zooming? Webcams & Headsets. Just look at this article from April “The COVID-19 Pandemic Has Caused A Webcam Shortage, And Street Prices Are Soaring”. That’s all Logitech; they are the maker of some of best webcams on the market. 
https://hothardware.com/news/covid-19-webcam-shortage-prices-skyrocketing

Logitech also owns Astro Gaming, Blue Microphones, Streamlabs, Ultimate Ears, and Jaybird. All peripheral brands that stand to make a killing in this current environment.

Further, Logitech is one of the premier companies in the production of gaming peripherals with its Logitech G lineup. What do you think all those kids are doing at home right now? Gaming. 

Many of their products are sold out on Amazon and they are trending near all time highs on google trends. 

They are poised for an earnings beat for Q1 when they report after market close on Monday.  They will likely do the same, and most likely even better in Q2. However, it will not end after that. You think everyone is just going to head back to work business as usual? No, we won’t. More people will be working from home than ever before. Facebook and Google just announced they are letting employees work from home through the end of the year. Q3 and Q4 will also likely do quite well. 

The company also has $656 million in cash; money it can spend to help accelerate growth this year. 

TL;DR: Buy $LOGI calls now, earnings on Monday after market close. They are poised for rapid growth in this work from home environment and are a much better company than $HEAR. $HEAR is a crappy company that had an earnings beat, $LOGI is a great company that will have an earnings beat.

So what we have here is a undervalued, heavily hit company during the crash which has yet to make it's checkmark recovery like so many other stocks. What's difference?

Well people are now finally realizing how strong the tech sector is, and how valuable remotely-engaged businesses will be in the future. This pandemic just caused a paradigm shift in how humans will work in the future, companies like $CSOD will profit from this immensely in the next 2-4 quarters which investors will EAT UP.

Now let me answer some questions that I frequently see...

> *hurr durrr I saw the executives selling shares?* well yeah no shit, they were about to announce an acquisition which usually tanks share prices short-term. The next time they sold was the actual market crash, who wouldn't?

> *but what if this is another NET?* $CSOD is still significantly down from its share price before the crash and acquisition. Once we see how the new acquisition will help CSOD in the medium-term, institutions will be eating this stock up for its MASSIVE FREE CASH FLOW. Also this is mostly institutional buyers, this ain't a meme stock (except now it is...)

> *how are you sure they beat?* if you take a look at the current expectations for Q1, they are relatively low in a quarter where all of America, and the World was sent into lockdown resulting in a MASSIVE shift to online-based learning, trainings and work. I believe they beat handily and their SABA acquisition models are icing on the cake for the BREAKOUT OF THE CENTURY.

> *is it to late to join the party?* no but you now have to account for IV, don't pick retardly OTM 5/15 calls, stick to 6/19s at strikes $40 or $42.5, maybe $45 for a daytrade.

> *when are you selling?* I bet my short-term livelihood on this play, I can't leave it all on the table and will take some profits EOD Monday. I will be remaining in a $5k-$7.5k long-term play for earnings. Literally I bet my savings on this shit.

I am glad my first $DD has been so profitable for so many, and I hope it continues to pay y'all out, it sure has for me. I can't wait to see what is in store on Monday night. What's next? Find out this weekend on another edition of Baked Morning.

I’m not being a bull ass here or anything like that I am being genuine when I say there is not going to be a rug. 

If you don’t inherently understand the market’s psychology in relation to unemployment, options are not your thing. I have seen some really sad accounts of losses and had conversations with people here wanting to kill themselves etc due to it which really makes me feel fucking horrible in all honesty.

The market looks to the the future not the past and very little if at all the present. Unemployment numbers are high in total yes but overall they are declining week on week. 

Again back to market psychology. The markets decline when there is uncertainty and rise when that uncertainty goes away whether it goes away from a positive answer or a negative answer to the uncertainty at hand I.e. will more people have filed for unemployment? Yes they will. Yes that is bad news, however now we are certain of what we were wondering about because we have a working strategy to combat it.

Example being today had 3 million plus unemployment filings announced, the market on whole acknowledging this has its uncertainty dispelled. Why is it going up though that is horrible news?

It’s because this whole economic period has been one of uncertainty. 

Unemployment is not due to economic short comings or failures like in 2007-2008, the 97’ Asian financial crisis, nor like the uncertainty of post 9-11, its due to a and I can’t stress this enough a deliberate cessation of economic activity by the government to combat a public health crisis. 

It is not the virus that kept people home on whole it is the government enforcing measures to keep people home in an effort to combat the virus.

The government policy to keep people home on unemployment is arguably an incredible success that will financially in history go down as successful. Often times lower wage workers get more than while they were working and that motive has been a success in what it sought to achieve, flattening a rapid nationwide curve rising, and before you say but so many are dying still yes they are and yes they will but imagine if we hadn’t had any lockdowns during the rapid spread like in New York nationwide? 

We have given time to break what could have been an unstoppable shutdown nationwide DUE to purely the virus ravaging the population versus a deliberate economic shutdown to combat the virus.

We might and still will have rising deaths and outbreaks but it will be hotspots and through management strategies we have adopted, coming together as a nation, and the amazing work of researchers/doctors in the medical field we will have a treatment proven to mitigate active infections and eventually a vaccine. We will persevere through this.

Although they have recovered well from their COVID low, $BOX has plenty of room to run and this may finally be the chance for some of you to make a play better than just bending over for an IV crush. **TLDR: $BOX calls**

#Overview

Even amid all of the recent hype for $DBX, $BOX hasn't gotten the love that it deserves. Where $DBX spends most of their time making small money on the consumer front or on limited basic enterprise plans, $BOX focuses on playing with the big money (like the MMs that steal your weekly allowance). To give a bit of background, let's get into the background and then their latest 10-K.

>With our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data
protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations . . .  Our platform enables a broad set of business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers have access to their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.

As a common theme, you'll continue to see this enterprise focus throughout, but it gets better.

>Our go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our cloud content management platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers . . .  We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous . . . We offer nearly 1,500 integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM,
Salesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. 

See some familiar names here? Those are the stocks that you've already missed the boat on. Beyond that, if you take a look at their site, you can look at some of the big names already using Box in their business: Morgan Stanley, GE, Intuit, AstraZeneca, etc. 

Even their CEO himself has been out trying to [tell everyone to hop on for the ride](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/box-ceo-aaron-levie-sees-cloud-growth-during-coronavirus), but hopefully the news coming out of the $DBX call was enough to convince you that it's viable. 

If we get into their financials, you'll see strong revenue growth YoY from about $600M for the year ending 1/31/2019 to $700M on 1/31/2020. Although they have recorded a net loss each year, it's primarily driven by sales and marketing expense (45% revenue and declining YoY). When your product sells itself in this pandemic, that becomes a bit less of an issue. The balance sheet is a bit weak with limited cash and substantial A/R that may be problematic, but given the nature of their customer base and limited leverage, it shouldn't be as big of a concern.

In terms of revenue generation, I'll direct you to their [Enterprise License Agreement](https://cloud.app.box.com/s/xec0gl0gqcgverpn2rw0r4kkzqycdsme). These are 3 year agreements which include implementation and full integration into the Box platform. Over the past couple of months, even a few large organizations signing up for these are going to make it rain tendies, but I'd bet you see massive growth here. Because enterprise customers on broad platform integrations tend to be locked in for a while, it's going to lead to incredibly strong guidance.

#Why now?

$BOX reports earnings on 5/27, so for once you'll have the chance to get in *before* the big run up. As of now, premiums are still low and have plenty of room to run. The best part here is that because $BOX hates their accountants, their fiscal year ends on 1/31, so their quarterly earnings on 5/27 will include actual numbers through 4/30/20. Because of this, they'll have a good 2 months worth of pure COVID gains to showcase. Analysts are estimating about $0.05 EPS, but I'd bet on that being revised up and still beaten. The window may start to close as the market reacts to the $DBX earnings and detail from their conference call, but there's still time to get in tomorrow.

Just trying to collect all ideas for bull case/bear case.  I am biased on the bull side just a disclaimer.  But I will try to provide sources whenever I can.

Anything posted in the comments I will update the list.

&#x200B;

Bull Case

1. The Fed
2. Other countries central bank
   1. [https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/markets-crashed-swiss-national-bank-went-faamg-buying-spree](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/markets-crashed-swiss-national-bank-went-faamg-buying-spree)

4. Pension Funds
5. Election Year
6. Reopening
7. High unemployment with Stimulus Checks
8. High unemployment and casinos are closed
9. FOMO
10. Short Squeeze
11. A lot of Liquidity
12. MM / Big Players loaded up in bottom will not let it crash
13. Vaccine
14. All of the world best mind are focused on this problem
15. V-Shaped Recovery
16. There is no better place to put your money than in the market. Bonds suck. Oil? Forget about it. Most commodities are low. Where shall you put your retirement? Savings? There are threats to that going negative. The market is the only game in town.
17. Volatility never remains this high for very long. We're close to a 30-year record. Declining volatility spikes are always associated with higher prices.

&#x200B;

Bear Case

1. Pesky Valuation / Fundamentals
   1. We haven't paid attention to fundamentals in a long time.
2. Earning will be decreasing and will not return to the 2020 level for 2-3 years
3. Unemployment will remain high
   1. Maybe a good argument for UBI? so stocks should go even higher
4. Trade war with China
   1. Maybe this brings all jobs back to the US so good for the economy. This can be good or bad depending on how you see it.
5. Food Shortages
6. L or U shaped recovery
7. Depression / Recession
   1. Not sure about this one, as Fed will just print more. So stocks will rise even more
8. Waves of Virus
   1. Maybe more stimulus, more Fed Intervention
9. Democrats in 2020
   1. They normally spend even more than Republicans
10. States / Cities Bankruptcy
11. Trump/Pence catches Rona
12. A lot of money sitting on the sideline
13. Highest money market fund. I feel like this can be fuel for the rally for the stairway to heaven.
14. Everyone is bearish / most hated rally
15. Maybe this will keep fueling this rally even more
16. Lots of Retail buying
17. Buffett not buying
18. US Yield Curve is trying to invert. At least the futures are dipping into negative yields.
19. Oil hits rock bottom again, which shows that the current market prices are not indicative of prices in 10 days.

You know what that means? No one knows what this company is going to do after earnings considering the minuscule amount of earnings data that exists. 

They got smashed by the Rona like everyone else combined with some bad news about people suing them and legality issues but who cares right, not like we are long term investors. 

Also, did I mention 53% of the float are shorted so Squeeze potential (Ahem Wayfair), is highly likely if earnings beat,

So will their earnings beat? I have no idea tbh but I do know they have deals with insurance companies now and will be giving good guidance meaning more sales and more $$$. 

What happened over the last few weeks? SDC rallied up to $8 resistance and couldn’t break it, finally broke yesterday verifying a cup and handle formation.

And then people will all panic and realize that we're either back to lockdown or half a million people will die, or it magically ""disappear"". Only then, people are assuming that the market will react.

But the other investors on the other side are just as smart as you. There are probably very few people who think reopening will not cause a rise in infection. The smart money is definitely not that dumb. This is hot potato and the first to leave wins.

This has to happen before you're expecting it, because the smart money has no reason to stay that long if they can leave before it. Why would they? Would you do it? They won't wait for the news they know will come. Hell I bet some of them even control when the media calls it ""second wave"". It's all very arbitrary, calling it waves gives the media the power over public opinion. It's open to interpretation. But call it a second wave and there you go, you have the public primed for a sell sign. That sell sign will come as a scare, to squeeze people to panic sell, not as the trigger to the initial selloff. Prices will be already low when that happens and they will use that to maximize buying. They would want those headlines to come when they can push stocks below their worth, not as a reminder to correct their prices.

A ""second wave"" headline will happen because the media won't be silent over fast increasing case counts. Retail investors will sell on that news. Smart money won't let other investors pull out before the headline comes, if they can maximize their sell before.

So the question, what is the timeline you think this will happen. And then the smartest reaction is to exit this earlier than all people here think.

**So when do you think news will announce ""second wave"" ?**

It's also OK to post ""I don't think there will be a second wave"", or ""second wave won't crash the market, it's priced in"", or ""The market will crash only after we know states reaction to the second wave"". Would you sell on ""second wave"" news?

I'm guessing not more than 2-3 weeks until someone says Texas has a ""second wave"" (A rise in infections, although they never really reduced them anyway).

**EDIT:** Seems like majority here think that ""second wave"" news won't move the markets, not what I expected. Maybe it won't, and you're right. **Can bulls clarify, when they post, that they think a ""second wave"" headlines won't cause a crash?**

I'm trying to understand the reaction. Maybe I'm wrong and there will be no reaction.

EDIT2: Bull for now, but for how long? I mean nobody really expects this to be a smooth ride up, do they? Do you?

EDIT3: I was partially wrong. Seems like ""second wave"" narrative is already in the South Korea news:  [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea-idUSKBN22M028?utm\_source=reddit.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea-idUSKBN22M028?utm_source=reddit.com).

Good run for the bulls! Happy for the rally hope you cash out your tendies in time!

Here is my DD: 


I live in montreal area in quebec canada... I feel it can be compared to any major US city at different scale...

In Quebec province we did a lot of early lockdown and social distancing... bars, school and buisness got closed down really fast... some
Region were completely closed to any outsider...

We’ve been re opening slowly and they just got out with projection on maintaining or easing the lockdown mesures and keep going with reopening...

If we keep the current lockdown statut in the larger montreal area... 6 projections out of 10 = big spike in cases, hospitalisation and death towards july... 

Only 4 projections brings the top into May and no spikes...

This is if we maintain lockdown... 

Even if this is retard land I think you can figure what it means if we keep on with the reopening plan...


TL;DR

60% chances of majors fail at reopening if we stay closed down...

40%chance of success with lockdown

I don’t have the numbers of we re open but I guess the major fail chance is more around 85/90%

As we all know this week was interesting, still climbing up to 300 as deaths top and unemployment goes to the sky. Everyone here is either say V shaped recovery or another leg down. Who knows? Not me. Just thought that this information was interesting. 

I checked ETF fund flows online and this is what I saw

The total outflow/inflow for Spy past two weeks was roughly -5.4 million dollars. I checked other etfs but spy was more active. Now this information only isn't all that great but lets check DIX. 

 Over ⅓ of stock volume trades in the dark. Most of this volume trades at the midpoint of the NBBO, which obscures the direction of the trade, making dark pools' pre- and post-trade data notoriously tricky to interpret. It's all private and the graph is pretty interesting.

The green is SPY and the blue is the dark index buying and selling. And of course when spy crashed look at that buy volume insane right. But look towards the end there's a large sell off and everyday past few days its growing and growing. 

Of course I want to believe spy to 300 but at the same time a strong correction again is not too far out. Just be weary about buying shares and going all in calls like some of you idiots like to do. 

My final prediction: I think we can hit spy 300 in the coming days with some nice rallies but as soon as we get there (give or take a few dollars) I think we can drop to 260 again. I think we cannot hit all time highs again in this kind of environment. Trump wants a strong market right?

# A Bullish Case

Stock market rallies don't simply end because people wake up one day in mass and decide things are over priced.  There's a catalyst.  Lacking a catalyst, assuming current assumptions around the COVID-19 recovery hold true, it's fair to expect the market to work higher.  Sprinkle in FED action, which while down 89% from  it's 3/25 peak, still dumped another $65 billion into the financial system.

Bulls are expecting a quick recovery, and while battered, they haven't been knocked off that position.  There's continued discussion around a vaccine, optimism, stage 2 trials, and numerous companies and universities pursuing it.  We're north of 300k daily tests, and the positive test rate is declining, states are reopening, we got through Easter, and we found remdesivir effective.  P/E is high, but even if you believe that governments are propping equities up, this ponzi scheme still puts US equities at the top, likely to bleed the least and profit the most.  It's not to say a dip wasn't warranted, it was just an over-reaction, hope you enjoyed the ride back to appropriate valuations.

Money right now is easy.  Interest rates are low, and will remain there, maybe even negative, with a FED heavily accommodating of markets.  Liquidity is flowing like rain, banks across the globe are jumping on the QE train.  Shorting the market is shorting the governments ability to continue the rally, and as Buffet says, don't bet against America.

Oh, and guess what, Congress is going to hand everyone more money.

# A Bearish Case

Despite the optimism, the Fed can't create demand.  Consumer spending is not going to come back to where it was.  Millions will remain unemployed, the jobs aren't all coming back.  The idea of a V shaped recovery is ridiculous, even a U shaped recover is irrational.  Given the market expects such a recovery, the theta from news is going to burn bulls, day over day as the recovery doesn't manifest with the expected velocity, gravity of expectations will pull bulls to the ground.

June will see auto delinquencies appear in servicer reports, by end of July extensions 3 month payment extensions run out, auto repossessions will begin again, and the extra unemployment comes to a close.  With September comes standard unemployment insurance running out for initial layoffs, followed by the end of our foreclosure moratorium.

Now imagine we never get a vaccine, it's never proved easy for other SARs diseases, why would this one be any different?  The market hasn't priced in a significant bounce.  States reopening too soon.  The US outside NY/NJ/PA still rising in case counts, and people are sick of being quarantined.  Oh, and good luck getting the US culture to adopt masks.

The market expects COVID to be beaten, when the reality is it needs to be endured.  We've shot most of our stimulus shots, we shot wildly and while some hit, we wasted too much and we will pay in time.  This virus will be with us for years, and so will the impacts.  The world is heading for a recession, and they'll drag the US right down with them.

# My Take

Both cases above have some FUD, but both also have merits.

First, separate Main Street (consumer and production economy) from Wall Street (financial markets), as they are different.  The FED can do wonders for financial markets and in turn Wall Street, but it can't manifest demand.  Congress can.  Stimulus can.

There likely will be another round of stimulus and it'll boost spending, can kicked down the road.  Now it may not come until June, but US equities are strong and as long as the assumption holds, so will the near term impact of it's expected arrival.  Sure, the house of cards may fall in time, but what's going to bring it down?  We lack a clear short term catalyst.

The bulls ate more straw off our camel's back than bears threw on.  States are reopening, there's talk of more stimulus, curves are flattening, positive treatments, vaccine's progressing, and the market is recovering.  The bearish news is the unknown, the whispers in the wind, we'll see in two weeks, wait until September, and the reality that so much is wrong with Main Street, that things can't be this positive with Wall Street.  Can't say they're wrong, but they don't weigh as much.  The market's priced in awful Q2 results, with no guidance, and a market that by it's nature wants to rise, there's little besides whispers to hold it down.

# In Search of a Catalyst

So what could bring what we feel, and the equity market into better alignment?  We need a catalyst, some options:

&#x200B;

* **Consumer Spending** \- Eventually, Wall Street and the financial market is still tied to Main Street and the need for production via demand from a consumption economy.  If unemployment remains low, and wages decrease, you can throw stimulus at it, but spending will drop.  As spending drops, the volume of decline, if severe, can open up a world of hurt for equities as guidance and P/E fall as a reaction.
* **Bankruptcies and Defaults** \- Governments can solve liquidity issues and prop up prices, but good luck fixing the solvency of a business when margins crash due to lack of spending and debts exceed the ability for business (or people) to pay them.  Less hoarding cash by businesses (profitable for financial institutions), more drawing down (cash crunch), more borrowing.  Add to that regulatory tightening for banks post 2008 and minimum levels required will strain them further.  All this can create a rush to hoard cash, which will restart a massive equity outflow.  The challenge is, I don't see this coming near term, even if you believe it is coming.
* **The Dollar** \- The dollar is the standard of the world, but that's not always great, especially when supply causes issues.  When you have massive debt that results in bankruptcies, the money supply starts to dwindle as unemployment ramps, confidence fades, money gets hoarded, and deflation sets in.  This unavailability of dollars is a huge risk.  Currencies are getting crushed by the dollar, negative interest rates could become a trigger of insolvency, an outflow of equities to generate cash, and a massive crash as a result.
* **Significant COVID Resurgence** \- Obviously, anything approaching a country wide lock down in the US will send markets back to their knees.
* **Guidance** \- As the recovery comes, guidance will return.  More than half of Wall Street has pulled guidance, less than a quarter are expected to offer full year guidance, and analysts are flying blind.  As that spigot turns back on, the reality of impacts could be more bearish than expected similar to how we saw with Q1 under-performing.  CEO's tapering FY21 expectations, discussing reduced consumer sentiment, shifts in culture, and a recovery that carries deep into 2022 could be enough to tip companies to truer valuations.
* **Reality** \- As all of the above hit in less severe degrees, there is the sum of parts which becomes significant enough that equities fall, perhaps not at an accelerated pitch, but fall significantly all the same.

None of the above are assured.  There is an ever increasing reality that this market has a bottom.  I struggle to comprehend that at times, and there are so many threads to pull that can crumble things.  But perhaps the FED is able to unwind QE without impact, perhaps the dollar's global position is the strength needed for the US to recover faster despite being hit harder.  Perhaps.

Right now, my sentiment is short term bull.  Medium term uncertain.  Long term bear.  Unclear on if we've found bottom.  This past week has trended bullish across the board.

# The Next Play

The only thing this weekend tells me is: be patient.  It's unclear our direction, even in the near term.  I could make a case in either direction.  This week, is going to be a short term week.  I'll avoid holding overnight, avoid going long (barring very clear signals), and will play the swings (up or down) as my TA dictates.

I like to end ""plays"" when a theme shifts, it helps me avoid chasing losses, so that's what I'm doing and I now consider my prior play done, and failed.  I've allocated another $5000 to a new play, I'll call this play ""Patiently Waiting"".  I expect most positions this week to be smaller, in the $500 to $1000 range, in and out, and I'll be surprised if I fully deploy my allocated capital at one time.

I don't have a planned entry.  I doubt I do anything before noon on Monday, if Monday at all.  I'll create a shorter post once I find my entry, and will track critical TA for the week as well as the profitability of the play in there.

# TLDR

There's a bull case, there's a bear case, the bull's had a stronger week.  Many links, much news.  No clear TA giving confidence in a position, will take short term day trades while waiting for clarity to emerge, will add a post later to track how much I lose.

# Updates

**5/12 @ 7:00 :** I said I'd make a new post when I found a move, but also said I didn't think I'd do much Monday.  I ended up not doing anything Monday.

[Wedge forming](https://preview.redd.it/3sr7hutbfby41.png?width=1549&format=png&auto=webp&s=c657bfeb240f2f50fc808fdbd2729fcf8ea06b9b)

We saw a major wedge break on the 23rd of April.  As it's downside break failed, a new wedge started forming, which lead to my exit from my prior play.  The wedge has continued to hold since.  I hesitate to trade it yet, but it's a converging indicator along with the .618 FIB retracement, you can see the two together formed a strong resistance to the upward movement on the 8th and 11th, forming a double top.  The wedge says it's time to retest the bottom support, and in theory we should see movement downward today into tomorrow.

I'm not planning to play it, but you could enter some 5/15 290p if you see it bounce top of wedge today.  You'd need to exit by tomorrow at latest, exit by EOD may be the best play, really depends on where it goes.

**5/13 @ 7:00 :** Bummer.  Life got in the way of about a 200% gain trade, would have opened around 1.3 and closed north of 4 on a 5/15 290p.  I didn't get to play it.  The wedge was strengthened by yesterday's movement:

[SPY this morning, 200d EMA on 1 HR interval acting as support](https://preview.redd.it/921etrm0iiy41.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd554611e4d43bcd4c23bf0f2c86487dae96e19)

[ES and the same wedge](https://preview.redd.it/37j2asm0iiy41.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=864b4bdea52836a72384cf44ec0554fe8b5bd221)

Above you'll see SPY and a slight dip out of wedge, open will see us right back in.  ES never broke wedge due to lower lows on 5/4.  It's a better than average bet we stay in wedge today, which gives us a 6 point 287 to 293 range.  SPY closes with support at 287 in wedge,  yet on the ES, the wedge supports at 282, truth might be somewhere in the middle.

If we open 286.5 to 287 range, I'll enter a 3-4 contract position of 288c.  Be mindful, everyone thinks the FED buying ETFs is a tailwind, I see it as a short term headwind given the outflow of equities to the newfound safety in those bonds as a result.  But that's a macro view, and this week, I'm intraday.

**5/14 @ 7:00 :** Let's start with unemployment.  The estimate for claims this week is 2.7m, the smallest gain in 8 weeks, but still pushing us to over 35 million unemployed since early March.  Some estimates have \~5m people returning to work in the past few weeks, but the flow is still higher towards layoffs.  They've been button on of late with estimates, I expect them +/- 250k, anything with a 2 in the front isn't going to move the needle.

As to market direction ...

[.5 FIB Supporting](https://preview.redd.it/oirt0bb0qpy41.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e81c4cd9eb1dd9c1ab4342a8347609e2f9e4b64)

Bears couldn't break the .5 FIB, it held back on 5/4 and it held yesterday, though saw 15% more volume this go and was a deeper cut at breaking.  We have had two straight large red days, we bounced off a support line, and are in oversold territory (that indicator flashed literally right as we bounced off the FIB, trended down since).

A really nice bear case would see us retest the FIB, break it, and thus the neckline, forming a really nice head and shoulders from the 4/5 time frame.  I don't see it as likely, but breaking the 280-279 churn sees us down towards 272-273.

[Don't trade this as a prediction, lazily drawn example.](https://preview.redd.it/bcw6hx0aqpy41.png?width=1553&format=png&auto=webp&s=1088fd5b8b6a32731df1099f091e4d4bad9272c6)

A more likely scenario is we track the 5/4 bounce, but don't bounce as high, before regrouping to retest the FIB once more.

[Our rising channel from the bottom.](https://preview.redd.it/fxmxzhoeqpy41.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=549368ea085542a08f604c40696982099b3451e0)

We've been in a rising channel for some time, quickly bounced into the churn zone, decided we were bullish, and started tracking the upper segment with support holding all the while.  Of late we're fading, and there are signs it's time to give our supports a good test.  The natural rise in the channel paired with fading momentum could  cause us to naturally coil for a while before enough energy returns for a strong move.

I'll be watching today, might look to enter a 5/15 283c position, not something that would look to track the full height of the rebound, rather the initial velocity and bounce, which should occur today into AH assuming we confirm that as our direction.

**5/14 @ 7:30 :**  On 5/12 we saw the wedge, and thought it's likely it bounces off the top and test support.  On 5/13 it did just that.  On 5/14 we expected a bounce off the .5 FIB, and that's what we got:

[Blue are yesterday's expectations, green what we got.  Don't trade that second bounce yet.](https://preview.redd.it/tlzyh0jr2xy41.png?width=1547&format=png&auto=webp&s=b31af3c5385d5b59653cee497aea827aab5ea719)

5/4's bounce was 115 points, current was 96.  The 5/4 pullback was 68 points or 54% of bounce, current is 37 points or 39% of bounce (though still forming, assuming 2824 holds as support).  5/4's continuation bounce was 121 points or 105%, let's assume we get 83% of that bounce (same as initial comparatively), that would see us to about 2924.  You'll notice that aligns with my hastily drawn bounce chart yesterday.

If gravity is taking hold, you'd expect our second bounce on the second test of the FIB to be smaller, the second dip could go either way: 

* Smaller: 2824 holds as support.  We got a smaller initial bounce, a smaller still dip, and likely a smaller still second bounce, perhaps towards 286-292 range.
* Bigger: If our second dip breaks 2824, I'd expect us to retest the .5 FIB.  If that were to happen, we're really putting a beating on that FIB level, it's not proving as oversold as it was, and each test weakens it further.  We could bounce right off it, or the really bear case bursts through it before bouncing.

There are a lot of scenarios here.  I can't make a call.  I can say that you can see gravity in the charts.  We weren't as oversold on this FIB test as we were on the 5/4 test.  We didn't rise as high into overbought territory this time before turning back down.  I can see downward momentum building.

[A head and shoulders that I don't quite believe in.](https://preview.redd.it/k0equvqx2xy41.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=173bc36a83e8a9641ea0be72ee4687f0cfc454c5)

There's a weak head and shoulders that strengthens with a downturn.  I don't put much stock in it, but fun to watch anyways.  For whatever reason, I just can't get on board with a really bearish short term outlook.  

[Our general channel](https://preview.redd.it/wgl8ua813xy41.png?width=1551&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c09cbd82c16f651df6d38675333c847d3dd519c)

Instead, my gut tells me we stay in this rising channel, trending towards the middle chop zone.  That leaves the market very sideways, with energy continuing to coil, for what could then break either direction, though which my gut says breaks downward.  Feels like a roller coaster just being released after riding up, yet we're in the front car, and the back car hasn't been set free.

Possible plays: Day trade scalping ... Wait for us to bottom, into calls for rebound ... AAPL calls during rebound ... or given 2824 doesn't seem to have held (for now) go permabear and jump into puts!  I'm probably staying cash today.  If I had the time, I'd wait for the dip to bottom, then day trade scalp the upward momentum until it stalls (which is the same thing I did yesterday).",2020-05-09 23:12:50,-1.0,0.0,0.29604815950920255,-0.23465061349693248

Of these trillions, about 2.5 trillion at most was income given to businesses and individual by Treasury. This is more than 10% of annual GDP should more than fill the hole in GDP by most estimates. The rest was in the form of Fed printing and unforgivable loans. This was to offset the capital flight to safe havens like cash and treasuries and restore liquidity to bond markets. Inadvertently, a portion of this government provided income and Fed printing ended up in stocks. Consensus says that since the amount pumped in as income and loans is greater than the fall in GDP and capital flight to safe havens, the recession is cancelled or there's a Fed put on stocks not specifically doomed or even helped by corona (FAANG, etc).

Note that while stocks have rallied, short term t-bill yields are still falling and long term treasury yields are flat after falling a lot, despite record borrowing by Treasury. Gold is flat since stocks bottomed on March 23rd. Fed futures are expecting negative interest rates. Investment grade bond yields are much lower. All of this means that smart investors expect deflation, not inflation, for several years. This is while the Fed funds rate is already at zero.

Deflation is bad for stocks, good for bonds. It doesn't matter if you own the stock of a perfect monopoly with zero debt. If your money can earn a return as cold hard cash, why would you buy stock of a business that will have lower earnings due to deflation? Yes monopolies have pricing power, but this will diminish if there's deflation and could cause a revenue/income drop. Also, deflation increases the real yield on treasuries/bonds, so stocks make less sense as an investment. So why are stocks not pricing in deflation when every other investment asset is?

Stock investors are stupider and more impulsive than bond investors. This has never been more true than in the current age of instant gratification (social media), investment gamification (investing apps), index investing (blind and constant buying), and an 11 year, 500% stock rally that gave investors confidence in stocks and a FOMO. The trillion dollar question is, how long can all this keep stocks diverging from reality? I think over the next month, as Fed printing slows, government income tapers, and people go back to work, we'll see the top.

Argentina seems to like to default as they do it a lot. The country has debt as percentage of GDP above 90%. Obviously there is no money to pay off that debt and this has been obvious even before the coronavirus. Then Argentina decided to go on an aggressive lockdown for covid, costing the government largely. Recently Argentina has been in talks with its creditors and bond holders about restructuring its debt. The conditions they offered were shit for the bond holders, so no deal was reached. On May 22 they have $500 million payment due. Even before covid was around it was highly unlikely that they were going to pay. Now though, there is basically zero chance they can do anything but default. No one seems to want to save them again.

[https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/08/economy/china-unemployment-intl-hnk/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/08/economy/china-unemployment-intl-hnk/index.html)

\* The full scale of how many people have lost their jobs in the country is hard to capture. Data from Beijing is notoriously opaque, and the official unemployment rate — which only tracks jobless numbers in urban areas — has barely moved beyond 4% to just over 5% for years.

\* But even the official tally has started to register a spike. Unemployment in March was 5.9%, just shy of the record 6.2% reported a month earlier. That would represent more than 27 million people out of work, according to a CNN Business calculation using government data.

""China's unemployment could be seriously understated,"" said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor for the Center of China Studies at the Chinese University of [Hong Kong](http://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/04/economy/hong-kong-q1-gdp-economy-coronavirus/index.html). ""It's unusual they are willing to report that bad data. Given the government often massages the figures, the real situation must be worse.""

\*  Beijing's data, after all, does not include people in rural communities or a large number of the 290 million migrant workers who work in construction, manufacturing and other low paying but vital activities. If those migrants are included, as many as 80 million people could have been out of work at the end of March, according to an article co-authored last month by Zhang Bin, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a think tank run by the government.

Other experts say that the 80 million figure is likely much closer to reality. It's also a lot more disturbing — it would mean that nearly 10% of people in China who are supposed to be employed are actually out of work, according to economists at Société Générale.

\* in 2015. Beijing at that time was offering subsidies and other forms of financial support to startups, which encouraged entrepreneurs to create millions of new companies. The unemployment rate that year was about 5%.

\* Even before the coronavirus outbreak, Wang said offers were drying up. The tech startups he worked at in 2018 and 2019 ran out of cash as Beijing tightened regulations on how they could obtain investment.

But now he says finding work is almost impossible. He and his friends have started lowering their expectations, and some of them aren't even sure whether they can stay in Beijing.

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.” 

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental  for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector,  more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers.  Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and  tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were. 

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision. 

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps. 

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp.  The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day. 

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit. 

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without  knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehaman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street. 

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis. 

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. The Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailout Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

In past green days, the yield recovered with the market, but this week the yield has barely budged, accompanied with ridiculously low volume in basically all stocks/indices.  Today the market rallied nearly 2% and the 10 year and 30 years are basically the same % increase wise. 

Could this simply be a result of QE? Or simply the bond yield literally being unable to rise above that?  Or (everybody knew where this was heading) could it mean that big boys are bidding up the market while simultaneously buying treasury bonds expecting to sell off?

What I find interesting most on this analysis how there hasn't been a single distribution day since April 28th and how there was about 50% distribution days on both markets just before the major downturn around March 9th. Anyways if anyone has any more feedback about this analysis or info they would like to share about distribution days I would welcome that conversation.

Getting to the point of my post, **The Trend is Down....**

Compiling data of closing points every two weeks from the start of [2020](https://gyazo.com/101c16d2eb2a5a8e70f764ac34c36c6b), each of the indexes are down-trending for the year & Bitcoin as well. Now the graphs which I've attached here hold little/next to no weight when looking for an indication on what position to take/when, but it's a piece of the puzzle when talking about the outlook for 2020.

Another piece to the puzzle, since that 'judgement day' post (referencing something I posted 3 weeks ago on r/investing, would link but that got removed along with my post on april 19th warning the clowns in there that they shouldn't be buying into USO/investing in oil lmfao); we have seen 6 green trading days & 9 red trading days on the S&P, signaling to me that investors are favoring selling in the 280-295 range much more so than buying. While the S&P has rallied above 290 on the back of NASDAQ/MAGA movement, it hasn't broken into/through this range with any conviction at all, it's actually forming a head and shoulder top in the trading range - [seen here](https://gyazo.com/f02fd040f5523c644d6fe60306f0721a).

Further Dissecting the [SPY](https://gyazo.com/0d2716ad2d863bdae7bac638fc901df5) \- Price action is currently bouncing between the 50 & 200 EMA (EMA is quite significant as it weighs the price around volume traded, while SMA's simply calculate based on closing price day-to-day.) Friday's close placed us right under the 200 EMA (I view it as the ceiling currently.) and would point to downside come open market on monday (tomorrow.) \*At the time of this post, futures opened with a gap down to 291 and has bounced back up to test this 2940 resistance. Will they push it above for a proper bull break before US markets open? Perhaps, maybe the bulls get their 300 touch; However, I see the indicators hinting to downside more convincing atm.\*

Further DD of 'leading indicators' when looking at ST trends (DXY, BTC, XLF) -

The Financial sector has been getting absolutely SLAMMED, like seriously, its almost worse than the beatdowns the small-caps have been receiving. Imo, this questionable performance from the financial sector says A LOT when considering investor uncertainty at the moment. On the four hour, this sector is currently bouncing between the 50 & 200 EMA's as they pinch closer together; which you could say is bullish, however, any and all uptrends on the chart have been broken & it leaves the financials out in no mans land (bearish.) It's currently pressed against it's 'LT' downtrend line (Established in early January after COVID was 'open public info'.) and made a double top rejection off of 23.70.

[BTC](https://gyazo.com/2ddf2dd544a4635c2fa0b3d5de2b3c8a)\- Touched 10k & crashed over 10% this weekend. As seen in the first screenshot I attached, BTC has been trading almost side by side with the general markets (Most reflective when looking at the S&P or NASDAQ.) I believe this to be a leading indicator of downside ahead similarly to how it was a leading indicator in mid-march when gauging 'how much downside was left in the markets.'

[DXY](https://gyazo.com/fe947858ac8059f62ef92e13efe49c7b) \- Key when considering short term deflation/inflation of assets. Has broken out above an immense resistance & has been confirming this as new support (people are hoarding cash, much more than they're spending, contrary to popular belief; I wont comment much tho, because tracking the DXY can get complex quick. We're taking it at face value here.) Watch for another major breakout (Would signify people hoarding cash, most likely stocks are getting liquidated at that same time. Comparing the timeline of the last breakout, March 9th- March 20th, this was the same timeline which the S&P took its major leg down from 300-220.)

I'm not talking about the recent rise in equity prices during April, which was also driven by increased liquidity in combination with [retail investors bringing valuations to euphoria-level prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd1t2g/dddd_the_rise_of_buy_the_dip_retail_investors_and/); this has been going on since at least 2010. Today, I'll be going in-depth about how we go into this bubble in asset prices, fueled by ten years of unsustainable increases in liquidity from the Fed, as well as everything you've never wanted to know about what liquidity is, how rich people in corporations store wealth, how money works, how securities are valued, the Monetarist school of economic thought, inflation, with a sprinkle of differential equations! By the time you're done reading this, you'll be ready to pass the economics portion of your next CFA level III exam.

**What “Liquidity” means**

We all know that since the stock market started crashing, the Fed has lowered their interest rates and started the regime of “infinite quantitative easing”. This was in an effort to provide liquidity to effectively everyone. What does this all mean, and how does this help the economy, why did the stock market go up because of this, and how long can this liquidity pumping last?

First, what is liquidity? It’s the availability of liquid assets in an organization or economy. A liquid asset is an asset that is easily convertible to cash at the market price. An easy way to look at the liquidity of an asset is looking at the bid-ask spread of it. A treasury bond, for example, is very liquid and widely considered to be a “cash equivalent”, or in other words, the same as cash. In fact, for organizations / people that hold a vast amount of wealth, they would probably hold more of their wealth in treasuries than cash (or bank deposits). We’ll go over that later. In contrast, a house is fairly illiquid. It might take months to find a buyer, may have high transaction fees if you go through an agent, and the fair value of it is uncertain.

Okay, so how does the Fed’s policies affect liquidity? In general, a central bank will either be adopting an expansionary or contractionary monetary policy, meaning a goal of increasing or decreasing the supply of “money” in the system. A key distinction here to point out is that “money” does not necessarily mean “cash”. There’s actually several official definitions and calculations of what counts as “money”, but all of them go with the notion of anything that can be considered “cash equivalents”, like bank deposits. This means that the Fed doesn’t actually need to physically print more money (i.e. increasing M0) to increase the money supply and have the same effect. To help explain this, let’s go through how money is created and the most common mechanisms the Fed uses to increase the money supply.

**How the Fed creates liquidity**

Most money is created by banks in the form of debt. Banks create money by accepting deposits from customers, and leveraging that money to create loans. Suppose you decide to deposit $1000 into his checking account. By law, up until last month when the Fed decided to take extreme measures to combat deflation, banks were required to hold a certain fraction of their deposits in cash or deposits in the bank’s own account in the Fed, who acts as the bank for banks. The idea is that on average, depositors won’t be withdrawing most of their money from their accounts anytime soon, so instead of having the liquidity sit idly at the bank or the Fed, it can be recycled back into the economy through loans and other financial securities, which can also become a revenue source for the bank.

How does the Fed play into this? They can influence the overnight rate, which is the interest rate banks lend money to each other overnight to make sure they meet their reserve requirements. In other words, banks with a surplus of money over their legally required reserve requirement will lend money to banks with a shortage at that rate. This will naturally affect the amount of loans banks give and act as a floor to the interest rate available to consumers, as it wouldn’t make sense for banks to make loans at a lower interest rate than what they would receive from loaning to other banks on an overnight basis. The Fed influences this rate by giving banks an option to borrow from them directly, usually at a premium of the “target rate”, as a last resort to prevent a liquidity crunch. In this case, the bank will need to put up collateral, usually Treasury Securities (although this has also changed recently), for this overnight loan. In other words, the bank sells an acceptable collateral to the Fed with the agreement that the bank will repurchase that collateral for a slightly higher price the next day. This mechanism is called a “repurchase agreement” or repo and is the primary way the Fed indirectly controls the liquidity in the economy. What can the Fed do after this rate reaches zero (aside from going to negative rates like Japan / Europe)?

The other way the Fed can influence the money supply is by performing Open Market Operations, where they directly buy US treasuries for cash; this is also known as expanding the Fed’s balance sheet. Recently, this has expanded to many other things, including junk bonds. Technically, the Fed itself doesn’t directly buy these bonds, since they’re not able to take on credit risk. Instead, the Fed created a taxpayer-funded Special Purpose Vehicle, whom it then lends money to for bond purchases. So when Congress passed the CARES Act, it provided the Fed $454 billion, which they used to effectively establish an organization that will use the Fed to lever it up to $4 Trillion to buy whatever debt instruments they want, and lose up to $454 billion. How does this affect things?

**Where the real money is**

We’ve all heard that there’s massive wealth inequality in the United States, with the top 1% holding over 40% of all wealth in 2019. Now, imagine if you were managing $1 Billion of assets, how would you store them? Doing what most normal people do, depositing into a bank account is dumb for many reasons. Other than the fact that you’re only guaranteed $100,000 from FDIC per account if your bank happens to be insolvent, your $1 Billion is going to lose about $20 Million in real value due to inflation. So what do they store their wealth in? Stocks, Bonds (Fixed Income) and some Cash / Cash Equivalents (mostly Treasuries).

[Assets held by high net worth individuals](https://preview.redd.it/giay0bkrs0y41.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=9303e269eb0ecffdfb6720a18f23f4147c86077e)

Fixed Income and Treasuries are also how most public companies also store their extra capital. Let’s look at Apple’s balance sheet in their most recent 10-K as an example.

[Apple Balance Sheet, Fiscal Year 2019](https://preview.redd.it/giqbm2kvs0y41.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=23348fddbe93647b3a68ad3a503ef2ec7f51058d)

[Breakdown of Cash & Securities owned by Apple](https://preview.redd.it/llgic7b1t0y41.png?width=1566&format=png&auto=webp&s=263912a0d423bee4eca7886d8456ae1c930ff413)

Out of Apple’s $339 Billion of assets in 2019, they had $205 Billion of them in financial instruments. Of that amount, the relevant parts are that they had $12 Billion in actual cash, $50 Billion in government securities, and $85 Billion in corporate bonds. Also they own $14 Billion of other people’s mortgages, cool.

So, what happens when a bunch of businesses are now forced to shut operations, your BBB-rated $F or $M bond gets downgraded, and you’re no longer sure which businesses will or won’t go bankrupt? Or what if you’re a business that suddenly finds yourself needing cash to pay your expenses in the next few months? You sell your them, and that’s exactly what everyone did in March. Cash and Cash Equivalents are now King.

[DXY, Daily](https://preview.redd.it/6w0p6ji7t0y41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=acf6b1d9a2822754bf1964150482c927bdce6a6b)

Everyone is dumping their bonds, some of which aren’t even getting any bids when being sold, even briefly going into negative territory, and $DXY (representing the value of USD compared to other reserve currencies) skyrockets. Add on the fact that a substantial amount of non-US debt is denominated in US dollars, meaning governments and corporations around the world are trying to get their hands on USD to cover their debt payments with reduced revenue. The skyrocketing corporate bond yields make it virtually impossible for companies, even the ones with strong balance sheets, to raise their much-needed cash to survive through bond issuance.

This is where the Fed steps in. Their job is to prevent deflation at all costs, and a strengthening $DXY is a sign that this might happen since that means it’s a lot cheaper to import things. In fact we saw a 0.4% decline in CPI in March, although the collapse of oil prices also probably affected it. The Fed then uses their SPV to buy bonds to stabilize the market and give investors confidence that they won’t be the bag holders. They also use something called swap lines with foreign central banks to improve liquidity between currencies to help with the foreign debt problem. This causes bond prices to go back up (and yields to go back down), bailing out everyone that would have lost money from the crash.

Now here’s the kicker - this barely helps with fighting against deflation. Inflation is measured by comparing the weighted average of prices for a basket of goods, representing the things an average consumer buys in a given year, and does not include financial assets. Buying bonds and treasuries and lowering interest rates will only indirectly prevent deflation by preventing a complete freeze in lending by banks, and maybe by the wealth effect (i.e. becoming poorer will lead rich people to spend less money). Instead, what we see is another sort of inflation - the inflation of asset prices.

**How liquidity inflated asset prices**

The Fed pumping liquidity into the system is nothing new. Since the 1980s, the Fed funds rate has been steadily decreasing towards zero, causing treasury and bond yields to follow it.

[AAA bond yields, 1980 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/gsu1y289t0y41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f01b3e02e3f023a3476b26779a075b7de91dab8)

Investing is all about risk over reward. In general, the US treasury is considered to be the safest possible investment (risk free), and the yield of a 3-month US Treasury bill is the floor of all yields (risk free rate). In theory, all other investments are riskier and thus have a higher reward for that risk. Thus, as the risk free rate goes down, investors now need to take on more risk to have the same reward, and financial instruments with the same risk will have lower rewards (yields), bringing down bond yields. This also means that equities that carry the same risk will also have lower “yields”.

Now, “yield” in equities is a bit complicated. One way to calculate them is to just use the dividend yield. However, in the past few years companies realized it’ll be more tax-advantaged to do stock buybacks instead of paying dividends. So, although not exactly the same concept, earnings over price would be the best metric to look at the equivalent of equity “yields”, or the reward investors will accept for the risk of investing in the stock.

[Shiller PE Ratio](https://preview.redd.it/zqalpygct0y41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c2483551371cb818c62d52964cd3a76171324fa)

There’s a lot more variation here because “risk” and “reward” in equities is much more variable and harder to assess compared to fixed income, but we can see that P/E ratios have been on the rise since the 1980s, meaning investors are generally willing to take on a lower reward for the same amount of risk in the stock market.

How much longer can this last? Fed funds rates are already effectively stuck near zero; even in the “booming” economy that we’ve had the past decade the Fed was barely able to raise the repo rate past 2% before the stock market started crashing in late 2018 and was never able to meaningfully unwind their balance sheet from all the quantitative easing they did in the Great Recession. Now they’ve put their liquidity injection program on steroids with infinite QE. They’ve reduced the risk of corporate bonds by saying they will be the bag holder if things go bad.

The key takeaway here is that increased liquidity from the Fed causes inflation of asset prices. Hopefully, this isn’t new news to anyone, but now you hopefully understand why this happens.

**How We Got Here - Inflation Targeting and Monetarism**

So how did we get here? Why has the Fed pumped so much liquidity to the economy? My own personal opinion is that this bubble was caused by the Fed’s indiscriminate inflation targeting. Since 2012, the Federal Reserve’s primary objective has been to have a target of a 2% inflation rate, an increase from the 1.5% target inflation from the early 2000s until 2012. The whole idea of inflation targeting is actually pretty new, with it being first discussed by the Fed in 1994, where it was debated extensively for multiple years on whether or not it would be a good idea, and it didn’t really get implemented until the early 2000s. Before then, the Fed just aimed for “price stability”.

[Changes in CPI, 1950 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/eic2d66gt0y41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef8760a52f4bc415434dee37d25f421e124ee77)

Okay, so what causes inflation, and how is it calculated? The inflation rate is usually calculated by measuring the changes in the CPI, or Consumer Price Index. CPI is an indexed weighted average basket of prices for goods and services that an average American household purchased for a given year. There’s also core CPI, which is the same concept but removes fuel and food from the equation, since they tend to be volatile.

There’s many theories out there about what drives inflation. One of the most popular ones out there, and the one I personally believe, is Quantity Theory of Money. The origin of QTM is actually pretty ancient, first proposed by the mathematician Copernicus back in 1517, and has been accepted by economists ranging from Milton Friedman, Keynes, and even Karl Marx, although they all disagreed on which variable in the equation should be emphasized. Keynes’ believed that it was determined by aggregate demand (Q), Marx believed it was determined by the amount of goods in circulation (also Q), and the Monetarist’s view led by Friedman, is that what determines inflation is the quantity of money in circulation (M), and can be controlled by the Fed. In other words, the Keynesian approach to controlling the economy was to focus on aggregate demand, usually through fiscal stimulus, while the Monetarist approach is to focus on the money supply.

**Velocity of Money**

In its mathematical form, let’s look at the simplified Equation of Exchange.

[Equation of Exchange](https://preview.redd.it/708gy9qit0y41.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=1850047ed13610aa8809b2d20d2555ce23844803)

In this equation,

M is the total nominal amount of money supply in the economy. As mentioned above “money” can mean different things, but in here let’s say it’s the M2 money supply, which is all cash, checking and savings deposits and money market securities.

V is the velocity of the M2 money supply, which is the average amount of times a dollar is used in a transaction in a time period within the economy.

P is the price level, which is basically CPI

Q is the real value of all expenditures in an economy. This is basically the same as GDP.

To see how this relates to inflation, we’re going to need to look at how the price changes with respect to time. Time to add some calculus to this to look at the first time-derivative of P.

[Hand-written derivation of inflation from the Equation of Exchange](https://preview.redd.it/vp4u1m9kt0y41.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddc9c317ceb6f47a2538ab05e6e32bc107865f2d)

I hand-wrote this because I was too lazy to write this up on LaTeX. The usually cited version of this is to pretend velocity money is constant and not deal with calculus by using approximations for when changes are very small. This results in ΔP = ΔM – ΔY, which is what you’ll see in most ECON101 textbooks. The problem with this assumption is that velocity of money is not constant and this will not be reflected in long-term effects since this approximation only works for very small changes and neglects feedback loops.

Okay, so let’s look at my handwritten equation. If you can’t read math, what it says is that the inflation rate

* Increases with the rate of change in the money supply
* Increases with the rate of change in the velocity of money
* Decreases with the rate of change in the GDP
* Higher velocity of money amplifies the effects of changes in money supply
* Higher money supply amplifies the effects of changes in money velocity
* Higher price levels amplifies the effects of changes in GDP
* Decreases in GDP amplifies all changes in inflation

Now, let’s take a look from the Fed’s perspective. This probably isn’t that reflective of the Fed’s actual decision making process but it’s one way of seeing how everything relates to each other, and all the other models (eg. IS-LM, AD-AS) basically lead towards a similar conclusion. The Fed wants to have a fixed inflation rate no matter what. It’s extremely hard for both the Fed and federal government to control behaviors of consumers, and how quickly they spend money they receive, so velocity of money is sort of just a given. GDP can somewhat be controlled by the governments through fiscal stimulus, by using deficits to fuel economic growth, although this isn’t sustainable if there’s no fundamental reason for increased productivity. [As I mentioned previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fzmlsv/spy_1125_150p/), this is probably the case and what we’ve been looking at for the past decade was a period of debt-fueled economic growth, and we would have seen stagnation if the government hadn't grown deficits in the past decade.

From the Fed’s perspective the only thing it can control is money supply, but this usually needs to be done slowly and carefully. Dramatic changes in prices will amplify the effects of any GDP changes due to inflation, causing even more dramatic changes to price levels as well as decreased GDP due to economic uncertainty from unpredictable price levels - hyperinflation, or deflationary spiral. You also don’t want to suddenly massively increase your money supply because this will amplify any effects increased money velocity has on inflation. Increased inflation will also lead to less savings and more people spending money as soon as they receive it. Also hyperinflation. Mathematically, the equation stated above is a first-order differential equation on every variable, meaning it’s full of positive feedback - specifically positive feedback loops.

[Real GDP, 1984 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ncaghdltt0y41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5abdab667c39b30836232a1759540d45e2b74453)

[Velocity of Money, 1960 - 2020](https://preview.redd.it/3b2snjyvt0y41.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=69c47fe5e8e0f639afd43cbc9da009107d7e6b4c)

So what do we see happening since 2000?

* Slightly declining secular GDP growth
* A dramatic drop in the velocity of money from the 1997 peak of 2.2 per quarter to 1.3 in Q12020. The falling velocity of money is most likely attributed by the slow rise in income inequality in North America, and since rich people have a lower propensity to consume (i.e. every extra dollar, they will more likely invest / save it rather then spend it on consumption), this reduced the number of times dollars get spent.

Clearly, the inflationary effects of slower GDP growth is far exceeded by reduced velocity of money. This is actually usually the case, and it’s why you usually see deflation rather than inflation for most stagnating developed economies (eg. Europe and Japan). Because of positive feedback loops, when this happens, it’s very hard to escape and is called a deflationary spiral. To combat the deflationary pressure and maintain the same inflation rate as the 1990s, the only thing the Fed can do is increase monetary supply, using the mechanisms described.

Up until 2008, the primary mechanism was lowering interest rates, which inflates the money supply through lending. The new money supply, through loans, would be mostly issued for consumption, like a mortgage to buy a new house or a new car loan to buy a car. This will have the added benefit of increasing velocity of money because this new money supply is recycled into the economy. After 2008, the Fed had to find a new mechanism, with interest rates being permanently too close to zero to have any meaningful impact on the money supply to actually help anything, especially since most Fed board members think that negative interest rates are a bad idea. With quantitative easing, direct purchases of treasuries artificially lowers the yields of treasuries and makes bonds and equities relatively more attractive when looking at risk / reward, inflating prices of those securities. We’ve effectively reached 0% yield on the risk-free-rate during the last crisis, so the next logical step for the Fed was to buy other securities, like commercial paper and now bonds. Except, as shown earlier, the biggest holders of treasuries and bonds were actually corporations and high-net-worth individuals, who compared to regular people have a much lower propensity to consume, and would not at all address the lowering velocity of money. It also leads towards higher wealth inequality, as it inflates prices of those securities, and all other financial assets which are concentrated at the top corporations and individuals, which tends to be bad for velocity of money. In simplified terms, the increase in money supply goes towards the people who already held a lot of wealth. This is probably why we’re seeing a steep drop-off of money velocity after 2008, even after the economy has recovered.

**Velocity of Money in an Pandemic**

A pandemic and lockdown brings a whole new level of challenges in maintaining this delicate balance. Suddenly, all the variables are changing rapidly with the economic shock. Although we don’t have definitive data on this yet, it’s pretty clear that this lockdown will see a sudden and dramatic decrease in money changing hands. At the same time, we’re going to see the biggest sudden drop in GDP in history - at the scale of the Great Depression but occurring in the span of months. To add to the shit show, oil prices are in an absolute mess, adding even more downwards pressure to CPI. The Fed is now trying to fine tune this economic machine to balance. The positive feedback loops mean that if they’re not able to expand the supply of money enough, we’ll quickly see a deflationary spiral. If they do too much, we quickly get into hyperinflation. As the world’s reserve currency, and having the vast majority of countries in the world being short dollars, with debt denominated in USD, it’ll be virtually impossible to see hyperinflation.

The Fed has pretty much maxed out on everything they could have possibly done to keep inflation at 2% by increasing the money supply using tools they’re allowed to use. Interest rates and the risk free rate have been near 0% since 2008, and bond yields are already at unrealistic levels for the amount of risk they have, resulting in a skyrocketing increase in equities. Since none of these actually address the velocity of money issue, which has likely sharply decreased since March, we’re probably going to head towards a deflationary spiral. What does this mean for equity prices? We’ve seen this exact scenario play out in Japan during the 1990s and parts of Europe in the 2010s, and counterintuitively, we see an L shaped recovery economically and a collapse of equity prices. I already talked about this extensively so you can read that if you want to know more about it.

**What was my point again (TLDR)?**

Wow that was long. Let’s go over everything in here

* Money is usually created from banks issuing credit.
* Fed influences credit issuance with overnight repo rates and open market operations
* HNWIs and corporations store a lot of wealth in treasuries and bonds as a vehicle to preserve wealth.
* Everyone was trying to get their hands on dollars in March, especially internationally where many debts are denominated in USD
* Fed’s actions lowers the “risk free rate”, which is used in valuations of securities. This changes the risk / reward desired by investors for other securities and causes those prices to increase. They’ve artificially deflated yields (i.e. reward / risk) of bonds in March, inflating equity prices even more.
* Since the 2000s, the Fed has started targeting a specific interest rate.
* Velocity of money, caused by increasing wealth inequality in individuals and businesses in the US, has been steadily decreasing since the 2000s.
* Decreased money velocity, with stagnating GDP, means the Fed has to increase the money supply with liquidity to keep inflation at the desired level. Positive feedback loops means that they need an increasing amount of liquidity to have the same effect.
* Increasing liquidity through money supply increases wealth inequality and decreases velocity of money.
* Even though this has been happening since the 2000s, a lockdown just accelerates this process.
* Fed probably can’t do anything else to stop a deflationary spiral, which is where we’re headed.
* Japan and parts of Europe had something similar happen a few years ago, and it didn’t end up well.
* L-shaped recovery and a stock market collapse

**I just want to know if I should buy SPY calls or puts**

See my [short term thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9h9np/an_indepth_look_into_the_next_few_weeks/) from two weeks ago (tldr - SPY will go sideways between 293 - 274 for a few weeks), and [last week's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gd1t2g/dddd_the_rise_of_buy_the_dip_retail_investors_and/), where I talked about the declining momentum of the bullish sentiment (tldr - 293 (+- 2%) was the top, going to see a reversal soon). I'll also be updating this post with my live thoughts / moves for this week, for those who care and like reading about what other people do. For this week overall, I'm looking for re-confirmation of my thesis with the following events happening

1. SPY going back down after reaching 293 (+- 2%)
2. SPY falling past 278, which is the 50% Fib level where we reversed off over a week ago. This will open up 274 and form a double-top bearish signal.
3. Daily MACD crossover

EDITS - Live thoughts

5/10 10:30PM - /ES at 2945, near the upper limit allowed by my thesis. 15m and 1h are overbought on RSI, so expecting it to not move past this level and move back down to \~2930 when market opens tomorrow.

5/11 2AM - /ES back right underneath 2930 after reaching 2950 (200D MA). Looking good for my short-term thesis so far

5/11 Market Open - SPY opened at 290, reversing off of 293 from Friday. /ES hourly has a bearish MACD on 1H so we might so SPY slowly go down below 289 today. If that happens my short-term thesis is re-confirmed.

5/11 1PM - SPY back at 293. 15m 1h 5h MACD are all bullish for SPY, although 15m RSI is getting towards oversold. Getting a bit nervous about my thesis, but we'll have more conclusive ideas about where the trend is heading during power hour today.

5/11 3:50PM - Still at 293. Basically moved sideways. 1D, 4H, and 1H MACD is bullish but 15M is bearish. Clearly 293-295 is really strong resistance. Thesis still not confirmed, and technicals make it look like we might move towards the upside. Still holding all my bearish positions but tomorrow will tell us what the trend will be for the next few weeks. > 295 = we're headed to at least 300 and my thesis is disproved. < 289 = we're heading to 278 at least, if we have a daily MACD crossover during that time then we're probably not seeing 293 again.

5/11 4PM - Closed right below 292.50. Saw a massive candle at 3:59PM bringing us back down with with a nominal value of $85M; some big fund is calling this the top and started dumping their holdings - very bearish. Futures might be red tonight

5/12 12AM - /ES back at 290, bearish reversal right at 293 again, reconfirming resistance level. 1H and 4H MACD is back to bearish. I don't think we'll be retesting 293 anytime soon. Might see a red day tomorrow; if that happens it re-confirms the thesis from two weeks ago that 293 was going to be the top.

5/12 Market Open - Opened right back at 293. Massive pump overnight, supposedly because of higher oil prices. More waiting.

5/12 1:30PM - Same story as the past few days. Price bouncing between strong resistance at 293, and what looks like strong support at 290. 1H MACD in SPY crossed over this morning, indicating that bears are winning this fight during the daytime too. Still holding and waiting for thesis confirmation.

5/12 3:50 - At 288. Thesis reconfirmed. Next stop is the 50% Fib retracement (278 - 279), expecting to see that by Friday

5/12 Market Close - Closed at around 286.50. Volume and price action at the last few minutes was insane, institutional money is starting to pull out (expecting DIX to fall today). After hours SPY is already at 285. Bears have won this battle, crash I talked about last week has started.

5/12 6PM - /ES is now extremely oversold on 1H. It's going to need to consolidate (i.e. move sideways, go up a bit) overnight before it can go down even more sustainably. It looks like we've gotten a MACD crossover in both 1H, 4H, and 1D charts on /ES. The 1D MACD crossover is VERY significant and means that the next month will be controlled by the bears, similar to how a MACD cross-over in late March meant bulls control April.

[\/ES Daily](https://preview.redd.it/05ulf6owtey41.png?width=2098&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e5baefa870acb14111d891c496a1dc34d3e6d00)

[Bearish MACD crossover](https://preview.redd.it/oohs0bz5tey41.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=82af42c4092a0eff75df6fc2dbcd7947c261fa11)

This means that we're probably going to also see a bearish MACD crossover in SPY tomorrow as well, unless futures miraculously recover overnight. Look at when the last time the red line was above the blue line. This is going to be a huge signal to all traders and institutions to get out.

5/13 2AM - 1hr RSI is back to reasonable levels and can start going down again on /ES. If we open below 285, which is what it looks like will happen tomorrow, we would have gapped down below the 285 support level and have a trading range of 278 - 284 for tomorrow.

5/13 Market Open - Interesting market open, SPY was trading the opposite direction of /ES for a while. 285 was a key level that bears needed to gap-down below for bears to control the day. That didn't quite happen. Also, 1H RSI is getting towards oversold, and 15m is very oversold. Might see a slightly bullish or sideways day today as price needs to consolidate. 1D MACD also crossed over, so we might see that have a bearish effect on prices since that will be a strong signal to alot of traders, institutions, and algos. I have part 3) of my list needed to confirm my thesis checked.

Big news headline today is Powell coming out and saying some very bearish things. Basically saying we're still not out of trouble yet, can still see an economic depression, and Congress needs to pass a stage 4 stimulus. This can be a signal that the Fed's out of bullets and now it's up to Congress to pass fiscal stimulus.

5/13 Noon - Looks like selling action has resumed after a bit of consolidation this morning. Very bearish as many funds are now going to want to exit after the MACD crossover, and Powell's comments driving fear about the state of the economy. Could see bottom of the range (278) by end of day if this sentiment keeps up despite oversold RSI in 1H and 15M

5/13 3:20PM - Power Hour: Currently sitting around 279.50. Bearish sentiment is so strong that it didn't care the oversold RSI at 15m and 1h through the entire day. We'll probably need to get to 278 before seeing any rebound. Expecting a close around the bottom of the trading range I had today (i.e. 278).

If anyone's bored and wanna laugh at something, watch Dave Portney's stream. He's a perfect representation of retail sentiment and what you should be inversing

5/13 3:50PM - Alot of people asking where we'll be at tomorrow. This one's harder to tell. On one side we see hella bearish sentiment as institutional money starts pulling out because of 1D MACD crossover. On the other side, 1H RSI has been oversold the entire day. Need this to go back to not oversold for me to be confident that we'll see another leg down. More likely than not we'll see a small green day tomorrow. Will need to see how futures act tonight to confirm. My strategy is to exit half my bearish positions at 274-278 and look for another entry. If we gap down that entire range, I'll hold.

5/13 Market Close - Made a mistake at my 3:20PM post. Looked closely and turns out we actually hit the 50% fib, exactly at 278.96 before rebounding. Going to probably be seeing consolidation tomorrow (278-285) again, followed by another drop on Friday maybe reaching 274 and checking all 3 things listed needed to confirm my short-term thesis. Again, for reasons mentioned above this prediction's way less certain especially because we already touched the 50% retracement and got a hard nope from it.

5/13 7PM - RSI in /ES is no longer oversold on any time frame and sufficiently recovered enough to drop lower. 1H MACD is about to cross again back to bullish. This will probably be rejected, and /ES is going to drop overnight again. We might not see that consolidation I mentioned earlier and instead gap down for SPY tomorrow. We'll find out in a few hours.

5/13 4AM - Bullish 1H MACD on /ES. Consolidation it is. Trading range for tomorrow 285 - 279. Much less confident about this one though.

5/14 Market Open - Opened right at 50% retracement. Might see consolidation today. Bearish sentiment still strong and alot of volume during so far so could still break through today depending on how this first hour goes. If we go below 278 in the next few min. 274-278.

5/14 9:50AM - Ok called it wrong from futures. Broke 278. Bearish sentiment is stronger than I expected. We're going to 274 today. All parts of my thesis is now re-confirmed and we have a double top pattern formed. Next week will be bloody.

5/14 11:20AM - That 278 break might have been a fake-out. Bulls are back in control. Bearish sentiment is strong but short term is turning bullish, with 15m chart back to bullish. We needed consolidation because RSI was oversold in 1H, and that was needed before another drop down. It's back out of oversold territory, so there's room to go to 274 now.

2412,Discussion,Trading strats that yield consistent profits without you being bullish or bearish,117,ghcbe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcbe4/trading_strats_that_yield_consistent_profits/,75,1589182805.0,"Edit: lots of ppl arent happy with the lack of degeneracy of this strat, so just yolo on pcg calls for september 20 strike. Good OI and volume. I will post separately on pcg tmrw

I see a lot of posts here about how we’re headed for a lower leg or a higher leg etc, but honestly, no one fucking knows and your sorry ass won’t be able to time it with puts. Even if there’s the next leg down, consider that your timing would need to be impeccable. 

So instead, consider the following strategies:
Write put credits on aapl and msft a month out, with vxx call debits that are due to expire at the same date. The otm vxx call debits would serve as a perfect hedge in case aapl and msft fall. I specifically chose these two tickers because I like both companies, but you can also pick other tech leaders such as fb etc. Basically, do it with a variety of tech stocks that are leading the market. Alternatively, you can just go with qqq put credits hedged with vxx call debits if you only wanna thing about two tickers. 

Write iron condors on GLD and SLV: this is understated. For instance, between each opex period (historically), SLV on average moves between around 0.7 dollars. That means if you write a condor on SLV on May 18 for June 19 that is 2 point wide from the current price, you’ll have an incredibly likely chance that this trade will go through with you realizing the full profit. 
As for GLD, write biweekly condors 5 point wide from current price and those typically have an incredible chance of success, especially if you write it in the middle of two opex dates (may 1 for may 15 was when I wrote GLD 166/164, 155.5/153.5). The theta burn on GLD options is best in a two week period. 

And finally, another strategy for a hedge is place OTM call debits on TLT for each opex that you write the put credits on. This would be similar to the strategy with vxx. Both sets of strats are perfect, but I personally like vxx more since TLT is prone to mass liquidation events like the one we saw in March.

So basically, stop thinking that you’ll be able to time the market with ur retarded technical analysis or looking at volumes on puts. A lot of put volume is just 1-2% of a fund’s money for a multibillion dollar long. The 50 cent trader (ruffer capital) put those trades on to protect their net long assets, which included companies such as Disney. In the end, they just broke even since the vxx options provided a cushion for all the loss in their equities. Most people who consistently make money do it without having to predict market direction.",2020-05-11 03:40:05,-1.0,0.4404,-0.09135178571428573,-0.21698392857142856

2417,DD,A guide to SEC regulation for start-ups and small corporations,31,ghakba,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghakba/a_guide_to_sec_regulation_for_startups_and_small/,14,1589176797.0,"https://preview.redd.it/y3ks04pwg0y41.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e56203299a57da581e441849c6b42d6971ccc01

During the 2008 crisis Uber, Airbnb, and other unicorns were created. This is some general registration advice for the future generation of unicorns being created during this crisis.

There are several securities registration exemptions that small corporations / start-ups can use depending on which one best fits the needs of the corporation. Using a securities registration exemption can help reduce some of the legal and accounting costs compared to a typical public offering of a security. The pros and cons of the following exemptions will be discussed in detail: Regulation A+ (Tier 1 and Tier 2), Regulation D (rules 504, 506(b), and 506(c)), Regulation Crowdfunding, and Intrastate Crowdfunding (rules 147 and 147a). The main differences between the exemptions are:

* How much companies can raise under each (offering limit)
* Regulatory oversight
   * Filing requirements
   * Disclosure requirements
* Legal and accounting costs of the offering
* Who companies can solicit their offering to and who is eligible to invest
* Whether or not state regulatory laws are preempted
* Resale of securities

Regulation A is a securities registration exemption that has two tiers. For a 12-month period, the offering limit is $20 million or less for Tier 1 and $50 million or less for Tier 2. Offering under $20 million can elect to register the securities under either Tier. Under both Tier 1 and Tier 2, the company issuing the shares (issuer) must file an offering statement on Form 1-A with the SEC. This includes offering materials, two years of financial statements and an exit report. An issuer can only accept payment for the sale of its securities once its offering statement is qualified by the staff at the SEC. This SEC qualification requirement will still result in hefty filing and legal fees. General solicitation is permitted (you can freely advertise and talk about the advertising), and there are no restrictions on the subsequent resale of the securities offering. In addition, non-accredited investors are eligible investors.

There are relatively few differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 besides the offering limits. For Tier 1 offerings, in addition to filing Form 1-A with the SEC for review and qualification, state securities regulators will likely also review and qualify required offering materials. Companies offering securities under Tier 1 do not have ongoing reporting requirements other than a final report on Form 1-Z on the status of the offering and are subject to state regulation known as “blue sky” laws. There are no investment limits under Tier 1. Unlike Tier 1, offerings made under Tier 2 have slightly more stringent reporting requirements including ongoing annual and semi-annual reports after the offering is closed. Tier 2 offerings are not subject “blue sky” laws because federal law preempts state securities regulation. Under Tier 2, non-accredited investors are subject to certain investment limits. Although securities exempted under Regulation A are far less complicated and costly than an initial public offering (IPO), this can be a lengthy and expensive process for start-ups. Regulation A is primarily used to help growth companies raise money from non-accredited investors in a “mini-IPO” style offering as a potential alternative to institutional capital.

Regulation D is another set of securities registration exemption governed by Rules 504 and 506. Offerings under Rule 504 are limited to 5 million or less within a 12-month period, and anyone can invest in the offering. Exemptions under Rule 506 have no offering limits and is also preempts state securities law. Rule 506(c) only allows accredited investors, and Rule 506(b) allows for a maximum of 35 sophisticated non-accredited investors. For Regulation D exemptions, issuers must file Form D within 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering, and the resale of the securities is restricted. Under 506(b), additional information is required for sales to non-accredited investors. Unlike Regulation A, Regulation D exemptions do not have to wait for qualification to accept payment. The main difference between Regulation D exemptions is that general solicitation (advertising) is allowed under Rule 506(c), only in limited circumstances under Rule 504, and not permitted under Rule 506(b). Start-ups generally prefer Regulation D for its relatively lower cost and fast turnaround.",2020-05-11 01:59:57,0.9895,0.0,-0.0022756097560975744,0.3290747967479675

This rally was driven by Institutions/Brokers in tandem with the Federal Reserve by taking advantage of all the bearish outlook post-March. They saw the opportunity in our dumbasses desiring a complete economic fallout and an ever greater Great Depression. All they had to do is push the market up and watch the naive Bears capitulate.

I've seen a few posts mention WSB is starting to turn Bullish, which I agree. It's hard for the retail investor/autist to not want to be a Bull especially since the big boys fucked them over and they stupidly jumped in to a Bear position at the end of March playing catch-up (FOMO really). 

Once everyone is talking about DOW 30,000 or SPY 400 or NASDAQ 10,000(FOMO in the opposite direction), the Institutions and Brokers will know exactly what to do. They're just waiting for our money to present itself for the taking by accumulating in one direction again. They need to cover their losses too!

My advice is just to wait. Opportunities will present themselves over time. Perhaps don't look at the stock markets all together and try to find specific sectors/commodities that have long term potential.

TLDR: You'll probably go bust (i.e. SPY 1000 C 5/15). Also the mini discussion by u/JimCramerSober and I at the bottom is very insightful on this situation. He did not deserve to get downvoted into oblivion.

$LOGI

https://www.tradingview.com/x/lYyDVU8H

As you can see the multi year trendline going up to this top. We have crazy sold out products across the board, this thing can moon to heaven. Looking at the closer timeframes though, picture is supported, but cautious.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/6RKKwcuI

Huge ascending triangle with a break. Wait for earnings and we can see it go up crazy or down harder. I personally see it more to the upside. Volume spiking into earnings . I see this as bullish , take it as you will. If it dies though, it has many levels to go down.

Edit on LOGI: There can be a selloff tomorrow. If you want to be cheeky with a pre earnings play, buy at 9:30 ish, sell at 12 or after. I bet you make money :D 

ZM also a great play off LOGI going up

$CAKE 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/7eDMVGNZ

Very interesting levels with VERY high volume to focus on DURING these lows. Volume is heavy, and it is finally breaking upwards. Looks like it will pass this next test and go big. That is my focus for this upcoming move, will be looking to accumulate.

I will update this as we go forward, but with news of reopening and you bet ya 99999% customer growth will moon this shit to the top.

Long at any point.

https://www.tradingview.com/x/oyD7xfav/ 

There is a broader ascending channel we might bounce off of, but we broke into that descending channel which I expect us to at LEAST hit the midpoint of.

$HD

https://www.tradingview.com/i/Zk951opc/

Earnings coming up, will likely run up into earnings but I can see a pullback this week. 
At top of range but can breakthrough, keys to look at. It is at Top of BB band and has usually respected that. Healthy pullback very likely. Thing is though, post pullback, I believe we approach that 239 range and beat it. If we break, which is often what is occurring with HD , we likely go further and test ATH . Will follow up on this when the time comes. Check out the strength in this stock! Wait till pullback or set a buying area, I say between that buy zone I placed to begin accumulation.

NEW!

$CSCO

https://www.tradingview.com/x/iiU2Iap7/

CSCO - Not really that bullish but I can see a strong earnings week. CSCO had a bullish engulfing last week, but has a lower high and a lower low. Very interesting, I say buy into earnings and then possibly just will bomb earnings regardless of expected gains.

$SBUX

https://www.tradingview.com/x/eX8TvHaC/

SBUX looks great here, fibs on two timeframes showing a big break up looking to occur. Big problem that you notice is many lower highs and lower lows (BA, SBUX, etc.). I believe SBUX looks to move upward, has had solid volume and project Make America Open Again will bring in some newspiece to have ears perk up. Be careful though, lower highs and lower lows makes it look not so great. 

$DIS

https://www.tradingview.com/i/XGDUr5WT/

Has a lot of room to climb but next level is 116~. Can set an alert for the 113 break as 116 should have little trouble being broken. Volume growing here and sentiment is higher. They also survived a pretty horrible earnings so their value must be a bit higher. It broke into a strong fib level on Friday and closed above. Let's see what happens tomorrow but I'd be placing a bet on DIS soon myself.

$WDAY in depth

https://www.tradingview.com/x/3xFkSolA/

WDAY has earnings coming up and can see a large run up. May 28, 2020 is earnings, quite some time till then. Might cool down after the run up last week from Twilio but here are the key levels.

It just bounced off .618 Fib, and can pull back to 160 and 155. If 155 holds on strong volume, that signals accumulation to me. I'd say that if so, you can see a large move upwards back to 166 if not higher. After 166 comes 172 also near that 200 day MA. If it breaks above that, the bullish trend will resume and you can see 181, 201 breakouts into higher as we move into earnings. Take it a step at a time.

Layers downward, if 155 breaks you can look for a potential short up to 144. It would be a drastic move as we have see each dip below 150 get bought, but it is not out of the realm of possibility. When it hits and breaks 144 though, that would look at a major trend continuation with rejection of all MAs, and it can be a short to 130, 120.56 and then even 108.54 if visiting the March lows. RSI moving quite high on the daily but it is not oversold per say. V Interesting.

On the weekly, higher highs and higher lows consistently. 

$TAK - Requested

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/qnKC8Gi9/

not gonna go too in depth but it respected mid BB, volume picked up last two days and is dwarfing the sellers. Weekly looks quite shit though, lower lows and lower highs by a large margin since last week, but it did respect .618. On Daily I'd say next move is 18.02 with the test of MAs. If it beats? I'd say next is 18.75. If it breaks this .618 though... could freefall to 16.42.

Monthly actually looks more bullish though, could see this rise heavily. Broke multi year downward trend. This is one I'd focus on levels with and maybe get some leaps vs weekly trades.


$LOW nother quickie


LOW looks nuts

https://www.tradingview.com/x/PA0dthl9/

broke all MA's and mid BB. Might retest 108 though, but i'd look into buying on that mid bb support hold as this shit can moon to 126. calls. Earnings next week, premiums large but can run up large into those levels. Lets see what happens.


Might post more just please request any!

The question is all about timing. If you sold when SPX was near the bottom, you’d be massively screwed. 

The fundamentals are bad. Unemployment figures are rising. Many companies have slashed a ton of their profits. Even though the economy is about to re-open, the impact of this on the stock market hasn’t been felt yet and the effects will last a long time. 

The truth is that this drop never happened because of COVID in the first place. It happened because of companies being overvalued and inflated resulting in an eventual collapse. COVID was just a trigger and those fundamentals are still in play. Just two years ago, nearly half of unicorns overstated their valuations, and it got much worse last year and this year: https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/the-vc-bubble-is-going-to-burst-51553077853. The VC bubble still hasn’t popped yet. 

Now, why do I think it is finally time that we drop now, and why do I think we drop this fast? Why do I think this is not just another one of those “Haha it’s going to crash” posts we’ve seen over the last two months? It’s simple. Retail volume has been washed out and reached a peak last week. You can see this through aggregate order flow on stocks most traded by retail such as TSLA (which will drop the hardest). You can see this through the number of people holding stocks like that on Robinhood which has the most retail volume. The influx of retail traders reaching a peak during a rise or during a drop (which occurred at low 220s) is generally indicative of a top or bottom in case of a downtrend. 

When retail volume peaks in a market where the fundamentals are telling the opposite story, you go short, and you go bigly short.

This being said I want to make a simple purely economic point for those who obviously never heard about this word: 

The Fed cannot prop up the market with cash for a long period of recession, no matters it is the one of stocks, oil, pork futures (to cite this piece of art we saw a few days ago) or whatever else by injecting money in it. 

This is simple economy, the last few big financial crisis were caused by either: 

- an offer shock, where offer falls (e.g. oil price is suddenly sky-high) causing a raise in prices so people having still the same amount of money they buy less, so the activity falls

- a demand shock, where -guess what- demand falls (e.g. when people anticipate lower income) causing prices to fall so producing is less profitable, so activity also falls

Our corona crisis is both a demand and an offer shock, so the activity is absolutely dying for both reasons at the same time, which is extremely rare and grave.

Then, you can do whatever you want, a fall in activity will create a vicious cycle which is the recession cycle : 

Less activity -> more unemployment -> less income -> fewer purchases -> less activity ...etc

Notice that we already entered it. 

These are extremely basic economics, and this cycle is how a housing bubble popping in the US can cause a systemic collapse 2 years later in Greece, it’s just what links everything together.

The point is don’t think we will be out of this after we beat the ‘rona, you cannot cancel the cycle with cash, it can last only after very long years even without any other bad event happening, so it is not a question of the ‘rona being beaten fast or not, the problem is very much deeper. 

So the US stock market can of course be pumped with cash, but it cannot escape the global recession making balance sheets looking like balance shit for ever. After months, maybe years it falls in every scenario, it’s just how recession works and the history of economy since people are trading, you think Trump is the first to artificially pump the market ? 

I am not a basic bear and I do hold stocks to surf the wave, but it is a golden retard thing to think the recession can be “canceled” in the US, when it’s just simple and global chain reaction.",2020-05-10 22:00:31,-0.9998,-0.4215,0.15705856164383558,-0.42141381278538814

Here are my problems with bull case for calls. He is desperate to make cars. He will spend millions building and acquiring the resources for the next location. Building a factory that technically advanced will take time. Building permits will take time to get approved. This is a bluff. There is no way he can build a factory in a few weeks, I can’t see California letting him open in the foreseeable future especially if the the bear flu lock down persists.

The market doesn't seem to know what to do with either of these companies.   Both are significantly down from their pre-rona highs.  I'm a high grade idiot, so I don't know what to do with them either, but a dimly formed idea has made it's way into my mind.

Scenario 1.  Shitshow.

The bears are right.  Half of small business BK, social distancing is restablished after a brief, orgasmic rush to socialize in the next few weeks by mouth agape Karens and Tactical Butterball Gun Rapists in the US drive new Rona cases through the roof, surviving companies, looking to save money, let go of their leases.  Office workers can work from home for the foreseeable future so office space is a logical place to cut costs.  A new WFH paradigm emerges among the white collar glass, commercial real estate values completely eat shit. Malls, already on the ropes from a decade of online shopping, become ghost towns.


Scenario Two. - Everybody was over reacting.

Antibody testing becomes reliable and widespread, ultimate death rate turns out to be .5%. 40% of people are asymptomatic.  Old fucks still have to stay inside, but for everyone else, it's playtime.  People rush back outside to lick each other in their exuberance. Both $SPG (malls) and $BX (office space) rise to pre rona levels.

Oil still has large moves in the near future, but, who cares which way it goes? Straddles on SCO. NFA, just what I am doing with my personal trump bucks.***

If you look at my post from last weekend, you will see 6 points that I am following currently. 1 point is the June expiration of WTI oil. I don't have time to update everything this weekend, maybe I will this week. The background framework is all coming from Macrovoices, and their slidedeck is linked here: https://www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/3670-bigpicture-trading-chart-book-may-7-2020/file

***Background:*** The massive drop in demand for oil (shutdown for CV) caused a glut due to the time required for an industry to react (to finally make a costly shut-in decision). The May WTI oil contract went negative in April due to a limited volume of speculative traders who remained in the market until just before expiration, and who found themselves with no free (re: non-reserved) storage. Negative prices ensued. This negative pricing was one of many signals to oil producers that they must shut in. A resolution was also needed to assist with the short term excess oil, which resulted in tankers being called on for floating storage -> limited supply = price skyrocketed. 

***What happens next depends on your view on the data, which you can review on your own. Two conclusions:***

***A. Oil Bulls:*** We have shut in enough wells, have limited oil build, increased usage + near-term further increased usage is coming. This means, floating storage is no longer as in demand as it once was, and tankers, even having a great quarter or two or four (if they got booked out for the next 6-18 months) will not scream higher. The short term economics become less important compared to the long term trend in tankers, which was not great. Massive dividends this year? This signals the company has nowhere they would invest which would bring a greater benefit to investors. Even in a depression / lockdown environment, do we really think oil demand will stay -30 to -40% below average 2019 usage? And if so, do we really think oil producers wouldn't / won't shut in their wells, rather than sell into a market with such depressed pricing? Oil prices will go higher due to the resolution of the short-term issues stemming from the initial response to the corona virus + the Russian and Saudi oil tiff. Speculators have been limited from the leading month contracts by their brokers, reducing the risk of a large price shift at expiration. USO has been neutered and isn't acting as a roll-over whale anymore. 

***B. Oil Bears:*** We are seeing misleading indicators and we still have a major problem approaching. Oil producers did not react quick enough to the market signal, and we have a glut of oil still flowing into Cushing, OK. Oil tankers as floating storage are still needed and will be for the forseeable future. The rate of flows into Cushing is not continuing at the previous elevated pace, due to an approach to working capacity limiting the rate of fill + alternative storage being sought. Producers cannot shut-in their wells due to bankruptcy concerns, and the government has already intervened by signaling they will bail out the industry. If the government is bailing them out, the risk has just decreased massively, leading to a push to continue producing, rather than shutting off the money supply. Further, since many of these producers have already sold their oil before they pull it out of the ground, they are not incentivized to solve the storage issue. The oil is the problem of the trader at the other end of the contract. The Texas Railroad Commission has not acted to reduce production, which may have helped pricing elevate. Additionally, the companies weighing a V-shaped recovery, meaning the demand increases they see right now will only keep going up, are completely wrong. No faith in the Trump administration + CV = further lockdown, or, consumer behavior is changed so greatly, that oil demand will never catch up to 2019 levels.

The move I am examining is SCO (Inverse oil ETF), for both perspectives. Here are a few plays:

***A. Oil Bull***

1. Low Risk - SCO Call Credit Spreads - Now, low risk is all relative, but a nice credit spread (When IV is as high as it is ~150) would benefit from a further regression to the mean (~50) + oil price continuing to recover. If we wind up in a low-movement situation, you still collect premium on theta decay.

2. Medium Risk - SCO Put Debit Spreads - Same idea as above, but with greater max returns. You are now fighting IV, but, there is still a long way left for SCO to drop if oil climbs back to 30, 40, 50. 

3. JTTT Risk - Far OTM FD Puts on the notion that the economy will restart quicker than we can produce (it takes a long time to bring capacity back after you shut it off). This skyrocketing in oil prices would mean a cratering of SCO.


***B. Oil Bear:***

1. Low Risk - SCO Shares - averaging into a position starting Monday and going through Wednesday, expecting fireworks during the June WTI contract expiration. Taking profits as early as Friday 15th / Monday 18th depending on movement. May hold through the next several weeks if it seems we will lockdown again. If there is limited movement, exiting as appropriate.:

2. Medium Risk - looking at another drop in oil going through the contract expiration and / or news of further lockdown (bzw. further near term demand reduction). Call Debit Spreads.

3. JTTT Risk - Far OTM FD Calls on the notion that the economy is fucked and demand will remain low on further lockdowns + oil producers have not reduced production enough, and a contract expiration event will lead to negative prices again. 

***C. Playing Volatility:***

1. Looking back two months (March) we see an IV spike due to the Saudi / Russia Oil Crisis. Looking back one month, we see the May WTI contract expiration (IV went to 400). We can build out a straddle, if we think the market is going to come to make a big move at some point soon.

SCO is not super high volume on options, but there is enough reactivity to pricing changes of oil that I find this ETF worth creating plays for. Remember this when you look at strange dates + strikes -> Don't build something out that looks amazing on a calculator, only to find yourself stuck. Find expiration dates with higher volume, and round strike prices to ensure someone out there will buy it from you once you've juiced it.",2020-05-10 19:50:02,-0.9998,-0.128,0.41750113636363634,-0.23676628787878795

1.	I always ask myself, if I had the option's value in cash, would I still buy the option? If the answer is yes, I hold even tho I'm up 1700%. If no, I sell even at -95%.

2.	Stop losses could help too. Always be within your personal risk tolerance.

3.	Only buy options u believe in, think for yourself, write down why you're buying an option and question your assumptions frequently.

4.	Always listen to valid arguments from people who oppose your positions.

5.	Have an acceptable risk profile and never jack yourself to the tits, always keep some cash so you can DCA your options.

6.	Look at the greeks carefully and buy options with low IV, low theta, high delta and acceptable gamma.

7.	Realize that weeklies and holding through earnings is pure gambling and treat them as such.

8.	Always hedge a little bit, if you’re bullish just a few VXX calls and cash will be enough to bounce back if the market doesn’t go your way.

TL;DR along with positions at the bottom. 
 


Here are there last 3 years revenues 

JD annual revenue for 2019 was $82.865B, a 23.31% increase from 2018.

JD annual revenue for 2018 was $67.198B, a 20.67% increase from 2017.

JD annual revenue for 2017 was $55.689B, a 48.64% increase from 2016


Here is a Quote about JD not being as affected by Corona 

""But unlike Alibaba, competing Chinese e-commerce company JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) does not rely on outside logistics companies to deliver its packages. Instead, it owns a complete logistics company, JD Logistics. With JD Logistics of course prioritizing the deliveries of JD’s orders, I think that a much higher percentage of JD’s orders will be delivered within a reasonable time than those of Alibaba.
Meanwhile, JD is using drones and robots to deliver products to areas that have been hit hard by the new virus. I did not see any evidence suggesting that Alibaba has been able to adopt a similar strategy. Given these dynamics, I’m convinced that JD’s results will be much less affected by the new virus than those of Alibaba."" - https://investorplace.com/2020/02/jd-com-is-still-a-better-pick-than-alibaba-stock/amp/

JD is also almost exclusively Chinese based. And China opened up almost two months ago now, giving them a huge head start for their upcoming earnings. 

Their expected eps is -.13 per share... Their stock didn't tank with covid. Their business didn't seem to suffer relative to the market. In fact, with their own logistics and drones, they stood better than they could have hoped for. 

Finally, announced today was their cloud based block chain as a service option.

I'm not entirely sure how the last part will affect them, if at all going into Friday's earnings, but further ease and integration for their services can't hurt, imo.

Again buy at your own risk, but good luck and godspeed

TL;DR JD stock is undervalued and they aren't well known yet as they are still seen second fiddle to baba.

More information will be presented on the 5/29 readout. We have adjusted our positions.

**Summary:** Allogene is a \~$4B market cap clinical stage biotech company developing allogeneic (‘off the shelf’) CAR-T therapies for hematologic cancers and solid tumor indications. Allogene was founded in 2018 by Arie Belldegrun and David Chang, who previously led Kite Pharma to the Yescarta approval and an $11.9 B acquisition by Gilead. While the current high price point presents risks, 2020 will be a critical year for Allogene with multiple early-stage readouts: this presents an opportunity to ride several key value inflection points over the next 6 - 12 months

**Key Takeaways**

* There is a lot to like about the experience the Allogene team brings to the table and the promise of their platform to address the clinical and commercial shortcomings of current marketed CAR-T therapies
* Allogene plans to initiate an abbreviated P1 trial for ALLO-501A in 2Q20 to confirm the results of the ALLO-501 P1 ALPHA trial, results for which will be presented this month at ASCO, prior to potentially advancing ALLO-501A to pivotal P2 development
* If the lead program in NHL (ALLO-501/ALLO-501A) is successful, that represents in the range of 100% upside using Kite Pharma, another CAR-T company, as an analogue
* Kite Pharma was valued at $8.4B prior to the Gilead acquisition with a filed BLA in NHL for Yescarta, double what Allogene is trading at today: given a high PTRS for Allogene’s program in NHL (rationale outlined below), this represents directionally where we would expect Allogene’s value to land in the future
* However, current market cap of >$4 B constrains achievable upside versus the downside risk if near-term value clinical catalysts go against our expectation

*We are taking a modest (1 - 2% of portfolio) position ahead of the two key clinical readouts on 5/13 and 5/29 given our expectation for positive P1 results for ALLO-501 (ALPHA trial) and the 2Q20 initiation of P1/P2 ALPHA2 trial for ALLO-501A based on the following:*

* Strong preliminary P1 safety and efficacy data was presented in 2018 by for UCART19 in ALL, which is the same molecular design as ALLO-501
* ALLO-501/ALLO-501A target CD-19 in NHL patients, which is the same target as the approved CAR-T’s Kymriah and Yescarta in an overlapping patient population (DLBCL, a subtype of NHL), defraying clinical risk
* Allogene will be taking the dose-finding learnings from the ALPHA trial into the ALPHA2 trials for ALLO-501A, the next-generation construct and P2 candidate in NHL, a switchover that has been planned since before the ALPHA trial was initiated
* In an earnings call on 05/06, Allogene CEO David Chang indicated that the abbreviated P1 portion of ALPHA2 is on track to begin 2Q20, ahead of a potential pivotal P2 portion
* However, the current price point is somewhat overvalued, and thus does not support us taking a larger position given the potential downside is substantial and potential gains partially already baked in

**Key Stock Drivers:**

* ***High unmet clinical need:*** substantial need for accessible and efficacious therapies remains in NHL & other hematological malignancies given limited options for r/r patients and the time-consuming and burdensome process required for current CAR-Ts
* ***‘Off the shelf’ CAR-T therapies address shortcomings of current CAR-Ts***\*\*:\*\* the approach would theoretically mitigate the manufacturing issues that continue to drag down the commercial potential of and patient access to existing autologous CAR-T’s
* ***Several critical near-term inflection points in 2020:*** ASCO poster abstract covering initial P1 data for ALLO-501 in r/r NHL (ALPHA trial) will be released on 05/13, with further data including additional patients presented on 5/29. These data will support the ALPHA2 P1 and potential pivotal P2 trial for ALLO-501A, their next-generation construct for NHL. Initial P1 data for ALLO-715 in r/r MM (UNIVERSAL trial) remains on track for 4Q20 despite impact of COVID-19
* ***Experienced leadership team with track record of rapid development and regulatory success in cell therapy:*** CEO David Chang and Executive Chairman Arie Belldegrun were formerly CMO and CEO of Kite Pharma, respectively, and led Yescarta, one of two CAR-T’s on market today, to FDA priority review prior to acquisition by Gilead for $11.9 B (29.4% premium over market close prior to announcement)
* ***Clinical programs focus largely on proven targets:*** ALLO-501/ALLO-501A and UCART19 are anti-CD19 therapies, which is the same target as the approved autologous CAR-Ts Yescarta and Kymriah, which somewhat de-risks these programs. Additional targets in development include BCMA for MM (ALLO-715, including in combination with nirogacestat in collaboration with SpringWorks)
* ***Preliminary UCART19 data offers additional validation of platform:*** preliminary pooled data from P1 trials in ALL indicated that 14/17 (82%) of patients receiving an anti-CD52 antibody during lymphodepletion achieved a complete response (CR/CRi). The anti-CD52 antibody serves to protect the allogeneic CAR-T’s from being cleared by the body’s immune system. ALLO-501, ALLO-501A, and ALLO-715 are all dosed with ALLO-647, Allogene’s internally developed anti-CD52 antibody, creating a “window of persistence” during which the allogeneic CAR-T’s can exert their therapeutic effect

**Key Stock Risks:**

* ***Value of pipeline programs heavily interdependent:*** Given the clinical stage therapies are rooted in the same technology platform, any issues that emerge from the ALPHA or UNIVERSAL trials could feasibly drag down the value of the entire pipeline. On the flipside, however, positive preliminary ALPHA data would likely have the reverse effect of increasing PTRS across the clinical-stage portfolio
* ***Stock currently trading at / near 52 week high:*** While Allogene traded in the $18 - 20 range for the latter part of March, the price has rebounded steadily upwards and scraped against an all-time high today on just-shy of average volume, reflecting both the overall market rebound and likely enthusiasm from the market for the impending ASCO data. This suggests there is significant immediate downside if the data falls short of expectations on 5/13 and 5/29
* ***Long-term competitive risk is substantial:*** While Allogene is a leader in the field, the next-generation CAR-T space is fairly crowded. In addition, Fate Therapeutics (market cap: $2.3 B) has a pipeline of iPSC-derived natural killer and T cell therapies for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors reaching the clinic. While Allogene is exploring the iPSC space as mentioned above, Fate Tx has reached the clinic already, which may provide them with a leg-up in the long-run

I’m the guy who called out TGT ( Target ) last week and look WHERE it’s at now? Even the mods didn’t believe me and took down the post. I hope target has earned you guys many tendies, if you want proof, look at my post history.

Now to begin with the LOW dd. It will most likely get to $115-$120 by the end of this week. It’s on a very strong uptrend, it also has been very stable with minimal dips throughout each day the past week. What we can see is that earnings is coming up, 5/20. The IV right now isn’t that bad on the calls for 5/15 or 5/22. Surely as we get closer, I’m fairly certain we will see a surge in IV and stock price based on what’s going on. Keep in mind, LOWES has been packed, I always drive everyday of the week to go to work and the parking lot is packed. It’s like HD, which also has earnings come up. But that’s for another discussion.
LOWES has been killing it as people have nothing else to do but work on home improvements to their home. As we also know WSB will mention this stock a lot like NET and etc. it’s your best bet to get in now. Remember, you’re not supposed to hold through earnings to secure your profit but SELL BEFORE.

For anyone who missed it, the US unemployment rate as of last week was 14 percent or 20.5 million people. Crikey! This time last year we were at 50-year lows, in three months we managed to wipe out all the job gains of the last decade and then some! 

  Over in the UK, economic activity has started to reaccelerate. This reacceleration should not be mistaken for a new boom in economic growth. I think investors/traders should brace themselves for persistently disappointing data points over the next 1-3 months. If we were at 100 pre-virus which we weren’t), The US and UK economies are going to undergo a transition; from total shut down, i.e., 0, to 1, then 2,3,4,5, and so on till we get to 100. It is quite improbable that we go from 0 to 100 in the second quarter. Trust me, homies, we are going to be on some chill s\*&%.

***Riding into the danger zone:*** **Bankruptcies Rising**

  Investor consensus and policymakers alike keep expecting consumers and businesses bounce back as a function of an  “increase in pent up demand'' that has been cultivated as a result of being locked away for a month. The data so far fails to confirm this. Below is an extract from a Bloomberg;

*“****Some 42% of American non-financial public companies are discussing slashing investments, 27% are talking about \[cutting\] equity payouts and 17% are focused on drawing down on credit lines, conclude economists Andrew Y. Chen and Jie Yang. At the peak of the last recession, the figures were 25%, 11%, and 7%, respectively.”***  

   Businesses are ridding in the danger zone, and bankruptcies are rising.

You see, rising bankruptcies create a vicious circle. As bankruptcies rise, banks become concerned that their loan books will become worthless. This forces banks to reduce lending, thus reducing credit available to businesses; this creates more bankruptcies, delinquencies, and layoffs. These unfortunate events reinforce banks' decision to reduce available credit even more. Credit/ lending collapses, creating a worsening economic outlook. Highly leverages industries, for example, the restaurants (more on this later) are very exposed here. 

**Tightening Lending Standards.**

Earlier last week, the fed released the senior loan officer survey report to highlight a tightening in lending standards. Below is a summary of the report from Darius Dale @ Hedgeye:

* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Large/Medium C&I Firms**: +4,150bps to 41.5% in APR – the highest reading since JAN ’09 and fastest acceleration since APR ’90
* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Small C&I Firms**: +4,110bps to 39.7% in APR – the highest reading since APR ’09 and fastest acceleration since APR ’90
* **Net % Increasing the Cost of Credit Lines** for Large/Medium C&I Firms: +4,200bps to 32.3% in APR – the highest reading since JUL ’09 and fastest acceleration ever
* **Net % Increasing the Cost of Credit Lines for Small C&I Firms**: +2,990bps to 25.4% in APR – the highest reading since OCT ’09 and fastest acceleration ever
* **Net % Increasing Credit Spreads Over Banks’ Cost of Capital for Large/Medium C&I Firms**: +6,170bps to 40.9% in APR – the highest reading since JUL ’09 and fastest acceleration since OCT ’07 
* **Net % Increasing Credit Spreads Over Banks’ Cost of Capital for Small C&I Firms**: +4,050bps to 30.2% in APR – the highest reading since OCT ’09 and fastest acceleration since OCT ’07 
* **Net % Tightening Loan Covenants for Large/Middle** C&I Firms: +4,020bps to 33.3% in APR – the highest reading since JUL ’09 and fastest acceleration since APR ’90
* **Net % Tightening Loan Covenants for Small C&I Firms**: +2,570bps 24.2% in APR – the highest reading since JUL ’09 and fastest acceleration since APR ’09
* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer Credit Card Loans**: +2,490bps to 38.5% in APR – the highest reading since JUL ’09 and most rapid acceleration since JUL ’08
* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer New and Used Auto Loans**: +710bps to 16.0% in APR – highest reading ever
* **Net % Tightening Lending Standards for Consumer Loans ex-Credit Cards and Autos**: +2,020bps to 21.8% in APR – the highest reading since JUL ’09 and fastest acceleration since JUL ’08

**The Knock-on effects.**

The evidence above demonstrates that for businesses;

1 ) The cost of credit is rising at a time where businesses need access to money,2

2) Lending standards are increasing, further reducing access to credit. 

1+2= Rising probability of bankruptcy.

For consumers;

1) High unemployment causes banks to perceive the consumer as a source of lending risk thereby making it difficult to obtain credit

2) Lending standards for auto loans and credit cards are rising, decreasing the availability of credit for the consumption of consumer goods ( cars, phones, etc.). 

1+2= Rising probability of widespread solvency events. 

**Unique opportunities in Carvana**

If lending standards are tightening for auto loans, auto businesses like Carvana are likely likely to underperform. Buying put spreads makes sense. Buying November 2020 $80puts and selling the $70 puts should cost about $3 at the time of writing this with a $10 payoff. One could also sell short; however, patience should be exercised as it is on a bullish trend with a lot of short interest. Your balls could get squeezed shorting this bastard.

**PRAA**

Debt collectors love recessions. As delinquencies increase, they make more money as they get more business opportunities. These guys are ramping up the purchase of lousy loan books at a discount, an incredible tailwind for them going into 2022. Buy on any pullbacks.

 

**Restaurants**

These guys are facing a severe decline in capacity. Parts of texas see 25% capacity, reduced foot traffic into full-service restaurants. However, the quick service restaurants seem to fair a lot better. I think star bucks falls into the category of restaurants who get hit with reduced capacity. Sell when lower highs are established. If needed, I will drop an alert when it gets to a level I think is an excellent place to sell. I'm not good with squiggly lines.

2463,DD,BCRX DD possible Coronavirus Antiviral and HAE drug,20,ghx1pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghx1pw/bcrx_dd_possible_coronavirus_antiviral_and_hae/,27,1589261881.0,"BCRX has been on a big run this last month and is up over 107% at the time of me writing this so I decided to do some research on it and here is what I found. (TLDR at end)

**Overview / Corona Drug**

BioCryst specializes in antivirals and has recently been focusing on a HAE treatment that has been going well. However, they are testing one of their drugs Galidesivir, a coronavirus treatment that is starting to be compared to Remdesivir. Testing started in April in Brazil so we can expect to see data in the next coming weeks and if successful could be a huge catalyst. Galidesivir could be a more convenient and accessible treatment if tests go well because it is an orally administered drug whereas Remdesivir is a IV administered drug. Orally administered drugs are much more convenient because patients do not need to be in the hospital. This would greatly reduce the risk for all parties involved and could also help ease the load on hospitals for the milder cases. They also had a successful anti viral flu drug Peramivir.

**Government Deal**

It was announced that the company received $82 million in federal funding which was said in their earnings call which could be a good sign but also could mean nothing as the government has been throwing money around like it is literal TP.

Transcript below

\*But I think the three things that I talked about before are the three things that we're currently actively working with the government on, the testing of this specific strain of virus with Galidesivir, the second is understanding how to participate in clinical trials, testing it in humans would be very helpful to the advancement of our program and so we're evaluating that. And then the third is, increasing drug supply.\*

**HAE Treatment**

In February it was announced their once a day oral drug berotralstat accepted and filed as a new drug application by the FDA for prevention of HAE attacks. Their next PDUFA date is December 3rd and the market opportunity for this drug is approx > 500 million according to them. I’m not gonna take the time to explain what HAE is but just know it sucks. If you don’t believe me just search up a picture.

**Shorts being covered?**

Typically the short volume is sizable on this company but I have seen people saying shorts are being covered but I don’t want to pay for peep shows at information like that so I can’t confirm it.

**Volume is up**

Volume is up lol take that however you want to.

**Who owns this Stuff?**

Like most of you, I haven’t heard of this stock before last week. I may have seen it here or there but nothing out of the ordinary. So who owns this shit then? Here's a breakdown:

0.95% held by Insiders

90.2% Held by Institutions (Rumors of up to 95%)

Leaving about 9% to retail investors (low of 4%)

Notable holders

Blackrock Inc. 8.68%

Baker Brothers

7.10%

Millennium Management

6.44%

Janus Henderson Group

6.10%

Point 72 Asset Management

6.44%

Vangaurd Group

5.26%

**Why this matters**

What you or I do means jack squat in respect to moving this company meaning this month's run up was most likely due to institutions picking up more shares. It also means it will be harder to pick up if institutions choose to hold, meaning it could drive up the price.

**Financials**

\[10-K\]([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/BCRX/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&sid=8556&guid=14004797&type=1](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/Stock/BCRX/SecFilings?subview=secarticle&sid=8556&guid=14004797&type=1))

Never been profitable since inception but it doesn’t look like they will be going bankrupt anytime soon.(I think? I’m still learning how to read these walls of text so don’t take my word for it)

I couldn’t find a credit agreement but I’m also kinda retarded

**TLDR**: BCRX **COULD** make a big run as their HAE treatment looks promising and if Galidesvir is successful it could go crazy. Institutions are the ones that own this and it looks like they are either picking up more or holding.

I personally picked up calls Friday and plan on holding them for a bit.

This is the non-convertible restricted debt issued by the federal trust funds like social security OASDI, the highway fund, and other trust funds.  These bonds are issued by the bureau of public debt and are sold to other government agencies, as well as state and local governments.  They appear on the daily treasury statement and are counted towards the national debt ceiling limit.

Due to the fact these bonds are without prejudice, there is no obligation for the federal government to redeem them and thus no secondary market to sell them.  However there is one major issue with these non-bonds, the size of the issue is huge representing one third of the overall debt and half of the dent held by the public.  Even more important, is the size of the turnover in this market which IS MORE THAN THE REST OF THE GOVERNMENT FINANCIALLY, over sixty trillion this year alone.  What did this activity represent?  Why does the government issue and redeem over $200 billion in GAS every day?  Is this designed to manipulate the statutory debt limit which now effectively is suspended?  What does this activity represent?  Why is there so little information in the media about the GAS MONEY?  How did the GAS money bankrupt the federal government and drive America into a fiscal death spiral?  Basically, when you pay into social security, the money goes into the Government Account Series market and gets paid to federal pension benefits.  It is the modern version of quartering soldiers.

One-day certificates are issued by the Bureau of Public Debt as part of the Government Account Series.  Now for those of you who know finance well, the implications of a giant secret rolling spot debt market should be well understood.  For everyone else, the one-day certificate market rolls over every day floating at the repo rate, which is incidentally prone to sharp increases in price due to market forces.  This effectively turns whatever government agencies holding one-day certificates into quasi-public hedge funds with a put on the repo market rate.  Again this really becomes relevant with the size of this market rolling over hundreds of billions of dollars per day.

The wisdom of tying the fate of a huge secret bond market to a non-governmental market rate is questionable.  However so is the general strategy of fiscal suicide employed by the secret labor government in America.  What did all this money get spent on?  Veterans benefits and federal employee benefits which are over three million per capita per federal employee.  This of course gives the self evident answer, pension austerity.  Every pension in the public sector; local, state, and federal, needs to be negotiated as a lump sum for much less than the average person per capita of three million.  Instead, government employees need to invest and budget like everyone else, instead of expecting a blank check for the rest of their lives.  Every federal employee getting a one million dollar check would save the government several million in future value of cancelled pensions.  This would reduce the national debt by one third when implemented and save the taxpayers many trillions more in interest over the expected life of the pension beneficiaries who bankrupted America.

Strategic vulnerabilities tied to short term interest rates controlled by foreign governments notwithstanding, this GAS money issue is the single greatest death star trench like vulnerability in the ability of the government to function.  Either they create permanent inflation and devaluation to accommodate fiscal deficits, or a total bond market implosion and debt default occurs.  Your government has lied to you and needs to be held accountable for fiscal treason.  Pension austerity and bank reorganization are the only economic solutions to the current situation.  Pretending the central bank can just create unlimited cheap three month money to finance trade and pension deficits is again like pretending the Vritish were not coming for the Revolutionary War.  The reality is there is a market valuation for all financial assets based on central bank intervention, and then there is an intervention-free valuation which is again best characterized as fiscal treason.

I’m not putting any futures out just speculating with buy/sells on Plus500 app.

With the volatility of it moving upto 2/barrel a day (based on my limited one week of trading knowledge) am I best off just whacking a few hundred barrels on a buy & sell at same value cashing out the sell when drops and the buy when it goes above and take some decent earnings on both and work from there? Feel like this could be sensible enough as that’s where the movements have been although I guess I’d be exposed it fell on its arse / went through the roof but could just try to be careful on that and not cash out the buy/sell until movement starts to appear the other way?

2485,DD,DDOG Fade,21,ghrvqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghrvqh/ddog_fade/,51,1589246341.0,"Hi guys,

You might remember me from the technical endorsement of Cloudflare I gave 2 days before earnings.  Like many of you, I was deep in NET calls, and was shocked to see a 12% drop after earnings that CRUSHED expectations.

Here is my warning about Datadog (DDOG).  Like Cloudflare, it is excellent technology.  Long term, never bet against good tech.   Today, Cloudflare is back up around 6% at the time of this writing, and my 6/19 calls are regaining ground.

There are similarities between DDOG now and NET before its earnings.  DDOG is at ATHs.  It would need to CRUSH expectations to pop.  But Cloudflare also crushed expectations, and dropped.   This isn't a Twilio or Fastly case --those stocks were NOT ALREADY AT ATH when they had their crazy jumps.

I am in on 5/15 50$ puts on DDOG.  Earnings will not beat expectations as much as they need, and will drop.

I've posted about them previously when they were in the $40's, but $Olli is still on a tear heading into their earnings 6/4. Here's why I'm bullish:

* Ollie's Bargain Outlet is a bottom feeding discount retailer (a la Big Lots) that specializes in sourcing products via close outs, bankruptcy and overstocks. and selling at a steep discount. 
* Because Ollie sells food, they never had to close
* They didn't miss previous earnings by much (-3%) and the current climate gives all the reason for this quarter to be a monster
* While they're up 33% over the past month (who isn't) they're still down 26% from last year. 
* Lots of room to ride this thing for the next few weeks and then bounce before earnings

This is for 5/9-5/11. I’m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you.

My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

&#x200B;

Not much good stuff for this weekend. Just watching the DD from Friday seeing how it pans out. We will get right into a couple plays but this one doesn't have many plays.

&#x200B;

**OKTA;**  Okay, Okta is another cloud company. Straight from Wikipedia it;

>...provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into modern applications, and for developers to build identity controls into applications, website web services and devices.

This means that they can make lots of money when everyone is working at home and overhauling their network because of the increased web traffic. This equates into more growth for an already growing company. I'm just gonna copy and paste the important shit [from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gez830/why_okta_is_a_solid_play/) which gives you everything you need to make a decision.

>Financial performance has been truly outstanding in recent years, with revenue growth reaching 54% annually since 2017. Management comments during the company's investor day on April 1 confirmed that the business keeps firing on all cylinders based on recent data, and several research firms increased their price targets for Okta after the conference.  
>  
>Most high-growth companies in the sector are losing money due to aggressive reinvestment needs to support long-term growth. Okta, on the other hand, is already generating positive free cash flows, and management has ambitious targets over the middle term.  
>  
>Okta intends to deliver revenue growth rates in the range of 30% to 35% over the next five years and a free cash flow margin of 20-25% in fiscal 2024. These targets are not easy to achieve, but they are not unrealistic either when considering the company's track record and future opportunities.  
>  
>Total revenue last quarter reached $167.3 million, an increase of 45% year over year. Subscription revenue was $158.5 million, an increase of 46%. Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) reached $1.21 billion, growing by 66% year over year.

Earnings come out 5/28 and should be a beat. I don't plan on entering this myself but I will absolutely look into it again next week and make a firm decision by then. I will update in one of my posts that week what I will do with Okta.

&#x200B;

**CDLX;**  Cardlytics is a company that provides a marketing channel inside apps like Wells Fargo & Bank of America, through consumer cash-back deals. For the retards, they put ads in banking apps with discounts so that people are likely to buy them. As we know, people are spending a shit ton of money online. Amazon, Shopify, Etsy, etc. are all making money hand over fist because of our consumer culture. People are spending money and this is good for any company that advertises deals. Here is what is interesting and the reason I might buy into this, according to the [OP of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gg0jz7/cardlytics_nyse_cdlx_preearnings_call_next_monday/), before covid most of the ads in these banking apps were for airlines, cruises, theme parks; attractions. Now, most of these ads are for clothing deals, carryout, amazon, movies. This means they have successfully flipped their market to generate maximum profit from consumer trends in the wake of a quarantine. If this is true then it is brilliant. Another indicator of performance is the fact that Cardlytics insiders have been buying into their company to the point of spending around $33 million to buy shares of their own company.

If I had the liquidity to buy in, I would. Earnings release after hours today and I can see them reaching above $50 easily. I'm tied up right now but if I would have seen this earlier I would be in. Do your own research though.

&#x200B;

**Guidance;**  If you have SmileDirectClub (SDC) calls then I would sell today, this is if you bought them because of my post on Friday. This run-up is indicative of a massive sell off after earnings no matter if they are good or not. If you got the $8.5 then you are a wealthy man. Don't be greedy. Wish I would have bought it on Friday last week. 

edit; My bad I thought earnings came out after hours today. Disregard this I would still hold.

&#x200B;

**My moves;**  Because of popular demand and as a credibility enhancer, I have decided to include my moves in regards to the stocks that I write about. This will include things from past DD summaries and ongoing trades. Most of them will not be this long and will only include my moves not an explanation but because this is the first I will include that stuff and more.

Today (5/11) I bought CSCO $45.5c 5/15 and LOGI $60c 5/15 because both are down today and report earning very soon. Both were in my last DD summary so read that for more information on why. I plan to use the earnings from both of those plays to get in on BOX and carry over into next week. I also have some SATS calls that I am still trying to offload. I made quite a bit on SATS $35c so I used a small percentage of my profits to buy back in at $40 and lost that money but I’m not hurt over that.

I have a project going on with another user which will help find the perfect options contract to make a reasonable amount of money based on the smallest moves in underlying price. It is in its testing phases right now but we plan to use it next week for ourselves to see how well it works then I will look into releasing some of that information to you guys. That's all I can really say about it but know that it's taking up a bit of my time because of research and implementation.

&#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

**TLDR;** Okta could make big bucks I will update on that one, Cardlytics will get above $50, Sell SmileDirectClub calls today.

**Plays;** OKTA calls for 6/5 (but dont buy yet), CDLX calls above $50 for 5/15 and buy today because they report after hours.

Meet Tencent Music ($TME) – the Chinese twin of Sportify. It now has 644 million users and the number of paying users has increased by 47.8% YoY as of end of 2019. The company has been on a contract making spree with major music labels all over the world and has done very well. These guys have contracts with Sony Music, Warner Music and other major industry players.

* Across the course of calendar 2019, according to MBW’s calculations, TME generated $514m from paying online music subscribers, and $1.03bn in terms of total online music revenues – including streaming plus downloads;

* TME’s paying music users figure in Q4 2019 (39.9m) was up 47.8% year-on-year, and up by 4.5m on the prior quarter (Q3 2019, see chart below). For comparison, Spotify’s subscriber number at the end of the same period (Q4 2019) was 124m, up by 11m on the prior quarter;

* TME’s revenues from online music subscribers ($160m) in Q4 2019 was up 60.1% year-on-year;

* TME’s monthly ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User) in terms of online music stood at 9.3 RMB (approximately $1.33) in Q4 2019 – an 8.1% improvement on the equivalent figure from Q4 2018.

With the lockdown, they have been gaining more paying users so there is a chance it blows the lid off this quarter. Again, this is a retarded play but it is so cheap with the big upside potential that I’d regret not taking the chance. TO VALHALLA! Not drawing any correlations but Spotify is traded at 150 and this baby is only 11.

First time doing my own DD write up, I figured it was my time to contribute to the community here. It is a brief DD but gets the point across.

TLDR; calls 5/15 or 6/19

Less TLDR; Online women's retailer using tech and influencers, online retail up since April, bankrupt brick and mortars present great opportunities, women love to swipe daddy's credit card even in pandemics. Short squeeze of a lifetime happening as we speak. This thing can move liek wayfair. Youtube about analysis incase you are too retarded and can't read: [**https://youtu.be/LUGhAzd2izo**](https://youtu.be/LUGhAzd2izo)

**Overview**

RVLV is an online brand/retailer of women's clothes that all the hot instagram thotties like to wear [https://www.instagram.com/revolve/](https://www.instagram.com/revolve/). They are super popular among Millenial/Gen Z women who are willing to dish out a bit more cash on daddy's credit card for the latest fashions. Social media/infleuncer marketing is the hallmark of how they drive business and it has proven to be successful for them. The company uses its tech algorithms to predict and steer the latest trends so that they are able to keep light inventory and not burn too much cash (light inventory was actually an issue in their last ER). The company IPO'd in June 2019 and is profitable! 52 week high stock price of $48.36, 52 week low of $7.17. Sitting at \~$15 as of this writing.

**Stock During Covid19**

In the late weeks of March, the company released a statement that the pandemic had indeed hurt sales and that they would be withdrawing forward looking year guidance. The stock suffered from that news and has not recovered to its pre covid levels. Stock was around $21 pre covid, dropped down to about $7, now sitting at $15.

However, based on this chart from BoA, online retail numbers are up significantly since April. Retail obviously is a very broad term, but I would like to think includes clothes and thus includes Revolve. The customer base of Revolve also is the wealthier kind who probably aren't suffering from unemployment but are instead bored and online shopping for new clothes.

&#x200B;

[BoA Chart](https://preview.redd.it/kadtxk7ib5y41.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7e6c08491e9d4303d5a5c96bbf47ceac568b560)

**Stock Information**

This stock is massively manipulated. Retail makes up about .3% of all shares, so it is heavily owned by institutions/insiders. 40% of the retail shares are held short. This thing can squeeze the fuck up like Wayfair has and it has already started to on Friday. Up 50% since 9:30am on Friday.

Thing is, a lot of these shorts have yet to cover! So, I predict that they will cover in the coming days as well as after ER. This company is a tech/fashion company and is sooo far off its 52 week high while many other tech companies are hitting all time highs. I expect this thing to run big time.

**Conclusion**

Company is heavily shorted right now and way down from its pre Covid/52 week highs. ER is on Wednesday 5/13 and I expect a big jump afterwards. Company has no debt other than drawing down on $30m line of credit (good for investors in my opinion). Company IS PROFITABLE. J Crew and other brick and mortar retailers are dying and going bankrupt.

2499,DD,$BABA and the Chinese Recovery - What People Might be Missing,35,ghorhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghorhf/baba_and_the_chinese_recovery_what_people_might/,32,1589236766.0,"Alibaba ($BABA) is a Chinese e-commerce company and the largest commerce company in the world on gross merchandise value. 


Along with their core offerings in Taobao (consumer-to-consumer retail) and Tmall.com (third-party retail platform), they also operate the leading cloud platform in China, AliCloud, and have several strategic investments, including Alipay (leading China payment platform).


The company saw a selloff from $230 per share beginning in January as the uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19 weighed negatively on results. Shares bottomed out 22% down at around $180 per share on 3/23. We know this was likely the bottom because this is the day when Softbank sold their stake and they are experts at selling low. 


I think it's generally well-understood that the recovery into March has been substantially better than expected - online sales of physical goods re-accelerated ~11% year over year in March, versus 3% y/y in January and February. This improvement was coming at a time when many consumer discretionary categories were 20-30% down on Taobao, driven by staples such as food, beverages and oil. Many of the sell-side research analysts believe that e-commerce trends will continue to improve into the back half of this year and thus believe share prices will improve past the $230 highs seen pre-COVID. $BABA will very likely beat on FYQ4 (CYQ1) earnings on 5/22. Sell-side expectations of about 20-25% growth into the June quarter may be more like 30% which would be favorable on share price.


What I think is not as well covered / understood is that the near-term price dynamics will also be heavily influenced by the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) meeting occurring on 5/22, same day as $BABA earnings. The NPC is basically the equivalent of the US government deciding on the federal budget. Unlike in the US, where the government shuts down every single time because people can't agree on anything, generally the Chinese government has done whatever it needed to do in order to backstop growth, through a mix of credit expansion, fiscal deficits, infrastructure projects, direct government investments and potential direct stimulus / cash subsidies. 


While the 5/22 earnings will probably be optimistic, the 5/22 meeting will probably be enormously positive. I don't see a world in which the US pursues massive government capital injections and the Chinese government does not. This should both immediately and medium-term hugely benefit Alibaba, which has 60% e-commerce market share in China as the clear leader.

2500,DD,Next up on Retail Bankruptcies: Express Inc.,11,ghob95,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghob95/next_up_on_retail_bankruptcies_express_inc/,19,1589235294.0,"Okay fellow autistic bears of WSB here you go.

Now that we’re starting to reopen brick and mortar across the nation and the first news of second wave is finally starting to emerge across Europe and Asia, I’m finally confident enough to release my research. 

Express Inc. the store you always walked by in the mall that triggered PTSD of a time you were able to get into a slim fit v neck and slug Red Bull vodkas down while listening to DJ Paully D. I think it’s finally time to put the nail in this one. 

Sales:
We’re all smart enough to see the writing on the wall. With 300+ stores closed across the nation, the primary driver of sales for Express has been decimated (similar to all retail chains who’s primary focus are not online). Second wave will be touch and go around states causing uncertainty in projected sales as foot traffic will be uncertain as states continue to figure out their return to normal. With the kind of clothing they sell, most people try before they buy, this could also increase cost of inventory for constantly having to sanitize products in store, or increase inventory costs from constant back and forth from online returns.

Secondly, let’s look at the target market for Express clothes. Their product is mainly focused around businesses and casual wear. Considering there’s a large movement towards WFH, I don’t see many people buying dress shirts, pants etc. On the casual side, bars and restaurants will be the last to open. As less people will be dressing for a night out, I see another major dent in sales. 

Express have turned to online sales to generate revenue. However, they’re a discretionary product. They state in the risks portion of the 10-K they’re facing heavy competition from online retailers and lower priced product (like an H&M). Substitute goods.

Also, net sales have been flat or going down since 2015.

Product:
Express relies 100% on manufacturing from both Asia and South America. This means that they could face major supply interruptions as COVID starts to spread in South America and continues to persist in Asia. To top this, Express’ distribution, manufacturing and shipping are 100% outsourced. You may think well, less overhead, which is a fair point, but to be at the mercy of the supply chain may result in reputation damage and lost sales. 

There’s a fair bit more on their product side exposure if you have a look at the 10-K.

Assets:
As the company leases most store space, it doesn’t have hard assets like brick and mortar to sell off and raise cash.

60% of its total assets are a “Right of Use Asset” which funnily just popped up on the Balance Sheet this year and is a lessees right to use an asset over the life of the asset. Not much in the financials about what it is, but I’m calling BS on that having much value when brick and mortar isn’t attractive and no business are looking to pick up leases. Get ready for that to be impaired into the ground.

Other assets are small cash and clothes ... which lord only knows who’s buying a 60 dollar button down with 30M unemployed. 

Liabilities:
Obviously major liability is leases which ST is about equal to all their ST assets. Sure they’ll manage to negotiate, but again, that costs money. Also long term lease liabilities, which oh funny enough is the same amount as the Right of Use Asset. So they’re balance sheet less that one accounting for leases is 800M half of which is going to ST liabilities.

Stock Price:
Okay I’m getting tired but I think we’re starting to get the point. It’s been going down like your girlfriend for the past 5 years. In one of their recent disclosures they issued preferred shares, which I think means further dilution. 

The CEO in the 8-k filed recently mentioned they’re furloughed employees and trying to reduce expenses, but let’s be real, they were headed to penny stock land or bankruptcy long before COVID. This is just the last nail in the coffin.

Earnings for Q2 are going to be terrible, which surely in the limbo stick analyst world will screw me short term as “it wasn’t as bad as expected” is apparently a new acceptable normal. I’m a believer this one is done long term, even if the second wave isn’t as bad as I predict.

Options noob, but I can’t short. Do your own research, this is NOT investment advice.

·  Dollar General since it launched its IPO 12/31/2009 to today has only missed earnings twice in its ten-year stock market rise. The two earnings report days Dollar General was red but the next few days after continued its upwards trend as it absorbs the minor failures.

o  The two dates it missed its earnings are: 12/01/2016 and 03/14/2019

o  8/30/2019 the day after earnings day Dollar General +/- by $27.88 in a day closing green near its day highs.

·  MACD is trending upwards with signal lines indicating it will cross and it has a positive configuration at roughly 16.69-.18.33.

·  Majority of analysts have a strong buy for short- and long-term forecasts

·  Dollar General announced they will hire 50,000 more employees during the Corona Virus era to keep up with booming demand.

·  Overall total volume of the options contracts is currently 3,284 as of this post. The Puts to call ratio: 1.3:1. However open interest has a call ratio of 1.02:1 signaling early entry position to ride the call train as Dollar General only increases over time and is deemed recession proof.

·  Dollar General has profit margins greater than Walmart and Costco and by operating with fewer employees, overhead and selling brand named products at a cheaper rate in low income communities has helped stabilize the impacts of corona deeming it corona proof.

·  DG entered an Uptrend as Momentum indicator exceeded the 0 level on May 8, 2020. Odds for DG making money is very high.

·  Dollar General is a store that consists of cheaper goods than Walmart and Costco. In times of recessions or depressions, I predict the go to store will be Dollar General due to the majority of Americans being middle class to lower class with the majority of American having not even 2 months savings expenses in their accounts.

·  How Does Dollar General Compare to top competitors? There isn’t even an equity summary score for how much DG is going to rise. Look at the price performance in 52 weeks. 2nd to target and no one else even coming close. PE ratio can be used to evaluate future earnings predictions and market cap. Does not count other factors and the P/E ratio is 2nd to Walmart. Dollar General is an under the radar option/stock play. With a Beta of .53, Market movements doesn’t effect it that much due to the fact this Dollar General is Corona proof.

PCG is about to climb out of bankruptcy with an impending vote coming out soon. The deadline for the victims’ vote on the settlement agreement is this Friday. 

PCG will rise (much like it did in January) due to anticipation for the vote. Given that 98% of victims thus far that have casted votes are in favor of the settlement, we will most likely see a case where PCG will exit bankruptcy by June 30. That’s why big whales have parked themselves in OTM september 20 strike calls. However, the near term momentum that the positive vote will provide will also make sure that we see a rally in PCG’s stock through the end of may. Given that analysts have slapped new price targets despite the possibility that the vote may not be a done deal, you can probably expect higher price targets when the vote actually goes through. 

Timeline: last vote by may 15 and results will come out the week after, so may 29 calls are good for this. September 20 strike also has incredible OI and liquidity so those are most likely going to rocket if PCG picks momentum to 17 during May (much like the runup from early Jan to mid February that was caused by the anticipation of pcg leaving bankruptcy. 

Basically, buy pcg calls for end of may and september

Update 2: Up 3.3% today alone, some of you are surely at that 100% profit mark. If you held, good for you! Your balls are bigger than mine.

&#x200B;

\*\*TLDR:\*\*JD will do well and is quite undervalued relative to its closest competitor, Pinduoduo. Analysts are predicting -0.13 EPS for the quarter. Seeing how well Shopify, Wayfair, Chegg, Spotify, etc have done relative to expectations, JD will likely exceed as well. Unusual volume of calls purchased on May 8th as well, potentially indicating some big money is betting on this as well.

\*\*TLDR of TLDR:\*\*JD good. Buy call.5/22 50c (less IV than 5/15)

\*\*What is JD?\*\*Its a large online retail store primarily based in China. Its accessible through the WeChat app, which is China's largest messaging app and 3rd largest in the world behind Facebook messenger and Whatsapp.

\*\*Why should I care?\*\*JD.com had 321 million annual active customer accounts in June of 2019 and in Q4 it had 362 million. I expect this number to hit 400 million or higher, especially with the spike in online purchasing in China during the covid crisis. For context, the entire population of the USA is 330 million. 90% of its purchases arrive same-day or next-day, outperforming both Pinduoduo and Alibaba in terms of logistics. Its earnings & revenues have grown YoY and it has **exceeded earning expectations for the past 3 quarters.**

&#x200B;

\*\*Comparison to Pinduoduo:\*\*Another large e-commerce company in China is Pinduoduo (PDD). They have the 2nd most active users (\~580 million) of any e-commerce company in China, apart from Alibaba. PDD has almost the same market cap as JD yet their revenues are vastly different. JD had sales revenue of $82 billion in 2019, yet PDD had only $4 billion. On top of this, PDD posted a net income of -1 billion, while JD had +1.75 billion. JD's user base has also been rapidly growing, however this is more relevant if you're thinking of LEAPS or just buying shares. JD also has 3x the net assets of PDD and also appears to have a better customer reputation and retention rate than both PDD and even Alibaba, as JD's delivery times are quick and they also heavily work on eliminating counterfeit items sold by merchants. JD outperforms PDD in essentially every way, apart from user count. Sure, user count is useful but if it doesn't translate into revenue, then what?In summary, **roughly equal market cap, yet JD has a much better balance sheet and growth rate**. PDD has routinely missed expectations, does not have a strong logistics network as it almost entirely uses 3rd parties, and is overly reliant on small merchants that were likely impacted during shutdowns. Please note that the numbers below are in renminbi.

&#x200B;

[JD](https://preview.redd.it/vim0xb2wusx41.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=a345732d69bd265f1c3f8b84d4f0f47897499e1c)

\*\*Comparison to... Amazon?\*\*Before you grill me, no I am not saying JD is equivalent to Amazon or will get there within a few months. I am saying that there are some similarities that poise JD for future growth. Just like Amazon, JD has its own warehouses and they sell directly to consumers. They also allow 3rd party sellers, they have their own logistics and distribution, cloud services, IoT (Volkswagan partnership), and grocery stores. Hell, they even have some dabblings in insurance and healthcare with a stake in Allianz and a subsidiary, JD Health. JD Health was recently in the news for its coronavirus rapid testing and ability to book an appointment on their app. These are more relevant if you want to buy longer-term calls or shares (wtf is a share? Some weird kind of call without worrying delta, theta, and vega fucking me?).

\*\*What about the economic damage due to covid?\*\*China is already showing signs of recovery for consumer confidence and purchasing. Furthermore, JD has livestreaming services. Livestreaming revenues in China are up [470%](https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3083562/e-commerce-live-streaming-help-drive-recovery-chinas-retail-scene). Online sales are up 36%. Thus, for at least for Q1, I'm confident in JD's performance. If you're playing for earnings, then the longer term macro environment isn't as important. Yes, JD could address the global economic uncertainty and pull an Amazon type move during earnings, though I personally doubt that they would do so. This would only display weakness and perhaps allow their competitors PDD and BABA to use this against them. See Chinese recovery graphs below.

![img](xw66vh6pvsx41 ""App downloads during China's covid crisis - JD has grocery stores as well
"")

\*\*What about Trump threatening tariffs again? What if this a Luckin Coffee situation?\*\*Unlikely to matter, JD's business is entirely within China and not dependent on trade. They're focused on the consumer demand and logistics side of things. They also work with domestic firms via their 3rd party sales. Even foreign companies such as [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/09/jdcom-walmart-invest-500-million-in-chinese-company-dada-jd-daojia.html) rely on JD due to their influence within China. They also own a 12% stake of JD. Do you think Walmart would risk their money if this was anything like LK? JD also has [partnerships](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/24/jdcom-makes-big-partnerships-4-us-tech-companies.aspx) with Microsoft, Western Digital, Volkswagen, and HP. All of these partnerships are for domestic sales. JD is not importing or exporting anything in significant quantities.

If you look at 7/17, there was a volume of \~17500 for the 55c traded on May 8th. This is **50x the volume for this contract** (normal daily volume \~350). Furthermore, there was a single order of 7500 placed at the end of the trading day for this specific contract. This is equivalent to 2.7 million USD. Looking at other strikes and expiration dates, this order is still unusually large.

There were two other large orders from the same exchange placed within seconds of the first trade, listed below. Most trading days for the 6/19 41c contract have a volume of less than 100. Friday, May 8th had 14000, with these two near-simultaneous trades comprising half of this. Combined cost of these 3 orders is 7.6 million USD.

Were there any other comparable days to Friday's option trading? Yes, there was one. The second largest day for the 6/19 41c was on 03/31 with a volume of 10000. **The following two weeks after this large trade, the stock went up 18% from $40 to $47.3**. There were also large volumes for various 6/19 strikes +/- 3 days of 03/31 prior to JD's first run-up in April. This could be pure coincidence but its interesting to note.

Even disregarding these 3 large orders, Friday May 8th had record volume for most strikes across several expiration dates. Of course there's no way for me to know who placed these trades or why they were placed. Insider trading? Large hedge? Long call ladder? A fellow WSBer trying to post some epic gains porn?

For earnings:

5/22 50c

I'm personally not doing the 5/15 options simply due to their higher IV. This also gives some buffer in case there's any overall market drop this week that affects JD.If you are going to wait until the last minute to buy these, please be aware that JD has their earnings report before market open. In other words, buy before EOD 5/14.

For longer-term calls:

Wix is a company that allows you to easily make websites (think of something like Shopify but less enterprise/e-commerce focused and more targeted towards SMBs that simply want online presence). With the advent of the coronavirus has come much pain to small businesses and the like. What do they do to survive? Make websites.

Now, WIX recently hit an all-time high this week. It recently indicated that Q1 results will meet previous guidance (which means there is a high chance it exceeds guidance). Analysts and the stock market websites you shouldn't listen to (but that you can use to your advantage) almost universally expect WIX to beat expectations. Fundamentally, WIX is very good. It has a strong niche, strong revenue growth, much-better-than-competitors margins, and is valued at significant discount to some of its peers that have run up recently. WIX also easily meets the ""famed"" Rule of 40. For small and medium businesses that want an online presence right now, it has Shopify beat for cost and flexibility (especially non e-commerce businesses).

So WIX is well poised to take advantage of the paradigm shift to online (because of our dear friend 'Rona). See Google Trends.

https://preview.redd.it/oiqe4pqqw4y41.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e351e985c0a6a9deddfbbdfba2128bc940b8025

But regardless of fundamentals, the play I am advocating for is quite simple: take advantage of the fact that the big boys know most of what I have said already, and also that WIX is relatively less followed, and play the run up to earnings. Another factor that will work in your favor is that when the price of WIX moves, its option prices *really* move (I believe 3x on Friday, close to 10x since Wed). I'm playing the 5/15 $170c.

TLDR: Play the WIX run-up to earnings and the fact people expect it to beat; buy the 5/15 $170c (or 6/19 if you're not totally crazy) and sell before earnings.

If you want I can do more fundamental-type analysis for WIX and analyze whether holding through earnings makes sense.

Edit: Almost forgot about this post, but it seems like a couple ppl are curious know what happened. Here’s how it went down: I first loaded up on the 5/15 170c at $2.00, then averaged up at $4.00. Sticking to my strategy (and since they had run up to abt $8ish the day before earnings), I sold a large portion right before earnings. My thesis fundamental wise was validated with their results and market reaction the following day and I exited my remaining position above $15. After some more research, I got back in on the brief dip  with the $180c, which I rolled this morning to the $190 call (sold before eod). I think WIX could run more (or not) but I’d rather find the next play. Really do wish just one of you guys would have asked for my fundamental analysis and earnings thesis cause if even one person had asked I would have done it. To each their own I suppose.

2510,Discussion,Historical Buy@Close/Sell@Open vs Buy@Open/Sell@Close Returns,122,ghlj9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghlj9r/historical_buyclosesellopen_vs_buyopensellclose/,29,1589224034.0,"A couple posts this week have discussed whether or not futures were being used to artificially inflate market prices. I have also been interested in how sentiment shifts outside market hours have affected SPY returns and if we could back out sentiment shifts from market data.

To examine this question, I simulated returns from 2 portfolios which invest in SPY:

* BACR:  (Buy-at-close-returns) - Buy SPY at close, sell at open next day; The ""overnight"" portfolio.
* BAOR:  (Buy-at-open-returns) - Buy SPY at open, sell at close same day; The ""daily"" portfolio.
* dif: (short for difference) - the spread between the portfolios (BACR - BAOR)

I computed returns for these portfolios over 5 time horizons:

* 10 years
* 1 year
* 4 months
* 7 weeks (I.e. since market bottom 3/23/20)
* 1 month

The theory is that when overnight sentiment shifts are mainly negative (i.e. news is mostly bad), the BAOR portfolio will outperform (and thus the spread will be more negative). Likewise, when overnight sentiment shifts are mainly positive, we expect the  BACR portfolio to outperform (and thus the spread will be more positive). When overnight sentiment shifts little, the portfolios should be about even (and the spread should be around 0).

In other words, dif (the BACR-BAOR spread) is an instrumental variable which measures overnight sentiment shocks.

If we accept this analysis, then we make the following observations:

1. In March 2020, we saw unprecedented negative overnight sentiment shocks (the BACR - BAOR spread decreased by the largest amount on record). Shockingly, the BAOR actually \*increased\* in March. In other words, **if you bought into SPY before the crash but only held during the day, you would be profitable.**
2. This pattern seems to have reversed lately. Looking at the 4 week chart, the BAOR portfolio has lost money! That is to say, **all the gains in the last month have come overnight**! Depending on your view, you could say that this is due to positive sentiment changes after hours (i.e. good news), and/or market manipulation on low volume.
3. Looking at the 16 week chart, we see that negative sentiment peaked on/around 4/1, after which sentiment shocks started to become more positive, bringing the spread (dif) back towards 0.
4. **The negative peak in the spread (on 4/1/20) was the ideal point to change over from the daily  portfolio (BAOR) to the overnight (BACR) portfolio.** This is most clear on the 16 week chart. Of course, you would have had no way of knowing that it wouldn't go lower... However, this is still interesting as it marked a change in the nature of the rally from mostly daily gains, to mostly overnight gains. 

What else (if anything) do you guys get from this? What other questions do you have? What other analysis could I try with this data?

We all know that stonk can fuck us in 3 ways: ~~pussy, anal, and oral~~. Up, Down, and Sideway. This rings my ball (a ~~small~~ nano one). Isn't this all just Quantum Physics?

Now, for those who watched Ant-Man, all knows quantum physics in depth already. But, lets still review some basics.

*\[Physics\]* When observing things, you are observing a reflection of electromagnetic wave bouncing off objects. So, basically, you cannot see something without touching one, and when you touch one, you change it. This phenomenon indeed has a name: **The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.**

*\[Stock\]* How does this apply to stock? The price of each stock and contract are floating between bid and ask spread. In order to know the true price of a stock, you must place your bid/ask, but this is essentially changing its price. I would like to call it: **The Autistic Gambling Principle.**

\----

*\[Physics\]* So what is in a particle? We don't know! When you look closely, a particle is just a blurry sphere of influences that we know existed.

*\[Stock\]* When you look into a stock, you would think it is constructed with some solid hard 10-K sheet, financial statements, and fundamentals. But, this is where you are wrong! A stock is just like particles. it is a sphere of influences that we only know existed but don't know what of.

\----

*\[Physics\]* When scientist try to predict a particle with using Quarks, Leptons, and Bosons, they failed bad. Because they did not anticipate the stage itself, the gravity!

*\[Stock\]* This is why many of the epic DD we see here failed so hard. They did not accounted for the almighty United State of America Federal Reserve System. (For those retarded fuck, this is the full name of ""Fed"" that you see in the shitpost here).

\----

# Abstract:

DON'T PANIC HERE! Be hold my autistic friends! The chosen one has already shared the ultimate solution for this fucked up situation. **The theory of everything - The String Theory.**

String Theory is able to describe many particles as different modes of vibration of a string. Most importantly, this includes gravity.

*\[Stock\]* In the name of Stonk God, here, I announce the era of **The Quantum Trading Theory**.

# Chapter 1: Stonk Only Go Up

Let me get this straight. Don't trust the title. stock DOES NOT go up. In fact, it wants to go flat or sideways. Why? Because, stock price is partially observed by crowd with using broker platform under masks (the bid/ask spread). And, its actual price is determined with trader spooking it constantly. When it is relaxed in a zero volume moment, the price will continue to be flat until someone try to unveil its true price.

This true nature helps the formation of the infamous **Theta Gang**. During a peaceful day, theta gang's win ratio is great because of the behavior described above. When trading volume don’t change much, it is the best to practice Theta Gang. While you can, you should also monitor volume constantly, in observation of the quickest tank that happened 2/19/2020. The volume dramatically doubled in two day, when this happens, dump all your shit and run. It is okay to take some loss. You will recover form the next move.

# Chapter 2: F, The Fed Coefficient

This is where you go to college class in the second week and got blown away by how professor jumped the topic from *V = IR*   to   *I\_c = I\_s \* (e\^(V\_be/V\_t) - 1) \* (1 + V\_ce / V\_a)*.

I will emphasis again stock price is determined by trader taking action (volume).

[Quantum Trading - The Golden Equation](https://preview.redd.it/lrq8tqb8c5y41.png?width=111&format=png&auto=webp&s=f63503f0dbd04076828db0ec1b1e01a7d45e085e)

In this equation, the price movement is a summation of Fed's desire minus movement of volume.

What does Fed want? They want USA rally to moon. The is the beauty of The Theory of Quantum Trading. I have just invented **The Fed Coefficient, F**. We default this to be a positive coefficient.

# Chapter 3: Volume Effect (The Gay Bear Effect)

Continuing on the quantum trading - **The Golden Equation** from chapter 2. When trader takes action, they are simply guessing. The trend of guessing establishes the price movement. In another explanation, the change of price is negatively correlated to the change of volume.

By logic, there is always a gay bear speaking the loudest on top of the world. This is very much like the existence of cockroach. They are just there. No one knows why they are so resilient.

Back to quantum trading. Most trader are embedded with gay bear soul. This is just as much as a ""Born evil or Born good"" question. I have a yet to be proved hypothesis: **Trader Are Born Gay**.

Under the creation of Stonk God, every time we enter our bid/ask. We always try to enter a tiny bit lower to ensure a fill. This nature of gay bear behavior established the relationship between stock price and volume. The more trade is entered, the more accumulation of this slight lower bid/ask price is entered. **Therefore, stock price go down with increase of volume**. **Vise versa, stock price go up with decrease of volume.**

# Conclusion:

When there is a equilibrium between The Fed Coefficient and the volume, trader should position their strategy with using **Theta Gang**.

When there is a decline of volume, just like this past 2 weeks. **The Fed Coefficient** is dominating the price movement. Therefore, trader should NOT fight with Fed. Get as much CALLS as you can.

In the event of crisis, volume will increase. But, this never occurs overnight. Not even on the zoomer's memorial day, 2/19/2020. All trader should be aware when such trend starts and act quickly. The strategy under **Volume Effect (The Gay Bear Effect)** is to get as much PUTS as you can.

Here, we have concluded and covered the necessary actions and plays under all three scenarios that traders are historically being fucked. Namely, ~~pussy, anal, and oral~~. Up, Down, and Sideway.

2520,Discussion,"Hey WSB, WTF is logistics?",68,ghh7qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghh7qk/hey_wsb_wtf_is_logistics/,35,1589202161.0,"Good evening autists,

I've decided to make this post in order to give you all insight of what I see as a underexamined area of weakness (especially in this sub) and I believe is a possible harbinger of what lies ahead, which is the logistics industry. There are many moving parts and niches in the industry and most businesses rely on logistics services to support their operations (from the supply of raw materials, moving product from manufacturer to distribution center, clearing freight through customs, storage, or delivering final products to stores or customer's door). There are steamship lines (SSLs), airlines (ALs), freight forwarders, customs brokers, truckers, distribution centers, warehouses and they all participate to assist companies who import their products to different markets get them there as fast as possible (unless you're an SSL) at the lowest cost. 

These services have allowed products to be made more cheaply internationally due to low labor/material costs, mainly, which in turn allows markets to buy them cheaper. For the US, this is critical because it doesn't really manufacture much anymore as it's moved on from a manufacturing economy to a more service based economy over a handful of decades (trade deficit for March increased to $44.4 billion difference in imports over exports  [https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html) ).

[We're on a downtrend due to trade war, which is good, but $44 bil on 3month avg is basically impossible to make up for in any kind of short-term basis.](https://preview.redd.it/f99u5orvnux41.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=82af082de1b528ddaf21556aa80d9a1e920a7980)

With this change from a manufacturing economy to a more service based economy, basic logistics services have seen steady growth for multiple decades. In general, when an industry is in its infancy, you have many small players (usually) and over time they consolidate. Well, this is similar to what's happened in the SSL sector of the logistics industry and this is where I'll start.

**SSLs** 

You can do your own research, or just take my word for it, but SSL alliances have picked up  starting the last decade or more ('08 recession put upward pressure on this) as record losses were prominent for almost all carriers due to over-supply and reducing demand. This fact then pushed them into rate wars (SSLs undercutting freight rates to push out competition). Rate wars then forced alliances among the SSLs. Larger players forming pacts with similar larger players in order to wipe out the smaller players, which in turn has forced the smaller players to build pacts in order to fight back. If you're wondering how this isn't an antitrust issue, it has been brought up and investigated by the DOJ though I'm not going full on into the weeds on that but basically, ""Antitrust investigators believe that due to a history of legally having the ability to discuss pricing under antitrust immunity, the industry lacks a disciplined culture and is therefore susceptible to illegal activity. For example, the DOJ regularly issues a statement raising concerns after the FMC allows a shipping alliance or major vessel-sharing agreement (VSA) to take effect"" \* [https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/container-lines/us-antitrust-probe-container-shipping-ends\_20190226.html](https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/container-lines/us-antitrust-probe-container-shipping-ends_20190226.html) (think OPEC-ish). With the formation of these pacts came investment in new containerships at a record pace. It was a race to see who could buy the largest ship in order to save cost through economies of scale and crush the competition on the highest traffic lanes globally (i.e. major import lanes like Shanghai to Los Angeles or Shanghai to Rotterdam). The first major player to fall was Korean SSL Hanjin just over 4 years ago. At the moment, we only have 3 alliances that control\~80% of the capacity of ocean cargo transported globally. The breakdown of alliances is below ([https://www.morethanshipping.com/the-impact-of-the-container-shipping-alliances/](https://www.morethanshipping.com/the-impact-of-the-container-shipping-alliances/) ).

[Pick your poison](https://preview.redd.it/am4yjxez5vx41.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e44651fa904fb9387bee8970113dbd80ef24896)

However, unfettered competition remains within these main trades regardless of the alliances made. It is tantamount to a war of attrition and that is going to be devastating in the current environment. See below recent reports on SSLs.

An April 8th article in WSJ ( [https://www.wsj.com/articles/container-ship-operators-idle-ships-in-droves-on-falling-trade-demand-11586359002](https://www.wsj.com/articles/container-ship-operators-idle-ships-in-droves-on-falling-trade-demand-11586359002) ) stated the below points

*  Container ship operators have idled a record 13% (OP Note: this easily beats the '08 recession) of their capacity over the past month as carriers at the foundation of global supply chains buckle down while restrictions under the coronavirus pandemic batter trade demand. 
*  Alphaliner, based in Paris, said more than 250 scheduled sailings will be canceled in the second quarter alone, with up to a third of capacity taken out in some trade routes. The biggest cutbacks so far have hit the world’s main trade lanes, the Asia-Europe and trans-Pacific routes.
*  Ship brokers say giant ships that move more than 20,000 containers each now are less than half full. 
* Sailing cancellations grew from 45 to 212 over the past week, according to Copenhagen-based consulting firm Sea-Intelligence. The “blanked” sailings are stretching into June, indicating operators expect the traditional peak shipping season, when retailers restock goods ahead of an expected buildup in consumer spending in the fall, will be muted this year by the lockdowns extending across economies world-wide.
*  France’s CMA CGM SA, the world’s fourth-largest container line by capacity, said this week it is idling 15 ships because retailers are pulling back orders over falling demand from European and American consumers. 
*  The decision to idle, or “lay up,” ships is a difficult option for owners, as the vessels continue to generate costs without offsetting income.  There are two ways to idle ships. In a “warm layup” vessels are anchored and staffed, ready to go relatively quickly when demand resumes. This means saving on operating costs such as fuel but continuing to pay crew salaries and insurance fees and make charter payments.  In a “cold layup” a skeleton crew is kept on board for general maintenance but most of the ship’s systems are shut down. Returning the ship to service can cost millions of dollars and requires extensive testing to certify that the ship is safe to sail. 

A May 4th article in WSJ ( [https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-shipping-lines-may-not-survive-downturn-hapag-lloyd-chief-says-11588612964](https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-shipping-lines-may-not-survive-downturn-hapag-lloyd-chief-says-11588612964) )  stated the below points.

*  Some container shipping companies may collapse if the global trade downturn stemming from coronavirus lockdowns extends to the end of the year or beyond.
*  The shipping lines that handle the biggest share of the world’s international trade in retail and manufactured goods have canceled up to a quarter of their sailings since late February amid extensive lockdowns and collapsing demand in the U.S. and Europe.
*  The world’s top 10 liner companies, which collectively handle more than three-quarters of the world’s oceangoing container trade, are looking at steep losses from the falling business.
*  Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd, the world’s fifth-largest container line by capacity, according to industry data group Alphaliner, has canceled about 15% of its scheduled sailings on major ocean trade routes, including Asia-Europe and trans-Pacific operations.
*  Some carriers are trying to preserve cash by taking longer trips around Africa instead of crossing the Suez Canal, saving on canal toll costs that can reach around $500,000 for a single big ship. With fuel prices sliding under the crash in oil prices, the cost of the longer sailing makes sense. (OP Note: This increases lead times for buyers and further disrupts company's supply chains)
*  Hapag-Lloyd has thousands of land-based employees working from home and has frozen management salaries and returned leased ships to charterers. It is not looking at layoffs for now. But the carrier is pushing back an order of six megaships that move more than 20,000 containers each, to add to the six it already operates. Those megaships are the big losers with volumes crashing since many are sailing half full, giving up the benefits operators gain from the ships’ economies of scale. 

Knowing the above, see a Feb 28th report ( [https://splash247.com/liner-bankruptcy-potential-at-highest-levels-recorded/](https://splash247.com/liner-bankruptcy-potential-at-highest-levels-recorded/) ) stating the below points.

* The collective Altman Z score of the 14 container shipping companies that publish their financials deteriorated markedly in the 12 months ending September 30, 2019, falling to 1.16 from 1.35 in all of 2018 and thereby signifying a rising probability of bankruptcy.
* ""IMO 2020 was already going to make this a year of huge disruption for the entire maritime industry,"" said Marc Lampieri, a managing director in the transportation and infrastructure practice at AlixPartners. ""Throw in the coronavirus, the recent deterioration of some key financial measures and whatever other unforeseen disruptions lie ahead, and it's clear that preparing for the worst may be the best way to avoid the worst.""

If you're unfamiliar with the Z score formula it is a calculation that predicts the probability that a firm will go into bankruptcy within two years. Anything below a score of 1.8 is considered  a ""very high"" risk of bankruptcy.

So, if this industry sector was reduced to a 1.16 Z score for the 12 months ending Sept 2019 (5   
SSLs produced a scores of less than 1 and all were under the 1.8 level), it's probably a safe bet this score has not gone up since. If more SSLs were to go bankrupt, this would further constrain capacity to even fewer SSLs who are already trying to minimize port calls and slow down how fast ships cycle through their scheduled port calls (their ""string""), causing backlogs that in turn send freight rates higher. Part of the reason they do this is because of the headhaul vs. backhaul issue that occurs on many vessel strings (i.e. lots of freight moving from a ship's origin to particular destinations, but not from the destinations back to the ships origin or future port calls) causing them to issue ""blank sailings"" for some ports, which is their notice that the port will be skipped by a particular vessel. This causes many problems with equipment (container) availability and can further distort freight rates and cause backlogs. If they can only make money going one way, they're losing money more often than not. Furthermore, inactive containership capacity through 2020 is projected to move even higher, increasing the recent record statistic for the sector. Below articles for support.

April 8th article ([https://shippingwatch.com/carriers/Container/article12067889.ece](https://shippingwatch.com/carriers/Container/article12067889.ece)) stating the below points.

*  The large scale sailing cancellations could push the inactive container ship fleet to over 3 Mteu in the coming weeks in the worst capacity crisis that the container shipping industry has ever seen.
*  Several routes with usually large capacity will be fully canceled in the second quarter, including 2M's major AE-2/Swan service, where 12 ships of 23,000 teu sail between Asia and North Europe. ""No market segment will be spared, with capacity cuts announced across almost all key routes,"" writes the firm. 

An article dated May 1st ( [https://theloadstar.com/europe-asia-ocean-rates-hit-new-heights-as-exporters-fight-for-what-space-remains/](https://theloadstar.com/europe-asia-ocean-rates-hit-new-heights-as-exporters-fight-for-what-space-remains/)) via the Loadstar provides an example of how capacity and rates can fluctuate and go haywire relatively quickly. Summary below.

* Normally freight from Asia to Northern Europe is the headhaul (large volume) and the backhaul is NE to Asia (lower volume). However, due to lockdowns happening at different times in Asia vs Europe, this volume has fluctuated highly. Freight rates for NE to Asia in Jan were $500 for a 40' GP (40 ft. general purpose container), as China was in lockdown and demand was poor and space was plentiful. However, now that Europe is in lockdown and Asia is up and running, demand has spiked on the NE to Asia backhaul (as China lifted out of lockdown) and space is basically non-existent and has forced the rate for a 40' GP from a low of $500 in January to $2000 now in May. This is due to the fact that SSLs reverted to blank sailings for NE ports as demand in Europe dropped due to beervirus and caused freight rates to fall from Asia origins. They've been able to steady the rates at Asia origins at the cost of backlogs and rate spikes at backhaul ports.

For SSLs, the game is complicated and tricky while margins are razor thin and the coronavirus exacerbates this. They're trying to manage rates, whether or not to park vessels and how they should do that, which ports do they skip to save money, and how to keep cash flow (as most of them are very much in debt). Their actions then affect shippers and buyers worldwide and it becomes very difficult to manage costs through out global supply chains. When things are this uncertain, for all parties in logistics, sometimes it's like trying to catch a falling knife when moving cargo. If shippers/buyers time it right they can avoid extra costs but if they are trying to ship at the wrong time they're going to feel the pain in the form of high freight rates, delays (which increase storage/demurrage costs), and chargebacks from shipper's/buyer's customer who receive cargo late (depending on terms and conditions of their contracts).

**SSL TL;DR** - Steamship lines have been broken for a while but beervirus has potential to be the catalyst to push many over the edge into insolvency.  In order to stabilize freight rates, SSLs have been parking container ships at a record pace with capacity projected to shrink by more than 3 million TEU (20' container equivalent), which has never happened before. The more SSLs revert to parking vessels in order to stabilize freight rates, the closer it pushes them to bankruptcy (a double edge sword, if you will) and in turn the more companies will pay to move freight in the future. Even if no SSLs go bankrupt, companies will be paying more to move freight regardless due to virus disruption.

&#x200B;

**ALs** 

There has been much already addressed and available about the ALs and I'm just going to assume you're more aware of their history as compared to the SSLs, so I'll make this section short and only provide the details most of you might not get if you're not really involved with logistics.

An article published on May 4th ([https://www.stattimes.com/news/global-air-cargo-capacity-down-by-29-seabury-reports/](https://www.stattimes.com/news/global-air-cargo-capacity-down-by-29-seabury-reports/) ) stated the below points (w/ visuals).

[You already knew this but ALs getting hammered due to passenger decline related to beervirus. That in turn has affected the flow and capacity of airfreight](https://preview.redd.it/tgsdn8iv8wx41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cdcab91dab8360dd06677254d631cfc14fb4e35)

[Passenger aircraft belly capacity reached an all time low at the beginning of April. It has rebounded slightly, but forecasts shows capacity will not be returning to normal in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/szx2tdeo9wx41.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4bbb75fe907b9a5306cb5aec00a85fd22b1db5f)

* Global air cargo capacity is -29% on a YOY basis. (OP Note: A 23% increase in capacity was seen the week of April 22nd-28th for passenger belly aircraft, which is heartening, but considering capacity dropped well over 80%, this recent gain would only constitute \~ 4.5% return to previously normal capacity seen at the beginning of February)
* US- Europe lanes have have had the largest impact so far, but disturbances have been felt on every lane globally and the Europe/Africa, Europe/South America routes are still seeing capacity constraints between 60% and 88%.

So, matching the economic data we've seen recently, airline capacity data is abysmal.

Another article release today by the NY Times also states the dire circumstances ALs face currently ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/business/airlines-coronavirus-bleak-future.html?auth=link-dismiss-google1tap](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/business/airlines-coronavirus-bleak-future.html?auth=link-dismiss-google1tap)).  This article isn't particularly logistics focused, but it provides insight into the passenger side of ALs, which is where they make a majority of their revenue. I've added important points below.

* Passenger traffic is down about 94% and half the industry's  6,215 planes are parked at major airports and desert airstrips.
*  To get through the next few months, airlines successfully lobbied for a huge federal rescue. But half of that money was intended to cover payroll and that will run out by the end of September. 
*  Desperate to preserve cash, the airlines have also aggressively discouraged customers from seeking refunds, offering vouchers for future travel instead...(and) the industry trade group Airlines for America, said that refunding all tickets could lead to bankruptcy.
*  Payrolls have largely been spared the ax, for now, because Congress set aside $25 billion to pay workers through September as long as airlines refrain from imposing furloughs or pay cuts. But some airlines have already tested those limits, and executives have signaled that layoffs will come when those protections expire. 
*  Most industry analysts and executives expect years to pass before airlines fly as many passengers as they did before the pandemic. Even then, a rebound may come in fits and starts, propelled by medical advancements, an economic rebound and shifts in the public’s tolerance for risk. 
*  Take China, for example. The number of domestic flights there started to recover in mid-February, but plateaued in early March at just over 40 percent of levels before the outbreak, according to the International Air Transport Association, a global industry group. (OP Note: The gain back to 40% could be attributed to the large backlog left from China lockdown and Lunar New Year holiday at the beginning of Feb)
*  The airlines are triaging. Even as they slim down to preserve cash, they are finding ways to make what little money they can. Many have put otherwise unneeded planes to use transporting cargo, including medical supplies, taking advantage of a spike in freight prices. 

&#x200B;

**ALs TL;DR** \-  With beervirus, passenger belly space has shrunk to unprecedented levels, causing air freight rates to increase by 5 or 6 times their normal costs on many lanes as planes are parked. Companies are forced to pay through the nose for air freight when cargo critical to their operations is needed due to SSL capacity constraints and the extended lead times across all modes of transportation. Companies trying to utilize air cargo will be paying higher costs indefinitely as air capacity doesn't look to return to normal within 2020.

&#x200B;

Last, I'd like to move on to look at US inventories and US consumer spending as they are the major catalyst when it comes to freight demand. Using US census data, summarized in the below table (this is preliminary data, so not reflecting recent update today but breakdown takes this into account) , [tradingeconomics.com](https://tradingeconomics.com) ( [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/wholesale-inventories](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/wholesale-inventories) ) provides this breakdown of Us inventories:  ""Wholesale inventories in the US fell 0.8 percent month-over-month in March of 2020, less than an initial estimate of a 1 percent drop. Still, it is the biggest decline in inventories since September of 2011. Stocks of nondurable goods slumped 2.7 percent (vs –2.6 percent in the preliminary estimate), while durable goods inventories edged up 0.5 percent (vs 0.1 percent in the preliminary release). Year-on-year, wholesale inventories were down 1.7 percent in March.""

Typically, high inventory points  to economic slowdown, while a low reading points to stronger growth. However, this generality is not true in the current environment. We're seeing inventories lower due to supply shocks presented by the beervirus but at the same time we're seeing major demand shocks so we have this peculiar instance where inventories have fallen the most in over a decade, but still did not fall as much as expected. 

Now look at consumer spending ( [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending) ).

I argue that this shows supply is catching up to demand, as we can see that consumer spending has fallen off a cliff and is projected to fall further.

So, you might be wondering, what does all of this means and what am I getting at?

Within logistics there is a phenomenon that occurs when supply and demand are not managed and become dislocated. This is called the Bullwhip Effect. With the turmoil associated around major players in the logistics industry (SSLs & ALs) and general uncertainty in regards to the the economic outlook, we can expect increased costs associated with inventory, if companies have too much inventory (which is looking like the lesser of two evils IMO depending on the situation), or increased cost in freight spend, if companies don't have enough inventory (which, considering the wild swings in rates, could be devastating in cost). Either way, the point is cost. Costs are going to go up to move all the consumer goods we have been accustomed to buying so cheapy over the last decades of the expansion of the global market place that was supported by the expansion of capacity in global SSLs and ALs. That is why I'm not buying the deflation narrative that is being passed around currently and supported by the FED. Logistics services have been widely overlooked as a major contributor to the deflation in CPI we've seen over the last decade or so, as this coincides with the  alliances created in SSLs and rate wars that ensued. We will see consumer prices increase and inflation will return whether the economy rebound quickly or not. I am short gold, silver, and select precious metal equities, long on global risk assets until this mess can be sorted out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR -**  Logistics services have expanded with globalization and have become key players in keeping companies operating smoothly. SSLs have been creating alliances over the last decade, which caused rate wars (lowering freight costs). Due to beervirus, SSLs and ALs are severely hampered and are parking assets at a record pace, severely reducing capacity that is extremely difficult to expand in any kind of short-term basis. The disruption to supply chains will cause bullwhip effects across supply chains worldwide. This will raise prices for most goods with certainty.

Essentially, this is another tech company that specializes in audio/video.

Bear case - 

They did have minor supply chain related disruptions in Mexico, however, analysts project Q1 earnings to be optimistic for this company. Gloomy long-term economic outlook.

It falls upon earnings release because of guidance, despite having a significant run-up (like HEAR). This still means you can make money before official earnings.

Bull case - 

Good earnings report (which is almost a guarantee) 

Demand for technologies in this sector have been up as a result of remote work and learning for the global populace. Everyone and their grandma is using webcams and microphones because of the quarantine. 

The company cut the recent dividend and has $250M cash liquid: AKA no interim liquidity issues. Personally, the price might fluctuate throughout the week, but we should easily exceed a target threshold price of $16 by earnings given volatility. Despite the increase in volume from 300 to 3300 on the 6/19 $15c, it still isn't late to get in on this position.

Strong earnings reports, especially from tech companies, drove the markets upwards last week, despite unemployment hitting 14.7%, as the economy shed 20.5M jobs. For context, unemployment reached as high as 25% during the Great Depression. Given the current state of joblessness, why are markets so bullish? Here are the details:

1. **Nearly 30 states have begun to reopen, with another five states with plans to reopen soon.** Investors were bullish about the market as the vast majority of states began to reopen facilities ranging from beaches to retail. As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.
2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.
3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.
4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and >1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.
5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.** South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths. Furthermore, research is beginning to indicate that even mildly affected COVID-19 cases produce antibodies, suggesting potential for at least partial immunity even from those who had low to no symptoms. 

**Overall, I remain optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.** While unemployment is incredibly high, government stimulus have enabled most U.S. citizens to sustain in this difficult situation. The reopening of state economies will hopefully provide the stimulus needed for businesses to start re-hiring those who were laid off, leading to a dramatic decrease in unemployment. The May and June jobs reports will be a strong indicator for our recovery.",2020-05-13 04:39:16,0.9972,0.0,-0.2808,0.23879999999999998

If you're like me, you got railed in the ass by betting on tankers last week. It was baffling, as they crushed earning and locked in beautiful rates for the next 2 quarters but seemed to continue slipping. 

But it seems like the perfect storm is brewing RIGHT NOW for our babies to TANK through next week for huge gainz.

Tankers seem to move inverse to oil, and with LA extending it's lockdown to AUGUST (surely many other cities will follow) and renewing tensions with China, oil looks primed for a drawback.
 
Additionally, we're approaching that time of month where oil futures holders start to panic and look to sell off their contracts (tankers have consistently begun uptrends around the middle of each month).

If all that isn't enough, most of these guys are trading at ridiculous discounts, near all time lows regardless of the literal all time greatest market they are enjoying right now.

Interestingly, Borderlands 2 and Civ 5 are still in the top 100 most active games on Steam, despite their sequels being out. I have no way of figuring out DLC sales, so I’d assume that these games also have additional sales based on that. There’s also GTA online, NBA 2k online, and Red Dead online, all of which are fairly popular. TakeTwo has other games as well, but these are the most popular. Clearly, GTA V is their bread and butter, but NBA and RDR2 are doing fairly well. GTA V is also #7 on twitch’s most popular games.

&#x200B;

**Other competitors:**

Taketwo has beaten earnings estimates for the last 3 quarters in a row. Their projected Q1 EPS is 0.56. EA and Activision both also beat earnings this quarter and we’re all aware of why: everyone is at home and bored out of their mind. Gaming is one of the few things that there is to do. Microsoft’s CEO stated recently that Xbox live use was almost at an all-time high. Furthermore, Ttwo isn’t as reliant as EA or Activision for yearly releases. I touched on this before, but GTA online, Red Dead online, and NBA 2k online generate tons of revenue for Taketwo in the form of microtransactions. NBA 2k online will be livestreamed on ESPN2, for example and it has 50 million users in China alone. GTA online has shown increasing revenue growth. 2019 Q4 has an increase of 54% in revenue from recurrent purchasers.

&#x200B;

**Financials:**

No long-term debt. Assets, revenues, and net income have been going up. They’ve continued to repurchase their stock.

&#x200B;

**However...** they're already at their ATH and they haven't had any big blockbuster release this quarter. Activation had COD drop meanwhile EA had nothing major. The big difference may just be revenue from microtransaction but I'm too stupid to figure out how to calculate that. IV is also fairly high right now for their options.

I threw two telcos in there: CMCSA and VOD. Both are undervalued imo. Intel is also heavily overlooked these days, and with today's dip, presents a unique opportunity. ALXN is a parma company that crushed their earnings despite working on non-covid related stuff, which is a strong statement to big investors that company is resilient.

For whatever reason, you retards seem particularly TA averse, so I will try to keep my pretty crayons to a minimum.

Firstly, [I have an included a graph of US equity fund flows cross-referenced with the graph of the SP500.](https://imgur.com/XG59MP1)

&#x200B;

[SP 500 vs Cumulative US Equity Fund Flows](https://preview.redd.it/hl3iwcf72fy41.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=08402ce620c2ee3dab513be2663ec3836ca7896f)

There are multiple ways to look at this graph, but for the sake of the argument, the darker blue line that represents Cumulative US Equity Fund Flows can be viewed as ""Smart Money positioning"". I.e., it represents just how bearish institutional investors are (notice that it is negative). Now, institutions have been bullish ever since we touched those sexy sexy march lows, but around May 1st a divergence has been growing between increasing equity pricing and the negative equity fund flows. It's almost as if Smart MoneyTM is anticipating something... Notice, every time one of these divergences has formed previously, either the SP500 or the funds flows has corrected as to converge. So for the next correction, who is wrong? Institutions or the irrationally bullish S&P? Fair question.

Next, let's take a look at the CBOE put/call ratio for yesterday ([May 11th](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/)). Taking a look at the PCR for equities, we find that it has been becoming increasingly bullish since march lows, and has reached its most bullish level (.50) since the peak on February 20th. What does this mean? Volume (not open interest) for calls on equities exceeded volume for puts by double. What happened last time this happened? It didn't end too well for bulls. Interesting that this bullish sentiment on equities is also arriving at a time when new BTFD retail investors are flooding into TD, Robinhood, etc. (Evidenced by a spike in equity holdings)

Ok, maybe these are micro-chasms of a larger argument, and can be easily dismissed. Sure. Let's take a look at [a chart of SPY](https://imgur.com/2KHX9W8), crayons aside, for all of you retards who are holding 300 calls that expire in may.

The SPY has only been able to break above 295 for 8 months in its history, and only after struggling. There is an immense amount of selling pressure that exists around the 295/6 level, as evidenced by the last two recent attempts to break it. As a bull, your thesis would be: ""In a time of economic dismay, with the GDP contracting, unemployment reaching record levels in record time, a wave of bankruptcies brimming on the horizon, the US economy staring down the barrel of a multi-decade deflationary spiral, I believe that the SP500 can return to historically overbought and unsustainable price levels piggybacking almost exclusively on monetary policy"", More power to you, and you know what, you'd have printed for the past two months with that thesis. But be wary of continued upside.

Maybe bulls will continue to make money. Maybe not. Feel free to correct me in the comments, I'm constantly trying to expand my understanding and am perfectly open to being wrong.

They are primarily in 7 different SEA markets, a historically difficult market to penetrate.

Let's financial numbers:

* Digital entertainment rev increased 245% YoY
* E-commerce rev increase 304% YoY
* Company has NO debt
* Reported a net loss of 1.46b -- attributed to sales, marketing, r&d, hiring additional employees (basically all the things you want for an aggressively growing company)


Their cash cow is this app called Free Fire. It's a battle royal game that is MASSIVELY popular in SEA. It was voted #1 game in the Google play store for 2019. This game attributes to 94.5% of their digital entertainment rev.

So I'm gonna get to the point because, from what I've read, most of you don't know how to read.

$FIT $9c August 21

$WW $30c July 17

Now for those that wanna know more and aren't blindly tossing their portfolios into calls and seeing what sticks...lets begin:

(Also because I do want to bore you, I'll be putting important sentences in bold so you can read it without *actually* reading it.)

**Who's seen huge groups of families out walking together or at least seen a lot more people on the street riding their bikes?**

I live in a very white neighborhood so around **4:30PM you'll see a shitload of foot traffic** appear out of nowhere because everyone just got off work and wants to get some ""fresh air."" In the early weeks of quarantine I predicted that these people would eventually get tired of their walks and find something better to do. But like all my other predictions, I was incorrect. These people have continued their walks. On top of that, I'm seeing them **outfitted with headbands and watches** now. These are the same people I've been *watching* for the past two months through my [front room window](https://youtu.be/Yzht2_41caU?t=133). I'd like to say Nike would be a good move but I'm still unsure. **I would, however, say something like FitBit**. **A lot of these middle aged people who are taking their kids on walks know they can't run miles on miles but love to see how many** ***steps*** **they're doing per day.**

""*OOOOH Timothy, honey, guess how many steps I did today?!""*

What tracks steps? A FitBit. My guess **is that eventually when things begin to normalize, we will see a lot of people migrate towards fitness.** According to some [schmucks that track shit](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit), **it takes around 60 days to develop a new habit**. We're nearing the 60 day mark for a lot of these state lock downs. That being said, there could potentially be loads of people with their newfound love for at-home fitness and tracking their steps, moving towards alternatives such as Weight Watchers and Planet Fitness in the coming months as things open.

If you're still not sold on FitBit for the reason that more people could potentially buy them in the future because of new habits, then at least look into what they've been doing. [FitBit's new Charge 4 has built-in GPS and other bells and whistles that could drive people towards the product.](https://cnet.com/news/fitbit-charge-4-review-gps-sleep-tracking-plus-its-pretty/) They're also paving the way for health-tracking technology and even going as far to [seek FDA clearance for AFib Detection](https://gizmodo.com/fitbit-plans-to-seek-fda-clearance-for-afib-detection-w-1843273948).

I would even wager to say that Weight Watchers could move sooner than expected. Reason for this is that people are trying to [combat weight gain](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/health/combat-weight-gain-quarantine-coronavirus-wellness/index.html) because a lot of people are eating their quarantine snacks before they can even get home from the store. So what can these people do if they can't afford treadmills (or they're all sold out)? I believe they'll head to Weight Watchers.

>With the kitchen now just steps away from many new home offices, some are worried about the “quarantine 15,” the extra few pounds that may be gained while being stuck at home stress-eating with no access to the local gym in an effort to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

It's still under the radar, but won't be for very long.

 

I went Friday to look at a gun, a model I've been putting off for a rainy day. Well, as soon as I got to Academy, I saw the counter was packed. A lot of their inventory was gone, and almost all the ammo. They said orders were being delayed by two weeks. So I went to two local gun shops a couple miles away. Both packed. The energy in these places were palpable. You could tell the owners & employees were swamped. They kept saying this was the craziest they've ever seen it, in different ways, every place I went. So I perused 5 local shops total, and 3 big retailers between Friday and Saturday: Academy, Sportsman W-house, Bass Pro. I finally got the one I was looking for, but half the reason I kept looking was to see if everywhere was the same thing. Biggest surprise.. ammo. Every single place was low on ammo. Most ar rifles were gone, saw a lot of people buying pistols. But I kid you not, every single one of the EIGHT places had the same exhausted story from the guys behind the glass. Academy and Bass both said they were giving two-week timeframes for backorder. And a story I heard in one of the local shops, a guy said he just got back from TX where the stores were being bought up, but didn't think it would be like that here.

 

Of course I was thinking of RGR stock, as they're really the only pure play right now on just firearms.

So I got home and started looking for stories across the country, in local stations about gun stores.. and found these, among others:

It's real, it's national and it's perhaps the biggest buying trend outside of toilet paper, only no one realizes it's happening yet. And the trend is going to have serious lasting power. Ruger is not only good quality for a decent price, but it's one of the most popular guns for first time buyers. Perfect for this specific environment, new buyers and people who just want stuff that works. They have the best capacity for ramping up production, compared to other smaller manufacturers. If stores need to order, they know they can order Ruger. It's also the only pureplay. S&W got acquired by AOBC, and there are no other liquid instruments to express with, adding to the possible bottleneck of speculators into RGR. Very importantly, Ruger has no debt. They are well equity capitalized. They fit the perfect profile for a stock that can withstand a shock in which more indebted companies are having trouble right now. They're one of the only and perhaps from what I've seen with my own eyes, the most.. positively exposed product company for experiencing a windfall in revenue right now, and for the foreseeable months ahead.

 

Not only was this quarter a blowout, but the guidance going for Q2 is extremely elevated and in-turn, the 2020 yearly outlook as well. Try finding that kind of concentrated sales growth with already established gross and net margins on a non-debt balance sheet anywhere in the market right now. Nearly impossible. Most those other thematic trades don't have this kind of real world, concentrated healthy outlook, and actually make profit doing so.

I know what you're thinking...The Fed can't buy ETF's - well you're right and you're wrong. 

The Fed can't technically buy ETF's but they pretty much have to back stop the crippled debt markets. 

So The Fed decided it would stand up and fund a separate facility which had the ability to do what they are explicitly not allowed to...

It's a genius work around that hedge funds often do when they want tax advantages with offshore investors.

Today that facility started to buy HYD (Trust High Yield Municipal Index +.34%) and LQD (Investment Grade Corporate Bonds +1.15%).

The edge?

Great question...the market is thin on these, so my thesis is that early investors will benefit from jump-starting a market where the Fed is the consistent bidder.

The stock is up over the last month but is down over the last 7 days, making it a prime candidate to ride up towards earnings as its share price was over $41 just days ago. Any positive market news unrelated to the industry the stock should follow with some gains as well. It's important to know that they’ve been through the worst of it already. All the numbers are known. They aren’t at risk of going under right now. They have enough liquidity to weather the rest of the year without needing to issue debt.

#Plantronics Inc. (PLT)

Okay, so PLT needs an actual intro. Plantronics is an American electronics company producing audio communications equipment for business and consumers. Its products support unified communications, mobile use, gaming and music. [Their earnings is on May 21, 4:05pm.](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/plt). This company is is similar to [HEAR](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hear) a stock that rose from $6 to $11.50 in anticipation for earnings, was overbought and then had some pullback afterwards. Also note the rise that [LOGI is enjoying right now and has been for the last week](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/logi). This is why I'm telling you about these earning plays in advance, so we can play on the run-up, rather than buy high IV contracts the day before earnings and have the potential to lose our money. Regardless, [here's some juicy numbers on why I think they'll beat earnings.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/poly-provides-business-update-301040748.html). The tl;dr is that they've raised guidance to the top end of guidance from the previous earnings release and could possibly blow past that. In addition to this they suspended their quarterly dividend which shows some good faith when it comes to maintaining their liquidity (and saves them $25m/yr) and deferred any debt repayments until Q1 2021 (comes from their 8-K filed on 4/15). [The current consensus on the target price for PLT shares between all analysts is $18.00 per share](https://dbtnews.com/2020/05/11/plantronics-inc-plt-is-currently-13-06-below-its-200-period-moving-avg-what-dose-this-mean/) as of May 11th. 

There were some supply chain disruptions (facility shutdowns) in Mexico due to covid19 that were supposed to be closed 4/14 through 4/30, so they should be back online now. As of right now they have $226m in liquidity so no risks of financial trouble at the moment. All in all, a good solid earnings about to come from them and should see a nice run up to earnings and even maybe a pop the day after. $15c 6/19 is the recommended play. Because June 19th is pretty far away these contracts have a sweet delta and low theta those of us who are getting in early enough before IV crush kills our play.

\- Negative EPS every year.  In fact, EPS has been decreasing every year.  (-0.9, -2.29, -2.81, -5.63, -10.68)

\- Negative free cash flow every year and it also has been decreasing every year.  

\- Increasing debt load in the last 3 years.

**OVERVIEW**

Palo Alto Networks is the global leader in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity solutions are in high demand as everyone works from home and the world goes digital. Comps like Fortinet and Cloudflare have filled gaps since falling to their recent lows and have risen beyond pre-Covid highs, but PANW has so far been lagging behind. I expect a nice run up to ER on 5/21 (lots of time!) and excellent guidance.

**KPI**

The name of the game is recurring revenue. Software companies pivoting to this business model see the most success. For PANW, revenue is made up of product (legacy hardware) and services. Billings (Revenue + change in deferred revenue for the period) is a non-GAAP metric for SaaS companies that more effectively tracks its actual revenue increase because it accounts for the differences in the way its two components are used in GAAP accounting.

In PANW's most recently reported quarter, the company saw 

Product Revenue: (9%), 

Service Revenue: +30%

Billings: +17%

PANW explains that it literally asked and incentivized its staff to sell more services rather than legacy  hardware because they are shifting their business model to focus on recurring revenue. But this is only a short-lived downside because we are seeing growth in the right places - more billings.

Additionally, PANW has an enormous marketing spend that it has been deploying to get its new business lines out to clients. This has been crumbling its operating margin, but when you are the largest player in your sector and are switching your business model to selling recurring revenue products, I think this marketing spend is fully justifiable and will downtrend soon, especially with the string of acquisitions PANW has taken on (most recently CloudGenix) to fuel recurring revenue growth. 

**TRACTION**

Even with the fall in product revenue and huge marketing spend, PANW has been beating on EPS the last few quarters. Growing comps like FTNT, NET, have taken off, reporting tremendous growth this quarter not expected for such a large and established player like PANW. However, with PANW's new lines of business and huge marketing spend at the right time due to Covid, I think we will be in for a surprise and superior guidance. 

The recent CloudGenix acquisition is also favorable because it closed amidst the pandemic and compliments the move into cloud services and WFH software capabilities (CloudGenix uses SD-WAN, which makes this easier) for recurring revenue growth, showing strength. Also, a $1bn share buyback initiated last year to supplement a $1bn share buyback from the year before has not been suspended amidst Covid, displaying more strength. 

If smaller, growing companies with less channel partners and sales network were able to deploy their new products out during Covid, I believe an established player like PANW with large marketing focus and acquisitions for the relevant cybersecurity offerings will be able to do the same and should not be slept on. 

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** PANW is a powerhouse in cybersecurity, has been beating even with falling legacy hardware sales and increase marketing spend, been actually improving in the right places and achieving more recurring revenue growth at these costs, also making the right acquisitions for Covid-relevant offerings, still a while till ER 5/21.

2563,Discussion,My Prediction for the market after correctly calling the COVID Crash and Bottom,205,gifdwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gifdwc/my_prediction_for_the_market_after_correctly/,197,1589332141.0,"The fundamentals and the “feel” of the markets are broken right now. Just like Goldman Sachs announced yesterday (5/11/2020), I think that there is a very good chance of a second crash coming to the markets.

So far, I trust my gut. I've been correct many, many times so far. In early January, I knew the market was coming down. On February 2nd, I even made a video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRmJPgljdG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRmJPgljdG4)) to sell stonks. I got laughed at.

Turns out, a few weeks later exactly what I said would occur happened. Early March, Markets Crashed \~30%. Based on a text I sent on Sunday, March 22, I said “I don’t see it dropping much further.” I came to this conclusion because I got news alerts that “Powell: Federal Reserve Pledges Unlimited Quantitative Easing to Keep Markets Functioning” and gut feeling the CARES ACT was nearing from drafting to negotiation phase. I bought, and told people to buy now.

Enough humble bragging. As soon as this happened, the FED bailed out the market. **RULE #1**: DON'T FIGHT THE FED.

Anyway, the next day (Monday, March 23rd) the Fed did come in. Since that day, the Markets have “recovered”.

The markets are going to experience a second dip. Since early April, I’ve expected a “W” recovery rather than a “V”, “U” or “√” recovery. Every day we move on, the more confident I become. Here are some reasons I predict a second dip:

1. States will issue a second lockdown phase. High chance this may happen very soon (people freak out over confirmed cases/deaths next week as there is a 2week incubation period) or a spike in the fall. Prediction: 50%.
2. The shutdown is dragged out way too long. States are crazy enough to extend until mid June. Who’s gonna stop them from shifting the goalposts into August, November, 2021? I see draconian states being crazy enough to do this. Prediction: 100%.
3. People will realize unemployment numbers are not “temporary”, but permanent. The market seems to expect a quick bounce in the unemployment numbers, but I truly do not think this will happen. Prediction: 95%.
4. Consumer spending/demand does not return. I see Q2 financial reports being a much bigger dumpster fire than predicted. April is expected to be bad, but May and June are expected to be a return to normal. I do not see this. Prediction: 80%.
5. Edit (added):  I can see the Fed's current actions being blocked by the courts. They plan on direct violation of the Federal Reserve Act by buying bonds from companies. This is illegal and should not happen. Prediction: 50%

With one of these  or a mix of these happening, I see a second dip in July/August.

What will cause this second dip to recover? The Fed. Markets will keep falling, until then they drop \~20% and the Fed comes back again.

I predict the Fed will announce negative interest rates. President Trump wants this so badly, and it's one of the most powerful tools the Fed has to pump the market. I don’t even think the market needs to dip again for this to happen in the near future.

I predict this will happen before the election. (September/October). Once this happens, there is no stopping how high stocks will go. As the great Warren Buffett says “Interest rates are like gravity in valuation. If interest rates are nothing, values can be almost infinite. If interest rates are extremely high, that's a huge gravitational pull on value”.

Get those financial news apps installed on your phone ASAP. Fox Business, CNBC, etc. I DON'T CARE. Even if my prediction of a second dip is wrong, as soon as you hear that the Fed announces negative interest rates, go ALL IN. I won't tell you what stocks to buy, but as I said before: **DON'T FIGHT THE FED**.

tl;dr is that I predict negative rates in the near future to pump the markets. Once that happens, SPY calls all day.

**Short interest is 19%** (9.6 million shares on 54 million outstanding and \~1.9 million average volume) which is likely leading to the squeeze we are seeing now but it has great potential long term. 

UNFI is the largest publicly-traded grocery distributor in the states. A couple of years ago they had some massive missteps. Chief among them was, in an effort to reduce their reliance on Whole Foods/Amazon, they acquired Supervalue at a crazy price and taking on billions of debt, this acquisition meant they picked up a lot of new clients and reduced Amazons share of their business from 50% to less than 25%. Within a year Wall Street responded to their continuous misses in earnings and they dropped in value over 80%. Their market value going from being in the tens of billions to less than half a billion. 

Fast-forward a couple of years and things have started to get better (they had their first positive earnings report just a couple months ago!), they’ve created an OK debt repayment plan and started shedding parts of the Supervalue acquisition they do not need. Then they stumble into Covid19 and are now printing money. 

They did incredibly well during the first wave peak of the pandemic, an update in mid- March reporting weeks of Thanksgiving/Christmas level sales. Assuming that continued through March and most of April that is a huge boost for them, with more likely to come if a 2nd wave hits. There is positive sentiment that their June earnings report may be as good if not better than their last positive one. 

As part of their Supervalu acquisition they picked up a ton of grocery stores, they shed some but still had over 80 at last check. During the pandemic while other companies were reducing hours UNFI decided to make most locations **open 24 hours**!

 With all that said I hesitated and sold my May 15 $12.50 calls (23 of them) for .15 on Monday....fuck. If I had held I could have sold for \~$2.70 each today. (-$6,000)

Currently I am still **holding [June $12.50 Calls \(15 of them\)](https://imgur.com/a/jFyyeow) and nearly 1,500 in shares** (this stock used to be worth in the 70s under better times). I plan to exit half of my options if the share price exceeds $22. 

Some people have said this would make a good acquisition by Amazon to control the supply chain. In the short term I disagree as UNFI still seems to disorganized for Amazon to take on the mountain of work still needing to be done.

Forget to add that the CEOs partipcation in BMO Capital Markets Hosts Virtual 15th Annual Farm to Market Conference tommorow is also affecting the price. People are hoping he speaks to increased sales over the last two 
 Preliminary Q3 guidance just got released an hour ago…it is nothing short of amazing. **“Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.40 beats by $0.90; GAAP EPS of $1.60 beats by $1.24 . Revenue of $6.67B (+11.9% Y/Y) beats by $480M.”**

**Update- Alright, i'm out! Sold 1853 shares for $36K then sold my options at varying points for a total of 11K. Overall up 26K. Did miss out on another 20K in profit when I sold my 23 May 15th $12.50 calls on Monday for 15 cents instead of $8-9 today. I will buy back in if it goes below $16.

FY2014 EPS $0.18

Not only are they forecasting the highest EPS in DHT company history but the Q1 EPS for 2020 is higher than 4 of 6 yearly EPS from 2014 - 2019

This stock is severely underpriced. Target price is $9

Tankers are being drug through the mud due to oil speculation and possible hedge funds punishing the 5/15 option holders.

This makes me feel confident to hold and buy this dip.

DHT also booked a vessel at 75K today for May 27th voyage. Much higher than the 50k rates which are already in their own absurdly high compared to typical industry rates of prior years.

Stay strong tanker bro’s

Global pandemic isn't the time to trigger the money under the mattress instincts of some paranoid sectors. This sounds super dangerous, psychologically. I get it that people prefer credit cards and paying electronically, but if people remove all their savings and keep just a little change, this will still be bad. Go ahead and explain the economic reasons to the guns hoarding nut jobs.

Also you need to remember bank runs are snowballing and contagious. If you hear about your redneck neighbor bank running, and he's not alone, the smart thing to do is to bank run too before there's nothing left in it.

EDIT: ""run on the banks"" simply means getting your cash out of the bank, and keeping it in person. Not some mad raid some autists here are imagining.

I'm holding shares and I plan to for at least 6 months, but I just want to know if I'm missing something.  Their Q1 2020 ER was on May 7, and in the weeks trading up to it was high as $12 and on May 6 it was $9.6

With the May 7 ER they announced a dividend of $1.10 (0.29 for Q4 2019 + 0.81 for Q1 2020) due to monstrous Q1 2020 (about as much as the entirety of 2019). The dividend record date is May 29 and June 16 (for Q4 and Q1).

*Why* has the stock traded flat compared to the day before earnings?  Assuming the market values EURN at $10, should it be rising to about $11 for the expected dividend(s)?

I don't think a massive beat / dividends was priced in either because they **beat EPS estimates by like 40%**.  I'm trying to wrap my mind around this but it just doesn't add up.  As things stand right now, if the market does value EURN at $10 then just holding the stock for 5 weeks guarantees a 10% return

Q2 is supposed to be insane too because

>So far in the second quarter of 2020, the Euronav VLCC fleet operated in the Tankers International Pool has earned about USD 95,000 per day and 71% of the available days have been fixed.

You get the idea, all the regional banks that offered loans out to people with low down payments, bad credit and on real estate with questionable appreciation are now feeling the heat. The big boy lenders were only lending out to 700+ credit 20% down, these guys however were not doing that and now they are screwed. 8% forbearance and climbing, 20-30% unemployment, a lot of this is retail/service industry that will not be bouncing back as companies are going under.  These workers that saved up enough to buy a house they can barely afford will be foreclosing just like in 08/09, the banks that serviced the loans will best case scenario take a major hit, worst case bankruptcy.  

To make it worse, the regional banks don't have new revenue coming in, people aren't applying for new lines of credit (at least not successfully..), new home loans aren't being issued unless you have massive cash reserves and diamond credit, in short these guys aren't making any money now or in the next 3-6 months.

This company went up 5% today (5/11)

Their earnings are tomorrow AH.

Having looked through as many posts as I can find in regards to people discussing the product quality, it's rarely positive.

I looked through the quarterly earnings and this is what I got from the previous two:

September 2019: MC 2379.342; Cash 232427; Debt 84426; Enterprise Value: -145622; Cash-Debt: 148001

More recently December 2019: MC 1946.702; C 291604; D 172903; EV: -116754; C-D: 118701

So my thinking is they're on a downward trend and are going to continue to not meet the current expectation tomorrow AH, leading to a correction from the current pump.

In an ideal world, they would slowly be introduced back into the market once it's ""standing on it's own"" again, whatever the fuck that means. 

Except I don't think this is possible.

Now here they are *again* holding the fucking bag that's looking to be multiples bigger.  If they even mention the possibility of selling this dogshit, the market is gonna crash.  So what's the plan? Is there even a plan?  I haven't seen this mentioned once and I'm hoping the wsb hivemind can soothe my fears.  

My personal opinion is they will inflate the mother of all bubbles to stave off a debt market collapse for possibly a few years which will crush all the bears’ hopes.  By then, the balance sheet will be around 10-12 trillion and rates will be a 25 bps negative.  At this point, the Fed will *actually be out of ammo*.  When the next disruption hits, I'm not really sure what they can do from there.  That's when the mother of all crashes happens and it's probably guns and ammo time.

It doesn't matter if your *particular* governor has authorized his inbred trucker hat constituents to go eat tactical camo glazed donuts on their way to buy more camouflaged AK47 bayonets at Wally's Spandex and Muffin Top Emporium of the Soon to be Diseased, or if she has doubled down on the lockdown of the her trembling thick-rimmed dreadlocked lesbian artisanal salt enthusiast denizens.  If covid went away in two weeks, it **wouldn't matter.**

Unemployment doesn't mean shit to the markets right now. Unemployment money enthusiastically purchases yolos just as well as doing something for a living money does.  More, maybe.  But it DOES matter to states.  Because they have to pay for it, and right now it is absolutely gutting every other state program.  Nothing else matters.  States MUST pay it, or shit collapses, so everything else is on the chopping block.

[Endowments are damaged](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-northwestern-university-finances-coronavirus-20200511-k4vv5mhkxnctdhtkjkaqqhrrxa-story.html), and in any case must be drawn from in a way that doesn't draw on the principal of the endowment.

Research grants, a large percentage of any reputable schools funding, are being completely paused while every discipline even tangentially related to the well being of human beings is reassigned to COVID research.

And that leaves the elephant in the room. **Enrollment.**

Contrary to popular belief, universities DO NOT sell education.  Not anymore, not for a long time.  Universities sell ""lifestyle experiences"". Who gives a fuck about Quadrilateral Phase Induction 214 when you can pay massively inflated rates to drink shit beer with your other degenerate friends and find out, once and for all if you really ARE into the way asshole tastes when it's been marinating in axe body spray and barely post pubecent sweat for the last two days.  And it is MASSIVELY expensive.  This is because smart people decades ago found out that the best way to extract money from little Timmy isn't to have him firing 12 million dollar rockets at brown people until his leg is gnawed off by a Lesser Vagigated Jungle Rape Scorpion, but instead to saddle him with huge, nondefaultable debt while he puts his underwhelming peach fuzzed willy into any willing moving thing.

And they can't do ANY of that online.  Estimates indicate that enrollment will drop by a VERY substantial number if classes are moved online. And they will be.

So how, you ask, can we short the schools and profit off of the misfortune of Middle American Teenagers, as is the FUCKING AMERICAN WAY for monied people and those that aspire to them?  We can't place puts on *colleges!*

Right you are, my young and intrepid friend.  But we can short student support services.

And that brings me, finally, to American Campus Communities, Inc. Options are still cheap.  Buy it for the fall time, because by then, this is going to be headline news every fucking day. Or if you're cheap buy it for the summer time.  Doesn't matter, puts will print.

I know you're not used to waiting that fucking long to go eat some free McDonald's, but you're sure as fuck going to be able to eat a lot of it.

Positions at the end of this post, you fucking rockstars.

It's no other than New Relic, competitor to big time winner Datadog.

**What New Relic Does and how do they make money?**

New Relic helps track performance for various software applications and services. They make money by charging for the number of hosts. For those who aren't in tech, this means that they make more money as internet traffic increases as long as their customers are getting part of that increase in traffic. If their customers have more traffic, they will have most hosts which means New Relic makes more money ([https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring/pricing?utm\_medium=PS&utm\_term=2021-Q1&utm\_offer=new%20relic%20pricing&utm\_device=c&utm\_type=Brand-Website-Brand\_Keywords-AMER-Search&utm\_source=GAMER-BRAND-000&gclid=CjwKCAjwte71BRBCEiwAU\_V9h8IhrQa2iUf5k6IArpxYPRp2V8\_S-s55nVhztoHLswlwA-X1sjUq3hoCs4gQAvD\_BwE](https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring/pricing?utm_medium=PS&utm_term=2021-Q1&utm_offer=new%20relic%20pricing&utm_device=c&utm_type=Brand-Website-Brand_Keywords-AMER-Search&utm_source=GAMER-BRAND-000&gclid=CjwKCAjwte71BRBCEiwAU_V9h8IhrQa2iUf5k6IArpxYPRp2V8_S-s55nVhztoHLswlwA-X1sjUq3hoCs4gQAvD_BwE)).

**Is there proof New Relic is going to do well?**

In fact, there is! Datadog (my most recent trade) went up 30%+ since last week, and Dynatrace, another competitor, has also been up since. This is mainly because the application monitoring industry as a whole wins from the increase in traffic, not only specific companies.

**Why New Relic?**

In full disclosure, New Relic is down this year because before coronavirus they projected revenues would go down. However, since that time, the landscape has changed a ton, and I do not believe their slowing in revenue applies anymore, especially since their reporting will include the months of March and April. It's especially a good time to buy considering they went down a ton today, and you can get them at a discount. Additionally, New Relic has been moving more towards future industry trends, which they have lagged in in the past. Competitors have been ahead of the curve to adopt AI and ml as core parts of their monitoring services and over the past year New Relic has invested a lot in making sure they do not fall behind. ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/04/19/new-relic-announces-the-general-availability-of-aiops-platform/#180bb7c1eaa6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/04/19/new-relic-announces-the-general-availability-of-aiops-platform/#180bb7c1eaa6))

**Conclusion**

This trade really comes down to the fact that I believe that mostly all companies in this specific industry should go up. Dynatrace and Datadog have already reported and beat earning expectations. I forsee New Relic doing that same, and I think it is a good time to invest to buck on the trend in a company that is not valued as highly as its peers.

tldr: more internet traffic; buy New Relic

I predict that renewable energy, most notably solar will have an explosive growth in the next month and years. With the entire world on lockdown, we see pictures of once heavily polluted cities are now very clear and clear of smog. We have to accept that oil is becoming a commodity of the past and renewable energy will take over the future. This lockdown will be that catalyst for consumers to go green. Hydrogen powered vehicles, solar power energy, and self sustainable ways to harvest energy is becoming increasingly attractive in the media. 

==============================================================

Taken from a user on Stocktwits named WantedtoRetireEarly: 

Good comment from a solar installer: ""We've had to field more calls in the last month than I can remember in any April. We've made three sales with no contact with customers. It think the pandemic brings out the ""preper"" in people. Also, Tesla's solar tiles don't compete with anybody. They are a premium product and require special training to install. They also are integrated into the roof so maintenance and trouble-shooting is a bit more complicated. On that note Generac's inverter/battery offerings are a potential competition, but if you call them (I have numerous times) they don't have anyone who has information to give you on the technical aspects of an installation of their product line, specifically a retrofit for AC coupling of an existing PV installation. Finally, **Enphase's battery offing is whole house (up to 150 amps). SolarEdge's battery offering is only up to 25 amps per 7.6k inverter. I expect Enphase to overtake SE in the battery market when it becomes available.**""

Yesterday, an article was released **""Trump Administration Approves Largest U.S. Solar Project Ever""** 

U.S. Department of the Interior [approved](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-approves-plan-largest-solar-project-us-history) this week the biggest solar project in the United States ever—an estimated US$1-billion solar plus battery storage project in Nevada. The project will consist of a 690-MW photovoltaic solar electric generating facility plus a battery storage facility. The project will be the world’s eighth-largest solar power facility and is expected to generate enough electricity to power 260,000 homes in the Las Vegas area and potential energy markets in Southern California, the Department of the Interior said. The Gemini project is expected to be built in two phases, with the first phase coming online in 2021 and final completion as early as 2022, the Department of the Interior said. The on-site construction workforce is expected to average 500 to 700 workers, with a peak of up to 900 workers, supporting up to an additional 1,100 jobs in the local community and injecting an estimated US$712.5 million into the economy in wages and total output during construction, the Interior said, at a time when [more than 20 million Americans](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Holds-Gains-Despite-Massive-Unemployment.html) have already lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said, commenting on the project’s approval:

“**The solar industry is resilient and a project like this one will bring jobs and private investment to the state when we need it most**. We appreciate the work that the Trump Administration has done to make this historic project a reality.”

“Gemini offers the **opportunity to showcase, at an unprecedented scale, what we believe to be one of the most promising technological advances in coupling battery storage to utility scale solar power to produce low cost renewable energy over the long term**,” [said](https://www.quinbrook.com/post/blm-doi-issue-final-record-of-decision-for-milestone-690mwgemini-solar-battery-storage-in-nevada) David Scaysbrook, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Quinbrook.

Barclays analyst Moses Sutton raised the firm's price target on Enphase Energy to **$80 from $76 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares following the company's Q1 results**.

Europe - **doubled revenue over Q4. Tripled sales force.** Spain, Netherlands, Belgium Germany all exciting. Asia and Latin America are seeing revenue increases. Australia is seeing expansion but they expect a slow down in the region but they believe we are well positioned to do well in the long term.  


New products: Engineers have been working hard to implement remote debugging. Shelter in place did impact overall engineering and were unable to ship beta units at end of Q1. They are shipping now and expect to have revenue in Q2.  


IQ8 will be launched by Q4 and IQ8D for two panels is coming along well. Their solar panels will be **97.5% efficient.** Another big initiative: **Digital transformation**. Looking to develop a comprehensive digital platform for both homeowners and installers. When done right, it will serve as a **powerful catalyst to launch further sales. Expect to make significant progress in this area in 2020.** 

&#x200B;

ENPH has been experiencing explosive growth pre-coronavirus era going from a $2 stock in 2018 to $59.09 in March 2020 and now they rallied up to $65 just two days ago and is now sitting at $58. Their balance sheet is pretty healthy, and they're expecting to continue to increase their revenue. Their estimated EPS growth next year is 38.80% but I'm 100% sure its going to be way more. As per Finviz, their annual EPS Growth in the past years is **53.50%,** annual sales growth in the past 5 years **12.70%,** quarterly revenue growth is **105.10**, and quarterly earnings growth is **2393.20%.** ENPH was also recently added to the S&P midcap growth 400. I project this stock will skyrocket to $200 in the next 1-2 years and possibly >$300 within 5 years. Right now, I currently have 11 contracts for ENPH $65 C 6/19 since I'm playing on this currently rally, and will continue to add in increments for longer dated calls for a long term investment. SEDG and TAN are good stocks as well but I currently like ENPH for the growth.

It's just a small buy for now, but I could see this alleviating some of the pressure on the front-month contract: 

&nbsp;

>The U.S. Energy Department said Wednesday that it has released a ""Request for Proposals"" to buy up to one million barrels of sweet crude oil to test the conditions of physical oil available to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

>The department plans to buy oil sourced from small to midsize U.S. oil producers and delivery will be made to one or more of the three SPR storage sites during July, with early deliveries accepted in June. The purchase would complement deliveries of crude that are currently scheduled for June or July under the Energy Department's oil storage initiative that was launched in April. 

>For the week ended May 8, 1.9 million barrels of crude oil was added to the SPR to total 639.8 million barrels. The reserve's current storage capacity is 713.5 million barrels. June West Texas Intermediate crude clj20 traded at $25.61 a barrel in electronic trading, up from the $25.29 Nymex settlement.


&nbsp;

Basically the government is trying to intervene and buy oil so that small/midsize producers don't have to stop pumping and don't have to store it.  Given the way these government programs have worked so far this year, I have no confidence that's actually how this will work, even if that's the moderate form of intervention. They'll get sold into by big oil, or get sold futures oil deliveries.

Note the part where they accept early deliveries in June? So who's going to lowball a bid, buy up a million barrels of front-month futures this month or next, and get paid to deliver dirt-cheap futures contract overflow to the government?

If a small oil company doesn't leverage that trade opportunity they're stupid. And I bet you this is just the start of what the government buys. Might even be able to prop up part of the stock market with it too - the S&P was tracking oil hard a couple times today.

If the government starts buying for real, futures oil will never go below spot price, unless it's by the marginal cost of delivery. Who would sell for less if you could buy futures and sell at spot to the government?

Yeah this is all conjecture-level DD but maybe it will give you guys some interesting ideas on how it will impact prices and how to play it.

&nbsp;

Edit: According to [this link](https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-executes-direction-president-trump-announces-solicitation-purchase-crude) buying up to the capacity of the Strategic Oil Reserve has been in the works for a while. Not sure how I missed that, all I'd seen previously was Trump's offer to let private companies store oil in government facilities temporarily, hadn't heard about the plan to buy to capacity.

That means that 1 million barrels is definitely just to get the ball rolling, and they'll be buying another 69+ million barrels in the near future on Trump's orders.",2020-05-14 04:52:45,1.0,0.0,-0.13544310344827587,0.288185632183908

Here is some spicy information on some obscure companies you probably dont know much about. I am a type 1 diabetic pump user and therefor have integral knowledge about these companies and their products. 


I will try to make this brief and leave out the bull shit. These companies get a large percentage of their profits from providing supplies every month to diabetics. I use the Medtronic 670g system. My costs per month without insurance is $970 for my CGMS.. $300 for pump reservoirs.. and $150 for infusion sets. And incase you missed it this is the costs PER MONTH.


Now you ask me why should you give a shit? Well because being a diabetic in America was unaffordable during the best of times when everyone had a stable job and insurance. Now we will have people losing insurance big time do to lack of jobs. They will eventually go on medicaid since it was expanded by the ACA for people who have low income. There are also rumors of these companies providing free supplies during the epidemic for those who need it. They are afraid of the public backlash if they let diabetics die because of lack of supplies. 

Combine this with the potential of Democrats winning the elections this fall. (highly speculative) i believe if they do then universal healthcare will become a serious consideration. This will all but assure profit losses because they will need to abide by the single payer rates.

2626,DD,DD: Home Depot HD $237.5 Call 5/29,107,gjam0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjam0i/dd_home_depot_hd_2375_call_529/,101,1589441750.0,"First post so please don't tear me apart like JPOW did my asshole today with his big red dildo. I've been scanning forums for the last  last few weeks and have seen a lot of different opinions/DD's on stores with earnings next week like  Home Depot and Lowes. Figured I'd give you my 2 cents since that is all I have left after today. (For the lazy fucks/people that can't read- scroll to bottom for TL;DR)

&#x200B;

HD took a beating today which is also why it's the best time to get in before earnings next week on May 19. When you  look at the 1 month graph, they have strongly trended upward about $30. Their 52 week high was $247 in February (currently trading at $230). It was gaining some solid momentum before yesterday afternoon when everything took a dump. I think they will beat earnings and continuously gain momentum within the next week approaching their earnings date for a variety of reasons:

1) Long lines.... . I'm a licensed contractor/real estate agent and have gone to Home Depot almost 4-5 days of the week, every single week, for the past 4 years. I have never seen anything like this. Phones ringing like crazy, out of stock on items consistently, (could be supply chain issue but the second they get in certain items its gone the within a week), 2 hour lines inside, cashiers stressing out, (honestly need more staff), and then there's the line OUTSIDE lol. 

2) ReAl eStAtE mArKeT iS cRaShIng... a lot of other posts I'm reading that are shitting on my beloved Home Depot have stated that people don't want to list homes bc they don't want sick ppl walking through their house, fewer home sales, and that this is only temporary bc ppl are stuck indoors and have nothing better to do than change their old shitty sink faucet to a nice new shiny one so they can impress their wife so she doesn't keep running off w her new boyfriend... very wrong, but my own thoughts:

\- Nobody listing homes- wrong. I have done more than 20 showings in the past week. My email is flooded with inquiries for showings right now. Homes are cheaper, some people need cash now, and others just don't care about the new flu. People will simply put masks and gloves on, and typically the homeowner will greet you outside, ask you politely not to touch everything and let you walk through the home and check it out. People are still looking to move throughout all this especially because homes are getting a little cheaper. 

&#x200B;

\-The Rich get Richer- Home prices have gone down since COVID-19 without a doubt, but nothing even remotely close to the 2008 crash. This is the perfect opportunity for investors to come in and buy what they can so they can get cheap properties and flip them (half of fucking real estate anyway). I personally work in the wonderful shit hole of Detroit and see it on a daily basis with multiple groups of foreign investors asking to put their money into the US bc their markets are complete ass and they don't trust their economies (typically South America investors we have been dealing with). We know multiple other companies that received a very strong influx of investors asking to put their $ (from 500k to 10 million in the last 2 weeks) into the US real estate market bc its getting cheaper and it recently has been on an upward trend. Granted, Detroit is a bit different but this week we sold a 50 pack of homes to an investor that has now hired 30 different crews of contractors to go in and flip those homes...... guess where they're getting their supplies from?!

&#x200B;

 3) Whos Buying?- Everyone... everyone from the Boomers finally getting around to their home project while under quarantine, general contractors still renovating their projects, older people in the gardening section picking out a fancy new plant to put in their kitchen window, to the younger couples buying some random ass high-end home appliance or lawn-mower they can't afford for their new home they aren't paying mortgages on.

&#x200B;

4) tHE LiNeS aRe LoNg bEcAuSe iT hAs lImIteD capacity- YES bears, for fuckssake we know that there is limited capacity in the Home Depot stores but that doesn't stop people from going there (and good job, so does every other fucking store in the world right now).  There are also other posts under /r HomeDepot speaking about how multiple stores have beat their weekly goals by $400k.... I was bitching to my buddy who is also a manager at a local HD about how they keep running out of a specific flooring and paint that  I use and he told me when they get a shipment, it comes in and flys off the shelves within hours and that they have had online orders that they have to fill so a lot of items are consistently gone... also told me they have crushed their sales on a weekly basis since COVID started and have not had a down week since it was shut down for one week in March...  Another benefit to the ""Limited Capacity"" is that this will be spoken about during their Guidance and how they are actually OBEYING (\*\*cough cough Papa Musk\*\*) the actual laws that were implemented and are STILL selling out of things, crushing weekly goals, and staying busy every.single.day....

&#x200B;

5) Home Depot Pro-  For those of you that don't know what Home Depot Pro  is... its pretty much PornhubPremium except free!. You get exclusive savings, discount coupons, business tools, purchase tracking,  detailed online receipts/login, and specific customer support line. Free to sign up and multiple managers at the Pro Desks have told me there has been a significant increase in Home Depot Pro signups in the last month. 

&#x200B;

Home Depot has had a very steady increase for the past 5 years. This month it was approaching ATH until yesterday. No doubt in my mind that this will surpass the ATH once earnings come out. I can't see it dropping much further and loaded up on calls at the end of the day while it was low. This will definitely continue to trend upward next week as earnings date approaches.  Again, just my 2 cents from what I have seen on a daily basis compared to the last few years of religiously going to Home Depot day in and day out.

Earnings May 28th

TL;DR – Overall looking bullish on DG as main customer base becomes more reliant than ever on stretching budgets on essential items during COVID and mass unemployment. Calls on DG; watch WMT (earnings on 5-19) to get an idea of what could happen to DG.

Hello WSB; my thesis is that as DG approaches earnings they will be testing all-time highs and that DG proves to be a reliable company during COVID for their value focused customers.

All of the information that I am sharing with you is found in their 10K statement.

Dollar General is the largest discount retailer in America, they have about 16000 stores and operate in 45 states. They strive to offer a broad selection of products at low prices (typically $10 or less). A majority of the customers are value focused and rely on low or fixed income.

Main challenges that DG faces in maintaining low prices are: 1.) trade policy and 2.) receipt of goods offered by DG. 

1.)  Historically, DG has shown that tariffs on products from China as applied to direct imports and domestic purchases did not have a net material impact on financial results in 2019. DG believes they can mitigate potential sales and margin impact of such increased tariffs on financial results in 2020 through various sourcing, merchandising and pricing efforts. However, it should be noted that changes in trade policy can result in higher prices for customers which will have a negative impact upon budgets, spending. 

2.)  There is limited insight into the extent to which business may be impacted by COVID and there are many unknowns. While DG currently expects delays in the receipt of certain goods in 2020 as a result of COVID, they do not anticipate a material impact to financial results in 2020 due to these delays.

To support other operating priorities, DG remains focused on capturing growth opportunities. In 2019, DG opened 975 new stores, remodeled 1024 stores, and relocated 100 stores. For 2020 DG plans to open 1000 new stores, remodel 1500 stores and relocate 80 stores for a total of 2580 real estate projects.

DG has paid a quarterly cash dividend since 2015. On March 11, 2020 the Board of Directors announced an increased amount of the quarterly cash dividend to $0.36 beginning with the dividend payable on April 21, 2020. The Board expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends. Further, DG intends to continue their share repurchase activity in 2020.

The following information was gathered form the DG website and point to DG remaining resilient during COVID.

\-  Between March 14th and April 30th DG has hired more than 43000 individuals with thousands of more applicants and candidates going through the interviewing and hiring process.

\-  An additional $25 million was recently invested to employee bonuses

I see DG testing all-time highs in the coming weeks. All of this has made me bullish on value focused retail stores. A comparable company to watch is WMT, they put out earnings on May 19th.

Additional food for thought; since 2009 DG has only missed earnings 2 times and has had some pretty impressive gaps up following the day of reporting earnings.",2020-05-14 02:37:35,-0.9988,0.0,-0.21277931034482755,-0.4038597701149425

We made adjustments to our position on this news.** Here's a quick download of what was found in the paper:

**TL;DR:** The relatively clean safety sheet overall coupled with our expectation that the higher dose groups will be enriched for the complete responders once we get a deeper look on 5/29 has us confident that Allogene is triangulating on a relatively safe, highly efficacious dose to take forward into further development.

The ASCO abstracts including  Allogene's ALPHA trial abstract have been released. All in all the abstract supports our thesis for Allogene that we walked through in our recent write up, though we will need to wait for the 5/29 presentation for a more detailed look at the data. Key takeaways from the abstract include: 

1) No dose-limiting toxicities or GvHD observed: this is great news 

2) Only 2 (22.2%) of patients developed Grade 1 - 2 CRS, which resolved within 72 hours 

3) 78% ORR, including 3 complete responses.

The voting system is the best system we’ve had so far but it is flawed. It allows for a minority to take down a post while failing to consider how many upvotes it has. If a post has say 20 upvotes in 20 minutes, 2 people who dislike the post can come in and take it down entirely. In this system 2 autists is greater than 20 autists. People can appeal the vote but they are unlikely to do so since the post is already out of sight.

One could say I am writing this whole post because,”Reeeeee the WSB vote system took down my posts!” I would cede that my posts were taken down rightfully. The spam argument is a solid argument. But it was through the taking down of my posts that I noticed this flaw. I fear that future posts could be removed by a minority. 

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
 
•The vote bot should go away if a post has reached a certain threshold of upvotes. 

•The vote bot should have a disapprove AND approve option.

•I will reduce my spam

Lately there has been a growing number of people taking issue with my memes. Hence why I worry that a small minority could remove my posts in the future. I take a collage of images, and put it through a filter. Depending on the image I may do more than that, but that’s the basic formula. I have never claimed to have painted my images and I’ve been completely open about this.

Here are the main criticisms I’ve noticed, please let me know if I’m mistaken:

•My posts are low effort and generic

•My posts are spam

•My posts are self promotion 

MY POSTS ARE LOW EFFORT AND GENERIC

I wish I knew how to bold text on reddit then I could be like those cool DD posts. Yes, some of my posts are easy and made quickly. However, for others I spend hours making them. Overall, I autistically dedicate a majority of my time to making memes. The time it takes and the way a meme is made is ultimately insignificant, what matters is the end result. 99% of memes on WSB are low effort collages, some of the best memes are just pictures with text added to them. My point being, low effort does not translate to low quality and vice versa. 

As for my memes being generic, I would say that if it gets upvotes rather than downvotes that’s not the case. For the most part WSB has good eye for memes and only upvotes good memes. Here’s a comment that I think sums things up well and I feel this applies to all memes on WSB not just my content:

“You are documenting the saga of wsb through your illustrations, telling a story for the ages... conquest, victory, despair, defeat, comradery, gayness... someone from the outside would have no idea... but as an insider... the nuances... this is art man. This is the best sub on this whole piece of shit site and the haters don't even understand what they are hating.”

MY POSTS ARE SPAM

I’ve been doing about 1 post a day for over a month. As a result, I went from 500 karma to 150k in that same time period. I honestly can’t argue with that, I pretty much am spamming the sub and I will tone it down. This is a completely legitimate criticism. 

MY POSTS ARE SELF PROMOTION

Please go read the WSB rules on self promotion. I’ve checked multiple times and I am following them to the T. I talked with a mod about this a while back and they told me I was fine. I do not want to be violating any rules and if this is the case please let me know!",2020-05-14 00:26:15,-0.9997,0.4767,-0.0267,-0.18323333333333336

It's time to clap TQQQ's cheeks again! I clapped their cheeks today for a >10-bagger on 5/15 $63p's I bought yesterday. Now let's clap 'em some more.

Before we start, if you're new to the TQQQ clappening plays, read these threads first, otherwise this isn't going to make sense to you: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7im7t/bear_porn_205736_in_2_days/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8s1tc/tqqq_is_going_bust/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9au7j/tqqguh/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffsa0j/tqqq_blacked_monday_update/)



Alright, so here's the deal. Starting from late March, the boys over at Proshares started holding Treasury Bills in TQQQ. Your first thought may be ""That's smart, making a little bit of interest on their cash"", right? WRONG, because they're holding 0.000% coupons. So then, why the fuck are they buying these t-bills instead of just holding cash? Well, here it is:



As of 5/12/20:

Item|Value|Value x3
:--|:--|:--
Stock|5,255,716,719|
Net Other Assets / Cash|1,599,325,097|
T-bills|499,813,598|
Stock + cash|6,855,041,816|20,565,125,449
Stock + cash + t-bills|7,354,855,414|22,064,566,243
Swaps|11,797,617,452|
NQM0 Futures|312,744,720|
Leveraged Exposure|12,110,362,172|
Total Exposure|17,366,078,891|



So, their total collateral x3 appears to be $20,565,125,449 (or $22,064,566,243 if you include the t-bills), but their total exposure is only $17,366,078,891. Why the difference? If you're a smart cookie, at this point you're thinking ""Well they're probably repoing their T-bills for cash, so you should substract the value of the T-bills from the cash amount"". Ok then:



Item|Value|Value x3
:--|:--|:--
Stock + cash - T-bill|6,355,228,218|19,065,684,655


Hmm, still not right, there's a big difference between $19,065,684,655 and $17,366,078,891.


Here's the catch. Fuckers are counting the value of the T-bills AND the repo cash in ""Net Other Assets / Cash"". Cuz fuck you, that's why we call it ""other assets"". So really, it's 


Item|Value|Value x3
:--|:--|:--
Stock + cash - 2x T-bill|5,855,414,620|17,566,243,861



If you want to confirm that total exposure should be around 3x stock+cash you can just do the math on any older version of the holdings (check web archive). Eg as of 3/12/20
 

Item|Value|Value x3
:--|:--|:--
Stock + cash|$3,196,625,917|$9,589,877,753
Total Exposure|$9,602,961,802|



So why fudge the numbers? Probably because the Proshares intern that told them about these threads. They didn't like the army of wsb autists shorting their ass into the ground last time, and they think we're all retarded. Well fuck you, Proshares retards.

Are they really selling more or are they just busier due to the changes in consumer behavior? (Lines outside, more online orders for pickup, low ticket DIYers).

Everyone is stuck at home and doing home remodels so they go to HD to get paint or gardening supplies. But high dollar sales come from contractors / professionals and appliances, both of which are likely to be lower.

A few Realtors in my area (Central Texas) said that home sales are still strong but there’s also a lot fewer homes coming on the market.

We know March existing home sales were down 8.5%. April existing home sales will be out after earnings. 

People don’t want to list a home they are living in and have sick people walk through it for showings. Fewer big companies hiring mean fewer people moving cities. 

Fewer home sales mean fewer big remodels by contractors. 

DIYers might make a store look busy, but can they compensate for a steep decline in contractor sales? 

Are these bored DIYers going to also pick up the slack for the 40% of people earning under 40K that Powell said lost their jobs? 

Are those people going to continue to replace big ticket appliances? 

Overall I think the bad news will hit the stock hard if busy stores don’t translate into high ticket sales. With HD close to all time highs as we enter a depressed real estate market, I think there’s good downside since everyone is expecting great earnings due to the store being “busy”


Considering some longer dates puts but looking for your thoughts. 

Anyone work at local Home Depot store that can confirm actual product sales mix? Appliances? Big construction? Professional contractor sales?

More people buying paint and mulch doesn’t mean more $$$.

This Friday the victims of the wildfire will vote Yes or no for the settlement agreement.

As veritas said, 98% of victims thus far that have casted votes are in favor of the settlement, and even if it will take until June 30 to exit bankruptcy, there are a lot of near term catalysts that will give PCG plenty of upwards momentum and spike IV.  In addition to the vote this Friday, on May 21, we have CPUC approval vote for bankruptcy plan and then on May 27 we have final confirmation where judge will approve and PCG will take off. That’s why hedge funds have loaded up on OTM september 20 strike calls. However, the near term momentum that the positive vote will provide will also make sure that we see a rally in PCG’s stock through the end of may. Analysts have given upwards revisions to price targets already despite the chance that the vote may not be a done deal, so as votes start to go in favor of exiting bankruptcy, analysts will continue to raise their price targets. 

So buy May 29 calls to take advantage of all the votes this month, and the reason I say 14.5, is because if you look at February, PCG was at $18 in anticipation for exiting bankruptcy.  Now that we are practically there, why shouldn't we be at least at $18?  Also buy September calls at 19 because there is massive OI for September due to hedge funds seeing the great value in PCG.  Best part is you can sell when IV spikes and make huge profit!  Right now they are super cheap, so take advantage of it now before the bus leaves.

TLDR: buy pcg calls for end of May (14, 14.5, 15 5/29) and September (18, 19, 20 9/18) because they will print BIG

Edit: the reason the stock price went down a few days ago was because of a WSJ article that questioned the motivations behind Watts the lawyer.  However, there was a previous issue brought forth before and the judge dismissed it immediately because it was grasping at straws.  The people will vote yes for it, because they will get nothing if they don't and they know it.

There is a section titled *Controversies*, with a subsection titled [Admission of Market Manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer#Admission_of_market_manipulation):

>*In a December 2006 interview, Cramer described activities used by hedge fund managers to manipulate stock prices—some of debatable legality and others illegal. He described how he could push stocks higher or lower with as little as $5 million in capital when he was running his hedge fund. Cramer said, ""A lot of times when I was* [*short*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)) *at my hedge fund ... When I was positioned short—meaning I needed it down—I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the* [*futures*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract)*."" He also encouraged hedge funds to engage in this type of activity because it is ""a very quick way to make money.""*[*\[33\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer#cite_note-33)  
>  
>*Cramer stated that everything he did was legal, but that illegal activity is common in the hedge fund industry as well. He also stated that some hedge fund managers spread false rumors to drive a stock down: ""What's important when you are in that hedge-fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction.""*[*\[34\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer#cite_note-34) *Cramer described a variety of tactics that hedge fund managers use to affect a stock's price. Cramer said that one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread false rumors to reporters he described as ""the Pisanis of the world,"" in reference to CNBC correspondent* [*Bob Pisani*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Pisani)*, who Cramer insinuated was able to be manipulated, saying ""You have to use these guys."" He also discussed giving information to ""the bozo reporter from* [*The Wall Street Journal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal)*"" to get an article published.*[*\[35\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer#cite_note-35)[*\[36\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer#cite_note-36) *Cramer said this practice, although illegal, is easy to do ""because the* [*SEC*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission) *doesn't understand it.""*[*\[37\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer#cite_note-37) *During the interview Cramer referred to himself as a ""banking-class hero.""*[*\[38\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer#cite_note-drawsfire-38)

If we compare 5 companies active in the sector (RVLV, CHWY, OSTK, W, FTCH) on fundamentals, here is what we get [Spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/L9YI6ht)

1. RVLV has a very low float. It also has a short ratio of 41%, making it a prime candidate for a squeeze.
2. RVLV has a Current Ratio of nearly 2, and no LT debts.
3. RVLV has a D/E Ratio of 0.78, and as we've seen all their debts are covered by ST Assets (64% covered by cash).
4. They have the best gross margin of the 5 companies.
5. They are profitable
6. They are CF positive from their operations
7. NWC / Share accounts for 43% of the share price.

Whether it's hydroxchloroquine or the remdesi-desi-vir(as trump calls it), treatments have show promise only to find they have serious side effects negating any positive effects. Honestly from a science perspective a lot of it has been bullshit ""pump"" for the laymen that doesn't know better. I just have a bachelors in bio, but it's easy enough to see through.

There is however one promising treatment / mitigation that is out right now, and FDA approved and if you are under 50, you've likely already had it.

The MMR vaccine.

Most of the evidence is correlation right now but there is some solid science behind it.

The science:

1. Basically the rubella virus has about 29% similarity to covid-19. Basically you look at the genetic sequence and compare them which is easy enough to do.
2. Rates of hospitalization and death are strikingly higher in 55 years or older people
3. MMR vaccine has very low side effects, autism study was faked by a lawyer in Britain with a financial interest that has since been disbarred.

The theory:

Essentially it boils down to that the antibodies your body develops against rubella help you fight the coronavirus, so while you will get infected, you end up with a milder form of the disease.

&#x200B;

1. If you are under 55, you've likely had the MMR two dose vaccination
2. US military gets two dose MMR vaccines regardless if they've already had it or not (and that battleship that was in news that got infected showed a super low hospitalization to infection rate). Granted military is a sample of younger and healthier people, but still.
3. Kids have very less severe reactions to coronavirus and the antibody titer for rubella can decline with time, see a random study I googled in the last 5 minutes. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255950/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255950/)
4. Studies of rubella immunity shows higher immunity to rubella after recovery from severe cases of coronavirus: [https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25417/20200422/29-percent-similarity-between-coronavirus-rubella-virus-help-mmr-vaccine.htm?fbclid=IwAR2PVSDqZbO0hRY0fHONGAuvUwUTjqpIGPAOWKxZiACdkfpbbDW1t3QAk08](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25417/20200422/29-percent-similarity-between-coronavirus-rubella-virus-help-mmr-vaccine.htm?fbclid=IwAR2PVSDqZbO0hRY0fHONGAuvUwUTjqpIGPAOWKxZiACdkfpbbDW1t3QAk08)

""In an attempt to justify their theory, the team studied blood  samples from coronavirus patients in England and studied signs of  rubella immunity in moderately and severely ill patients. Their approach  proved to be accurate when they saw higher levels of immunity among  patients with severe cases of the disease after they had recovered.""

5. Studies are currently ongoing to match whether the rubella titer (aka how much antibodies you have in your blood against rubella) compare against coronavirus disease severity

See [https://world.org/MMR-Titers](https://world.org/MMR-Titers)

Study here:

[https://world.org/covid-19](https://world.org/covid-19)

Results from the study are out in a few weeks.

Basically if this proves out, then it might be possible to get booster shots of a known safe vaccine and let the virus rip through the population without mitigation measures.

So with that information in mind,

What stocks do you see benefiting most from this? The tricky bit is that few weeks timeline will likely hit the same timeframe as when US states that opened too early will need to shut down.

This is a RISK and this is not actual ""research""  If you want to be safe buy calls for months ahead not for their earnings.

**$Zuo**, is a company in which COVID magnified. We've all seen how cloud companies are skyrocketing because many businesses are using them for integration etc. Think of it like shopify, except Zuora is only a year old company and shopify went up over 120% since march... Zuo only up 50%. THIS IS A YEAR OLD COMPANY SO LOTS OF POTENTIAL. It's competettiors are like shopify and shit I think.

&#x200B;

>Zuora is an enterprise software company that creates and provides software for businesses to launch and manage their subscription-based services. Zuora’s applications are designed to automate recurring billing, collections, quoting, revenue recognition, and subscription metrics.

&#x200B;

These are the applications that $Zuo offers,

This company has earnings that will be reported on June 3rd and its current trading price is 12$ This company is also only a year old with it being well below its all time high which is $33.88.

I'm not going to give you my FULL research on this because I know nobody will read it and or care so I will just give one very interesting thing that I thought about. I thought about was what companies use ZUO? Now I found many companies that use it but the one that stood out was ZOOM. I went to their payments page and looked at their source code to confirm,

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xmidkpxyxgy41.png?width=352&format=png&auto=webp&s=76da19079225de9903db575ec2697e5bb79b8bdb

Now, if we look at Zooms pricing plans, they offer many different packages

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kfvnph22ygy41.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3b2566136591d2bfcdb613af5935f1debc29780

Not only this but also many 'add ons'

All of these packages/add ons look very reasonable for big companies and schools to buy because of their utilities.  Now looking at Zoom's financials, their buisness model is based on subscriptions.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qngrl9hdygy41.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=26e07a319cf244d4300bd70bf67f6975e6ec8e61

So with the populaurity of zoom and seeing how much it went up Im assuming this only benefits $Zuo

&#x200B;

The more interesting part is that ZOOM will report earnings a few days before ZUO which is very good because im expecting huge growth from zoom which in part will make ZUO skyrocket. Keep in mind ZUO has MANY companies that use it im just using Zoom as an example.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now for Zuora, I looked at their transcript from their last earnings call (March 13th)  guidance was reported as,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vqfs5xue1hy41.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bd339b88cd82d27d918f5eea9f6ba268b27d419

Now from what i'm thinking, this will lead investors to estimate a bigger loss than usual for $Zuo, I think that this earnings call , happening in early march was a blessing because coronavirus impact was just starting to really ramp up and they didn't see the positive effects yet. Using this based off other stocks such as ZOOM who went up over 60% since March 13th. Keep in mind SHOPIFY, the competitor went up over 120% since march..

&#x200B;

Futhermore, Zuo appointed a chief revenue officer who has a good track record.

I would add more but I'm sure nobody read all of this so I will just stop now. Theres much more I can add but I advise you all to do your own research since im a idiot.  I have a really good feeling about $ZUO... but DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. I did not look at their financials from past quarters etc as I don't think the market gives a fuck and only cares about the past few months.

The Fed has been extremely aggressive with monetary policy since the beginning of any signs of instability in the stock market.

With the country on lockdown combined with unemployment spending is going to be at all time lows, which increases deflation.

Other countries’ fiscal policy is going to blow up their currency with stimulus and QE, which in turn will cause USD to be stronger, which increases deflation. I’m not saying we aren’t also doing the same thing with our currency, but the difference is that the USD is the sovereign dollar and we can afford to print. Everyone will want in when the euro collapses, relatively speaking. Think of it like this, you have a bunch of factories that produce metals (all the countries doing stimulus). 99 out of 100 of the factories produces unlimited silver, the last factory produces unlimited gold. Do you want to take your silver and purchase gold while you still can? Then use that gold as leverage to do international trade down the road.

The Fed has already started printing their way out of this mess, and they will need to continue printing to fight deflation. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, the strong USD will actually allow them to print while maintaining inflation at reasonable levels.

TLDR; 

Economic shutdown + unemployment causes money flow to slowdown = deflation.

Other countries (euro, China) printing money with their own stimulus = de-values their own currency and causes higher demand for USD. Strong dollar = deflation.

Fed = printing money to avoid complete economic collapse.

Fed = printing to fight the deflation.

Fed will continue to print because the strong USD will allow them to do so without absolutely wrecking the economy. 

I can see another stimulus bill being pushed forward in the next month as well as one more toward end of the summer/fall.",2020-05-15 05:04:13,-0.9257,0.0,-0.4927499999999999,-0.47281666666666666

Iovance is a pharmaceutical company that focuses on a new technology to fight cancer. This technology is called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILS). Essentially how this works is when you have a tumor your body generates lymphocytes, these lymphocytes fuck up the cancer cells causing the tumor. 

Only issue is cancer fucks up your immune system so it prevents the generation of these cells

So what this company is doing is taking the lymphocytes out from the tumor, having them multiply to billions and then injecting the shit right back inside where the tumor is chilling at.

Sounds simple, but it has had great results. In previous studies they’ve had over 24% patients out of 93 that had a total elimination of the tumor after treatment. And 56% having a reduction in tumor size. 

This is one of the only companies specializing and dedicating their whole company to these types of treatments, they are the inevitable future of cancer research.

They’re releasing results for this via live stream at the ASCO convention. 

Literally can’t go tits up.

&nbsp;

*Leans in, whispers*  

Let me tell you why the stock market keeps going up like clockwork every day in the face of horrific economic news. This is the reason why stonks will keep going up until something big breaks.     


&nbsp;
  
This might be the longest read you've ever seen on Wall Street Bets. Like I give a fuck. Just tell me where I'm wrong.  


&nbsp;

The most important 4 things you need to understand about your shitty out-of-the-money 5/22 SPY Puts are:

**Passive ETFs now dominate the stock market.** 
Passive ETFs drive everything. They drive market direction, they drive pricing. The sheer volume and size of Passive ETFs now determines market direction.  

**Passive ETFs care about flow. Passive ETFs do not care about the traditional market role of price discovery.** 
If money comes in the door, Passive ETFs have a mandate to buy stocks or bonds, no matter what. No one at Vanguard is investing based on a return on investment calculation. Passive ETFs don't give a shit about price. Is MSFT trading at $1M/share and generating $1 cash per year in profits? Is it part of the S&P 500 index which your passive ETF tracks? The ETF buys MSFT. Will it be 100 years before TSLA pays back any cash flow to investors? Who gives a shit. It is in the index. Durrr buy. This is a problem that no one is thinking about. For those lucky few of you who ever held a job, think back to any projects your company had you doing. Did they throw money at you without thinking or were they hoping for *a return on the cash they invested*? You probably had a hurdle rate or something similar, a goal to earn 10% or more above the initial investment cost. Example: If you buy an ice cream truck for autists for $100, maybe you hope to sell $10 worth of ice cream every month, paying off your investment in 10 months and generating profits after that. Passive ETFs DGAF about returns. When money flows from your paycheck to them, they buy.  

**Passive ETFs impact prices for everyone in the market, including themselves.** 
Many money managers do not grasp this fact yet because they'd rather ignore the issue entirely. It's embarrassing for money managers to get their asses kicked by literally the dumbest Buy/Sell algorithm ever. The academics have been almost completely silent on this point, but the Sharpe ratio which drove a lot of the original Passive ETF construction is absolutely volatile shit. This will end in tears.   

**Passive ETF flows are driven by 401k contributions. Job goes away = $ flow goes away.**  

Watch this presentation and refute literally any part of it and I will eat a cockroach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-rJciYZmi0  

&nbsp;

OK you say, so all of this depends on flows, and therefore stocks go up when money comes in. But white collar layoffs which are just starting to... oh shit.     


&nbsp;


Yes. You get it now.    


&nbsp;
These are also problems:  
**Corporations have paused buybacks to conserve cash.**
**Our largest, most wealthy generation is now frantically rotating from stocks to bonds.** Yields are low, but do you think they're buying stocks right now? Fuck no. Boomers are rotating to bonds. Because bonds are ""safe"". Here's the data: https://ici.org/research/stats/flows/combined/combined_flows_05_13_20  

So Joe the Plumber is selling all of his shitty, actively managed mutual funds and shifting into DUM DUM DUM passive bond ETFs. Surely, at a time of record corporate debt to equity ratios, nothing can go wrong there. Oh yeah, and record amounts of the bonds in question are ""covenant lite"" which means Joe is giving money to companies with no strings attached. Sounds a lot like equity doesn't it? https://wtvbam.com/news/articles/2020/apr/30/the-devils-in-the-detail-for-junk-debt-investors-facing-coronavirus-defaults/1012738/   


&nbsp;

But it gets more complex.   


&nbsp;

**Boomer Bailout 2 Gonna Boom**
Boomer Bailout 2 has been a truly epic extraction of trillions of wealth from Gen X and Gen Z to prop up the bond markets in the U.S. What did the Fed roll out first? Trillions for bond ETFs, for Boomer Bailout 2. Small business support can *cough* come later on. Hand-waving, vague promises. JWow.   


&nbsp;

Pop Quiz 1: When a company issues more bonds, but profits stay level or decline who gets fucked? The equity holders. Now do that, but at a nation-state level.   

Pop Quiz 2: Who is increasing their equity holdings in the US? Gen Z and Gen X on autopilot 401ks, who have been trained to BTFD from the last bailout.  


&nbsp;

**Governments All Over the World Are Printing to Prop Up Local Markets**
The Japanese Government has been buying Japanese stocks for *years now*. The ECB is a similar story but with bonds. Smart companies issue debt in Europe when they can. See LVMH's deal to acquire TIF: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-07/louis-vuitton-gets-help-from-the-ecb-for-16-billion-tiffany-deal  


&nbsp;

China has truly epic amounts of off-book debts, estimated to be more than 3x GDP. All of this matters because it shows that there is a bigger game afoot. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-debt/chinas-debt-tops-300-of-gdp-now-15-of-global-total-iif-idUSKCN1UD0KD  


&nbsp;

No country wants to take the pain associated with a real multi-year depression. So, every major country is printing and propping up their market.    

Side Note: Watch China's foreign currency reserves shrink in the coming months. It's gonna get spicy. Something like 30-40% of Chinese GDP is trade dependent... and they've pissed everyone off. Trade war 'bout to get real.


&nbsp;  

Why am I telling you all of this? Because I have no clue when things turn south again, but there probably has to be some kind of tipping point:  


&nbsp;

*Boomer rotation from stocks to bonds accelerates    
*Shit-ton of white collar layoffs 
*The Euro or the Yuan breaks hard  
*Massive corporate debt defaults  


&nbsp;

A true autist can't discount Fed support. The Fed could outright buy American stocks just to ensure we aren't the first country to fall. So straight up Puts are a no-go at today's prices. Even without the Fed solely propping up debt-loaded shitcos, the market could rip up OR down on Passive ETF volume.   


&nbsp;

At some point, when people really seriously want their money back TODAY, and not 30 years from now, the market pain will be real. Until then, the ponzi goes on.  


&nbsp;

What does a Passive ETF market structure encourage:  
*Fraud  
*Destruction/Misallocation of Capital (equity hodlers)  
*High and Indiscriminate Debt Loads  
*High Paper Marks for PE and VC's Taking Companies Public  
*Volatility with a capital V, down or up    


&nbsp;

Darth John Bogle created a simple-minded monster that is going to fuck up your 401k. It was designed to follow active managers around the market, drafting off their returns. It was not designed to sit behind the wheel and drive the market. It only knows how to press the accelerator. Central banks are pumping jet fuel into the gas tank. Buckle up.    


&nbsp;

Now that I've told you about the Passive ETF Ponzi Scheme, just promise me one thing:   

&nbsp;

Being only moderately autistic I need a fucking Rainman to tell me first if they can figure out when the market will break.

Edit:  Tl;dr - “To receive shares through that process, warrant holders will have to ""surrender"" a number of warrants based on an equation...”

(Numbers in example are hypothetical)

X = (number of warrants * (FMV - Exercise price)

(1,000*($17.50 - $11.50) = $6,000

Y = FMV or $17.50

 
Number received shares warrants --> $6,000 / $17.50 = 343

Number of surrender warrants -> 1,000 - 343 = 657

If we look at the prices into the close:
 
1,000 warrants would cost $8.08 each, so $8,080

So demand has been reduced dramatically around the world, our $21 trillion GDP has basically been paused for 2 months, so to keep it afloat (rough math), the government had to add $3.5 trillion to keep the economy running somewhat smoothly. That's a lot of printing, you idiots probably expect inflation. Wrong, step away from the US and look at what other countries are doing, the ECB (European Central Bank) and BOJ (Bank of Japan) are having to print trillions of dollars worth of EURO and YEN to keep their economies going, along with every other country getting pounded. Not only that, but since the US dollar makes up 70% of global transactions, in liquidity terms, trillions worth of  euro and yen is MUCH MUCH more than any amount Jpow feels like printing, there's no way our printing could offset what the rest of the world is doing, so inflation isn't coming. If you want proof, just look at the euro/usd (going lower) and literally ANY emerging market currency is getting absolutely clapped vs the dollar.

&#x200B;

Furthermore, not only is US corporate debt at an all time high, but emerging markets, the eurozone, and asia has borrowed more dollars than ever before at any point in history, basically everyone around the world's debt is denominated in US DOLLARS. So what's about to happen? It's already happening, demand for US dollars is going up because everyone around the world wants to borrow more to offset cash flow concerns and pay off existing debts, which will cause the dollar to increase in value. What happens when the whole world has debt in dollars and the dollar goes up in value? DEBT BECOMES MORE EXPENSIVE. This is DEFLATION, and in particular and even more terrifying DEBT DEFLATION, a phrase that would make Jpow absolutely shit himself (and he knows its coming). This has already started before the whole beervirus nonsense, look at Venezuela and Zimbabwe, they had too much dollar debt, no one wanted to lend to them anymore and whoops, their currency is worthless now. It's going to be like a game of musical chairs for people trying to get access to dollars, starting with emerging markets and eventually moving into the more developed economies. The result: massive corporate bankruptcies, countries defaulting on debt (devaluing their currencies) and eventually a deleveraging of massive proportions. This WILL occur and no amount of printing can stop it, it's already too far gone.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter what the stock market does, other markets around the world will be fucked, honestly it might cause the market to go up because of all the money fleeing other countries trying to find a safe place to live. Here are the plays assholes. TLT will go up because no matter what Jpow says, he doesn't control the fed funds rate, the market does, and US treasury bond yields have already priced in bonds going negative. CPI shows that we may see up to -3% inflation (3% deflation), meaning at .25% fed funds rate, the REAL rate is 3.25%, that is the worst thing possible during a deleveraging because it makes it harder to stimulate the economy, the fed has no choice, rates MUST go lower. Rates go lower, bond prices go up, TLT 12/18 $205c. Remember how I said scared foreign money will want to find a nice safe place to go when we go into the biggest debt crisis the world has seen in over 300 years? GLD 12/18 $240c. Finally, the dollar will rise in value as well so UUP 12/18 $28c.

&#x200B;

As far the actual market, we hit a high of SPY 339.08 in February, fell to a low of 218.26 by mid March, and have since then retraced EXACTLY to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at 290, and started to bounce lower from there. I'm no technical analyst, but I do know history. During the greatest crashes in stock market history, 1929, 2001, 2008, the Nikkei in 1989 (Japan) this exact same thing happened, market got scared and fell to lows, then smoked that good hopium for a few weeks or month to retrace between 50% and 61.8% back to previews highs, then absolutely fell off a cliff. If you don't believe me, go look at the charts. Now, I'm personally not going to be betting on the US market falling because of the fact that its just straight up not reflecting reality and there are much better ways to trade on what's occurring (see trades above), but I PROMISE, that we will not be seeing new highs at any point any time soon.

&#x200B;

TLDR; The world is going to shit due to the dollars over-dominance of the world market, we will soon see the worst deleveraging in human history, and may very well have to come up with a new fiat money system (probably not bitcoin, but it wouldn't hurt to have some). TLT 12/18 $205c, GLD 12/18 $240c, and UUP 12/18 $28c. If you wanna be an autist and buy weeklys, I can't help you, but I basically just gave you the next big short, so you're welcome.

Well look no further than Wells Fargo the perennial loser about financials.   The financials , represented by XLF, are not beloved right now as they are being slammed by lower interest rates and also stricter loan requirements in everything from home loans to autos.  

It is one of the weakest among the primary dealers - exceeded only by Deustcheland Bank whose woes are a topic for another discussion- so if you include only American banks then it is #1 on the list.  

The stock has been under pressure due to dividend cut fears.  The concerns about a dividend cut has hit Wells Fargo particularly hard because it has one of the highest payout ratios among banks making it beloved by Boomers and fund managers.  Wells Fargo's current annual dividend rate of $2.08 a share implies a dividend yield of 8.48%. That compares with the yield for the financial XLF of 2.87% and the implied yield for the S&P 500 index of 2.05%, according to FactSet.   This is not sustainable.    If capital is an issue (which it is at any business) then it makes sense to save it instead of spending it on investors.

WFC has also been up today on rumors that GS will buy them out.  Unfortunately for WFC bulls I find that unlikely b/c market cap deposit restrictions imposed by the FDIC.   Here is an analyst's words on it:  

 *02:38 PM EDT, 05/14/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Speculation that Wells Fargo (WFC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) may merge sent shares of Wells Fargo up 6.5% in afternoon trading, however, the speculation is a ""non-starter,"" according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) analyst Vivek Juneja, Business Insider reported.*     

*Business Insider reported that in a note on Thursday, Juneja said that the combined deposit market share of the two banks would go past the regulatory limit. In a separate report, MarketWatch said Juneja reiterated his underweight rating on the stock and said a takeover by a bank of Wells Fargo would be ""banned by law.""*     

&#x200B;

Now, WFC has bounced back today in intra-day trading ( so far to around 8.5-9%). The stock had plunged 24.9% during a 10-day stretch in which it fell nine times, to close Wednesday at the lowest price since June 2009.

Stock jumped in mid march pricing in the panic buying then followed the market down.  The lockdown has lasted much, much longer than anyone expected and most people/families have been eating three square meals a day at home (not to mention stress eating).  Price peaked in March at $34.19 and just started revisiting that level yesterday but I don’t believe that two and a half months of every person in America grocery shopping for themselves and their families for every meal has been close to priced in.

Despite the economy re-opening, restaurants are taking much longer and in many cases only doing take out/pick up.  If they are open, they are at limited capacity.  The hospitality industry is expecting reduced sales through Q1 of next year.  Again, this means eating at home and a sustained bump in sales.

KR has spent the last 6 years making big moves to automated factories and bolstering online ordering.  Obviously this was in response to Amazon/whole foods but it also means that KR was ready to fully capitalize on the conditions presented by the shutdown.

Also, They just gave their CEO a fucking raise.  During the middle of a fucking pandemic.   19% with a $2.7mil bonus (7.5x last year’s cash award).  Wonder what drove that conversation?

Bad news is good news for Kroger.  2nd wave? Hotspots? All good for Kroger.

There are macro trends at play here that may or may not affect sales long term:  unemployment, and a shift away from going out as well as a people genuinely enjoying cooking for themselves.

$BILI is a Chinese media company that operates the Bilibili video-sharing platform and produces mobile games for a Chinese audience. They specifically focus on catering to Gen Z kids in China who play those ""officially licensed"" mobile games that are pay-to-win, and Bilibili the platform is primarily centered on gaming and animations, though it has expanded recently to include more areas of interest. Think of it as Chinese Youtube, if Youtube wasn't the monopoly it is and instead was just the biggest fish in the pond. Like Youtube, they also have a live-streaming component that allows people to donate to streamers, while Bilibili takes a cut.

I dumbed it down for you morons but you should get what this means. Same logic behind why gaming companies boosted; people are spending more time on their phones playing games and consuming content. That means more ads are being seen, more in-game purchases are being made, more people have more time to simp for e-girls and pay for other degenerates to play videogames they're too lazy to play.

Now I know what you're thinking. $LK. Some of you dolts got burned when that coffee cup fell over in your lap, and now you think every Chinese company that moons is a test of how well you can edge. Well if this was another Luckin' Coffee, would Sony invest hella money? No! So shut the fuck up! Cause that's exactly that they did, Sony bought a stake of $BILI worth $400 M. That's no small-cock move considering that BILI's market cap is just above $10 B. And they print too. BILI has consistently posted annual revenue growth, with FY 2019 ending with revenue just under $1 B. In the last quarter alone, BILI had almost $300 M in revenue, one of their most successful quarters yet. Furthermore, as revealed on the 2019 SEC filing, BILI has made continuous efforts to diversify their business and this effort has clearly paid off considering the rapid growth in BILI's other sectors.

But wait, there's more! This week, BILI reached an ATH of 31.17, and that's only two weeks after the COVID-19 crash in March brought it to a low of $25. Since it's IPO at $9.80 in 2018, BILI has gone up 212% and looks intent on keeping that momentum up even despite 'rona bringing the markets down. Even since January of 2020, BILI has gained $8 to hit $30 per share, and a positive earnings for this quarter could easily send it up further. Point being, my fellow addicts, there's a green dragon on the side of the next moon launch.

Unfortunately BILI only has monthlies, so option action is limited BUT there should be a run up to earnings. I'm bullish on BILI's future in the long term since I think they are well placed to corner the Chinese video-sharing market, so even taking long calls on $BILI may be desirable.T hey report AH on Monday 5/18. I've got my 6/19 40c and my tickets to tendie heaven, and there's plenty of room on this rocket.

TL;DR: $BILI 6/19 calls. Personally I have 40c. $BILI's stake in online media in China, thanks to COVID, should see a nice increase. They're damn solid and look like they've got room to grow

Here's my thinking:

Traditionally GPRE has made ethanol for the fuel market, which has been getting slammed as drivers pare back their commutes and shopping trips. But recently the company has pivoted toward servicing the hand sanitizer market. In a web conference put on by BMO yesterday, GPRE CEO Todd Becker said:

*“We are selling \[hand sanitizer grade alcohol\] as well, and one thing we announced is our sales and our special relationship with Xerox who is making hospital grade hand sanitizer to go into their communities.”*

*“We’re talking to major consumers across, consumer companies across the branded \[hand sanitizer\] space, that are all in, that all need alcohol, even the type of alcohol we make.”*

The stock has been destroyed amid fears about lower sales due to driving demand but Q2 hand sanitizer alcohol sales may not be known until earnings are released. 

Q2 earnings are scheduled to be released on August 3rd, so very short term options may not be the way to play this, but the 9/18 $7.00 calls appear popular with OI over 4,000, even more than June 19th $7.00 call OI at 3,175. 

Thoughts? One concern is whether the hand sanitizer volume offsets the lost volume from fuel demand.

TL;DR: If covid-19 persists, GPRE can continue servicing the hand sanitizer market. If covid-19 is cured, GPRE could ramp up ethanol sales for fuel again. Sep 18 calls will expire after Q2 earnings are released.",2020-05-14 22:55:30,-0.9996,-0.5632,0.5724533333333334,-0.3301155555555556

I was looking at technology companies that have a potentially long runway up - ideally those well-suited to take advantage of COVID while not being overly exposed to potential recession conditions. I found that Smartsheets is reporting earnings June 3rd, and their stock has not increased to the level we've seen other tech companies rise in the past few weeks (read: not priced in). Their Q1 earnings report also includes April, so the influx of people using Smartsheets due to COVID will show up on earnings and growth.

Their fundamentals are solid - they're still a growth stock, but they have a lot of runway. They've also been doing the ""growth"" part incredibly well, with 90% of the S&P500 as paying customers. If you look at the options volume for June 19th, calls vastly outweigh puts by *90%*, suggesting some early birds are seeing potential here (or insiders!).

# SLACK (WORK)

Bottom Line upfront: As Q1 earnings season winds down there are still a few gems left to mine. Enter WORK. You've probably heard of Slack. Their earnings will be on June 4th. I believe the hype around this stock will cause it to Moon before earnings and with further research, possibly after as well. Like many other tech meme stonks, they run before earnings and there is still time to take advantage of that run up with a few weeks of lead, while the greeks are still in our favor and premiums are relatively low. I compare Slack to Twilio and Teams and find that while it has lower revenue than Twilio, it stands to grow a lot just the same through the crisis and possible change in work environments to follow.

**Many Words:**

Slack has become a household name (read: Meme) in the WFH world and is becoming the ""bandaid"" brand of the work communications the same way ZM is. Both it and Microsoft Teams are basically priced nearly the same for equivalent tiers of service but teams has had a slower marketing start than WORK. Slack has also beaten earnings since IPO and should expect to see an even higher earnings expectation with the rise in WFH.

**Trends and Comparing to Twilio and Teams:** Slack peaked at its IPO and stayed above teams throughout since and saw another spike that coincided with teams when the market was nearing the recent bottom. I also note that compared to TWLO which absolutely soared after earnings, it has always maintained a much greater position in the minds of workers. Slack has become something of a mainstay for many of my friends with real jobs and even more so since the pandemic hit. A quick check of Twitter's interest in the three companies shows a commanding lead by Slack with more than double the number of followers than Teams and six times as many as Twilio.

Since its bottom in March, the share price has steadily increased and in the past 2 weeks is seeing faster if still volatile growth and is hitting its ATH since the initial IPO sell-off WORK experienced.

**Earnings, EPS, and Post Earnings Price Changes:** Slack has seen decent growth in earnings and ops expenses (its growing) since IPO and is expected to continue this trend if not move pretty well upward in a COVID-19 world.  Slack has 425mm shares outstanding vs TWLO's 128. Slack is clearly spending more on ops expenses which eats into their net income and EPS but does indicate they have more developers working for them. I wasn't able to compare anything to Microsoft Teams since their Q3 report did not seem to break out their earnings from each product. On a per-share basis, Slack has 3.32x more shares outstanding than TWLO. If you gave TWLO as many shares outstanding, its pre-earnings moon price would have been 24ish per share. As of today, WORK is knocking the door on 32. If they see the same solid earnings that TWLO experienced, a similar such jump, and this is HIGHLY speculative, would land us at 57/share for WORK. That said, other tech stocks have seen very mixed responses post-earnings where we have seen companies like Cloudflare (NET), NFLX, PTON, etc who ran on pre-earnings and dumped the trading session after but did recovery, while companies like TWLO, CHGG, FSLY, etc did great post-earnings disclosure while still others, looking at you, LOGI, who moved up a little but have been flat since. I'm not sure its fair to put LOGI in the same boat because its a large, long-standing tech-hardware company and we are looking at much smaller cap software/services tech companies.

Current EPS consensus is -.06 with a range of -.04 to -.07. Their historic EPS has trended upwards but has always been in the negative single cent range.

**COVID-19 and You:** Slack went down recently for a little while which was the subject of some bad press because it is so depended upon for remote teams. It turns out, however, that servers went down because there was a server-side issue when they were ADDING even more servers due to increased demand for their service.  [https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus-2020-05-13/card/m5UO9yuLxsx1czUHVXpt](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus-2020-05-13/card/m5UO9yuLxsx1czUHVXpt). This bodes well for how this Q will look and with EPS expectations basically flat from prior quarters, we may well be looking at a solid EPS beat this go around.

**Voodoo BS TA**: Bottom side resistance is strong at 30 and continues to see a higher peak. I don't believe in TA but the trend is the trend. Interest in the last month has increased the price by almost 25% already.

TL;DR / Don't sleep on Slack and capture the run-up to earnings AH on 4 June, sell before close or be brave, and hope for a TWLO-style moonshot when they do well. Their service is seeing a significant increase in demand since lockdowns began.

Sell a call to the dimwitted call buyers. Collect dividend(s). Buy to close after the call value tanks when ex-dividend price drops. Is this EZ gainz or BIG RETARD?

Consider EURN. They're trading at $9.64 right now. In two weeks, they'll pay a $1.16 dividend.

Now you can sell a call on them.

&#x200B;

|Strike, August call|Last price|
|:-|:-|
|5.00|4.80, extrinsic = 0.16|
|7.50|2.55, extrinsic = 0.41|
|10.00|0.90|
|12.50|0.50|

&#x200B;

The simple way to do this would be to sell the OTM call at 12.50. Then you pick up the dividend and the premium of an option that will likely expire worthless. And if it doesn't expire worthless you get a 25% gain on the stock for a 30-40% total gain depending on if the price shoots up before or after the dividend.

The trickier strategy is to sell the ITM calls. By put-call parity, you're selling a synthetic put on the underlying to insure the purchaser. Selling the ITM calls let's you collect the intrinsic value of the call which would let you get 25-50% leverage on the dividends plus win due to an immediate drop in the intrinsic value of the option following the ex-dividend date. Assuming your counterparty is not retarded, the risk here is that either they exercise before the dividend or that you can't fill the order with enough extrinsic value to discourage early exercise.

Both strategies share the risk that the underlying price plummets and you take a loss on the stock, but I think that's unlikely when tankers are already trading so far below their NAV.

This strategy seems like an easy way to get 5%+ gains in a month while holding a stock with a lot of upside potential. Not much, but honest and safe profits.

Foreward

This summary of Ray Dalio’s “Template for Understanding Big Debt Crises” was copy-pasta'd from my FB notes on 5/11/2020. It focuses on the events between 1928-1937, which includes the events leading up the US Great Depression and after, and is contrasted to the events leading up to and happening now. I chose this particular time period as Ray Dalio has explicitly stated in [modern interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrxYhv2O3wU) that we are entering a New World which resembles the era in which that last one occurred. After reading his amazing book “Principles” and seeing how he is pretty much the Steve Jobs of economics, I wanted to learn more about his thoughts and opinions about the effects of the Corona Virus on the economy.

1927-1929: The Bubble || \[***\*2017-2019\****\]

[The charts above show the explosion in margin debt through the bubble between 1927-1930 and the accompanying rise in prices.](https://preview.redd.it/0ac0t06icry41.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=02fe7b7c241e14314f014d6ffaa6f052957bd7ec)

After WWI \[***\*The economic equivalent of our 2008-2009 Financial Crisis\****\] the economy experienced rapid technological growth with radio and automobile growth \[***\*Internet-Of-Things growth\****\] leading the charge. Technological innovations happened across many other sectors as well. Technological breakthroughs filled the newspapers, driving wide-spread optimism about the economy.

Debt growth was approximately in line with income growth because it was being used to finance activities that produce fast income growth.

Then a bubble began to emerge. As is classic, the bubble had its roots in the dizzying productivity and technological gains of the period and people making leveraged bets that they would continue.

New buyers flooded the market, many of them were unsophisticated investors with no prior experience with stocks, one of the classic signs of a bubble. \[***\*Recall that brokerages have been competing for household investors by lowering commission fees since 2012, and now most, if not all, brokerages offer zero dollar commission; such as Robin Hood\****\] Household margin debt was fueling the bubble. \[***\*Recall that the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis bubble was fueled by housing market debt, and the 2020 bubble is being fueled by debt.\****\]

1929 (late): The Top and the Crash || \[***\*2019 - 2020 (early)\****\]

The Federal Reserve started to tighten monetary policy, hoping to slow the growth of speculative credit without crippling the economy, it raised the interest rate to 6%.

[25 year chart of the federal interest rate. You can see the FED tightening at a rate of 0.25&#37; to try and reign in the economic growth starting in 2016.](https://preview.redd.it/oy4u6my3dry41.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0af1d6e2c3532fe1b321365fd9bd90f178d9dc2)

\[***\*Before the Crash of 2020, the Fed was tightening the economy by increments of 0.25% over the course of 4 years starting around 2016. After the Financial Crisis of 2008, rates were held near 0% to stimulate economic growth. The interest rate was 1.75% prior to the Crash of 2020, the only place to go now is negative interest rates, should the Fed decide on that\****\] As loans became more costly and holding cash became more attractive than holding longer duration and/or riskier financial assets (such as bonds, equities, and real estate), money moved out of financial assets causing them to fall in value. Declining asset prices created a negative wealth effect, which fed on itself in the financial markets and fed back into the economy through declining spending and incomes.

The Bubble reversed into a bust. \[***\*February 20, 2020: The top of  2020 crash, only this time slightly different as it was in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and an oil price war between Russia and the OPEC, and the Federal interest rate was only at 1.75% instead of 6%\****\]

The Federal Reserve attempted to counter the collapse in credit by providing liquidity to the markets. The Fed announced it would inject $100M to ease the credit crunch by purchasing government securities. \[***\****[April 16, 2020: Federal Reserve Announces Municipal Liquidity Facility](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/covid-19-update-federal-reserve-announces-municipal-liquidity-facility?fbclid=IwAR1EDGksoce8WfbDcSEFZD0ByGBS2dDXXPBzwVh02VO5sEehZkLROea9i2M) ***(the “MLF”) and Under the MLF, a Federal Reserve Bank will commit to lend funds to a special purpose vehicle (the “SPV”), on a full-recourse basis and secured by all assets of the SPV.  The SPV will also be funded by the Treasury Department, which will make an initial equity investment of $35B to provide the market’s with liquidity\****\]

Stocks snapped back, rising 12.3% in one of those sharp bear market rallies that classically occur repeatedly during the depression phases of big debt cycles. \[***\*We experienced a 21.3% snap back between March 23-26, 2020.***\*\]

By New Year’s Day of 1930 it was widely believed that the stock market’s 50% fall was over, which helped drive a strong rebound over the next four months. \[***\*This is where I believe we are\****\]

Stocks seemed cheap because there wasn’t much evidence that company earnings would fall much \[***\*Recall that companies are not currently offering guidance on earnings for next quarter due to the uncertainty over Corona Virus impact\****\], and investors were biased about their memories of the most recent downturn and subsequent recovery; most assumed that events would play out similarly this time.

In the early stages of deleveraging, it’s very common for investors and policy makers to underestimate how much the real economy will weaken, leading to small rallies that quickly reverse, and initial policy responses that aren’t enough.

\[***\*It is here that history diverges from current events, because what transpires here hasn’t happened for us yet\****\]

The future cyclical events are as follows:

1930-1932: Depression

1933-1936: The Beautiful Deleveraging

1936-1938: The Tightening Causes Recession

1938-1939: The Path to War

A ~35% drop in the market relative to the market high prior to the drop and then a ~30% rise in the market relative to the market low is insane.

I've always said that rapid increases in stock prices (that have no substantial reasoning) is just as scary as a market drop. The saying that stock prices ""rise like taking an elevator up and drops like jumping out of the building"" is accurate. 

However, this time the rise in the market is acting like they gave you a jetpack prior to jumping out of the building. It's speed of recovery is faster than the market correction that happening on December 2018.

I have a few assumptions of why there has been this fast rebound:

1. Investors are worried that they are going to miss the opportunity to buy stocks while they are low, creating a pseudo bull trend.

2. Investor confidence that the pandemic was only temporary (a few month or up to a year) and that we would recover.

3. A lot of possible daytrading going on during the stay-at-home orders, given that the hour before closing bell has seen a lot of sell-offs recently.

There could be other reasons for this that I can't think of off the top of my head, but I personally think we are in the process of seeing a secondary market drop. Investors will realize that the economy isn't as strong it was prior to the pandemic.

\--------------------------------------------------

Everyone is pilling into this merger with the hopes that Nikola will be the next rocket to tendy town like Tesla has been.

What many people forget is that Tesla was stuck between $20 and $30 for 2 years, and that was with an IPO price of $20. Tesla's market cap didn't break 4B until 3 years in.

The deal price for VTIQ and Nikola to merge is $10, and that gives the company a generous valuation at 3.3B.

All current shareholders of VTIQ receive 1 for 1 share in the new merged company. But here is the problem, the new merged company has 402 million shares outstanding, compared to the 29m the VTIQ has now. That doesn't even take into account the warrants that could be exercised, if not recalled, diluting the value further.

**Whats that mean?** The stock price of VTIQ is valuing the merged company at Around 10.5 billion as of this post. 10.5 billion for a company that won't even have a product until 2022 according to their own report. A company that will surely need to issue more debt to fund growth  or even just operations.

Look, if you wanna get into the future of transportation and feel like you missed out on Tesla and think Nikola could be next, I recommend waiting to build your position until after the merger is complete and the meme stock attention has moved on. Nikola may be a great company... in 4 years... but its not going to be the next Tesla between now and then, if ever.

June 2nd is when the vote is scheduled to confirm the merger.  Buying this stock at anything over $15 before the merger is complete, for any reason, is just asking to get crushed when it comes crashing down.

I've screened some options yesterday to find some low premium, low IV options that are highly undervalued at the moment. They are mainly mid-cap tech/finance companies that have promising guidance for the coming weeks, so I've shortlisted a couple 6/19 calls for you. Let me know what you think. 

**Upland Software Inc** (UPLD): 

* Upland is a cloud-based enterprise work management software that was somehow overlooked in the past couple of weeks. Few days ago, the company announced financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2020 with an increase of 40% in revenue from Q1 2019 to Q2 2020. And yet, the stock is currently trading at $27 which is 38% less than its pre-Covid highs of $43, so there is significant room for growth
* Upland's strong Q1 performance and revised guidance demonstrates Upland’s resilience as the company navigates the COVID-19 pandemic. Their products products have helped customers succeed in this new remote working environment
* Upland’s enterprise customer base, high recurring revenue, retention and margins, limited exposure to highly impacted sectors, strong balance sheet, and flexible cost structure positions the company well to emerge from the pandemic
* UPLD play: **35c 6/19 - IV: 65%**

**Virtu Financial** (VIRT): 

* Virtu Financial is a high-frequency trading firm that quotes buy and sell prices for stocks, options and profits on the spread. The heightened volatility in the first quarter led to a spike in trading volume, which has, in turn, generated increased revenue
* Virtu delivered strong earnings and record revenue in the first quarter, another solid report for a stock that's gained about 50% this year
* The number of trades in the market is expected to continue as volatility will remain due to COVID-19 pandemic, and these guys seem to know what they are doing - they are not fully retards like WSB traders
* VIRT play: **25c 6/19 - IV: 39%**

**Inseego** (INSG): 

* Inseego is a small-cap telematics company that designs and develops mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-based services for enterprise customers, service providers and small- and medium-sized businesses. For example, they provide wireless 3G, 4G and 5G hardware products for the federal government's First Responder Network (including COVID-19 first response teams)
* Inseego is seeing strong demand driven by the work from home, distance learning and telehealth trends and this momentum is set to continue. Accelerating sales are expected to help the company swing to profitability in 2021
* Despite beating their Q1 earnings, the company is still trading around $10, which is 30% below their highs from late April ($14) due to the recent dip. There are many low IV, low premium calls available at the moment
* INSG play: **15c 6/19 - IV: 103%**

After thinking about this for a couple days, I think what is going on is that prices are getting bid up in extended hours on retail investors optimism/good news, then during the day smart money is taking profits, driving prices back down.

2742,DD,DDDD - AAL will file Chapter 7 bankruptcy by Q4,184,gji78x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gji78x/dddd_aal_will_file_chapter_7_bankruptcy_by_q4/,151,1589473221.0,"I usually post these once a week, but I had some extra time today and my sleep schedule's fucked so I thought I'd go ahead and write up another DDDD (data-driven DD) about another position that I've been holding for a while - AAL death puts.

Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so; look at what happened to all the SPY 220p 4/17 bag holders.

Everybody knows airlines are fucked. You know it's bad when perma-bull Warren Buffet sells ALL their airline stocks. AAL is especially fucked, and their stock price, down 70% from Feb, reflects this. Even being down so much, Warren Buffet STILL sold. So how much worse can this be? Let's look at their Q1 numbers and forward guidance. [Here's their 10-Q if you want to follow along](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/4515/000000620120000066/q1202010-q033120.htm).

**Q1 Income Statement**

|Revenue|$8.5B|
|:-|:-|
|Op. Expenses|$11B (1.4B fuel, 3.1B salaries, 630M maintenance, others not important)|
|Non-operating Expenses|$341M (257M net interest expense, others not important)|
|Net loss|$2.2B|
|Q1 EPS|\-$5.26|

**Balance Sheet**

|Total Assets|$58B (7.1B current, 34B equipment, 8.6B lease rights, others not important)|
|:-|:-|
|Total Liabilities|$61B (19B current, 22B long term, 6B pensions, others not important)|
|Book Value (Equity)|\-$2.6B|

Ok wait hold up. It has a negative book value? That's already a red flag. In fact it was pretty poorly financially positioned even before COVID-19 with a book value of -$118M in Dec 2019, and this was when things were booming. Their -$5.26 EPS for 1Q annualized to -$21.04 with a current stock price of $9.11 gives them a PE ratio of -0.4. This is with Q1 being strong up until March. Imagine how bad Q2 is going to be. Also, their book value of -$-2.6B and have a market cap of $3.9B. Valuations make absolutely no sense when a company has negative book value, and they should theoretically already be bankrupt by now, but I could tell you that there's no way that this company is worth anywhere close to $3.9B, especially with bleak prospects for airlines in the next few years. This is why Warren Buffet sold all his airlines at a massive loss. Even if they don't go bankrupt (which they probably will soon), they'll be spending all their earnings for the next decade recovering their book value from this quarter alone.

**Liquidity and Debt**

|Total Long Term Debt|24.7B (23.4B secured, 1.3B unsecured)|
|:-|:-|
|Available Revolving Debt (as of March 2020)|3.2B|
|Cash + Marketable Securities|3.6B|
|Max. Loans from U.S. Government Payroll Support Program|5.8B|
|Available Liquidity in Q2|12.6B|

In their 10Q, it was mentioned that they had a cash burn rate of $70M / day. Using that we can predict what their available liquidity would look like at the end of Q2.

End of Q2 Available Liquidity = 12.6B - ($70M \* 92 days) = 6.2B

They also mentioned that they will be trying to reduce their cash burn to $50M / day by June. One of their covenants for long term bonds that they've issued is that they must maintain at least $2B in liquidity, With that rate let's see how long it will take for them to break that.

Days until problems = (6.2B - 2B) / 50M = 84 days

They're literally already deep into insolvency territory. Noone is going to lend them money when they run out of liquidity; they've even talked about this as one of their risk factors in their 10Q. The government already approved a bailout for airlines and it's highly unlikely they're going to get a second bailout. Assuming that air travel isn't going to miraculously recover by September (which everyone with a brain will agree it won't), and they meet their targets for cost reduction despite the requirement that they do not furlough nor reduce salaries until the end of Q3, they will have run out of cash by then. What's next? Let's look at what their Q2 book value would look like.

Book Value = -2.6B (Q1 Book Value) + 5.8B (government bailout loan) - 6.4B (Q2 cash burn) - 3.2B (Revolving debt that they're likely to have drawn down during Q2 and accounted for in cash burn) - 1.7B (government promissory note maturing 2030) = -8.1B

Again their market cap is 3.8B. This is absolutely fucked. Maybe they'll find other ways to delay the inevitable, but their immense amount of cash burn is only going to delay the inevitable by a short while. $AAL is heading to bankruptcy. From the fact that their book value by that time is going to be extremely negative, this will probably be a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which means existing equity holders will get absolutely nothing.

I was just scanning  [https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/big-short-2-hits-all-time-low-commercial-real-estate-implodes](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/big-short-2-hits-all-time-low-commercial-real-estate-implodes)  and looked up CMBS etf

Has the fed just irrationally bought the ETF with absolutely zero interest in what's backing it and any type of price discovery?  Or have people bought it assuming the fed will buy it?  I mean, has it come to this, total moral hazard and a crazy dysfunctional market?

Or is my weak MS Paint skills completely missing the point and there is really not functional correlation between the  **CMBX 6**  and CMBS etf?

I was going to try to figure it out for myself, but it's way beyond my limited IQ and there are some very clueful MBS folks lurking around here..

Guess this is why:   [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities/agency-commercial-mortgage-backed-securities-operations)

Ahh, ""multi family homes.""  So not necessarily malls and offices, but rental properties for voters to live in.  That makes sense now.  Don't want to mess with that.

Plus the ETF looks like a dividend spewing ETF, I'm sure a lot of older folks rely on it to pay their bills.   I can imagine the fed bailing out that early and often.

If you look at the holdings, you see stuff like  FHMS at the top.  FHMS is -  The guaranteed classes are also under FHMS shelf in Bloomberg (Freddie Mac Multifamily Structured Pass-Through K-Certificates)Yeah, multifamily, don't want to short that.  Hope it doesn't implode.
