Point 27: Gimmi those tendies!

So how are we gonna avoid spending little Jimmies college fund? 

First of all we're gonna stop using options. Instead of Calls&Puts use Buys&Sells. You still feel great when you win tendies but instead of loosing 100% on an expiring call you loose 3%, meaning you can make the same mistakes again and again without taking out a third mortgage!

Next? 

That's literally it. All you bulls going GUH as TSLA doesn't stay at $420 would be saving so much $$$ if you just used Buys instead of Calls. Now go inverse whatever I say I'm doing and find out what leverage is for yourself.

DD,War and Geopolitical crises can be Counterintuitive: Buy Calls,39,ejmypd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejmypd/war_and_geopolitical_crises_can_be/,22,1578119518.0,"U.S. airstrikes in Iraq have killed one of Iran's most powerful generals, striking fear into the geopolitical realm. No one knows what exactly this means at the moment, but there is fear of escalating tensions in the Middle East, along with the potential for retaliation and further conflict.

Markets reacted accordingly as [oil and gold prices shot up](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/02/investing/oil-prices-iran-commander-baghdad/index.html) while the [stock market fell](https://www.wsj.com/articles/geopolitical-tensions-put-brakes-on-global-stock-rally-11578038726) and interest rates declined. Market prognosticators have an old rule of thumb that investors hate uncertainty more than anything, and there are few situations more uncertain than the threat of war.

But markets don't always care about rules of thumb, and uncertain situations don't always play out in stocks as many would have you assume. The relationship between geopolitical crises and market outcomes isn't as simple as it seems.

In the six months following the onset of World War I in 1914, the Dow fell more than 30%. Because the war basically ground the business world to a halt and market liquidity all but dried up, the decision was made to close the stock market that year. This lasted for six months, the longest such period on record. Making up for lost time, the Dow rose more than 88% in 1915 after it reopened, which remains the highest annual return on record for the DJIA. In fact, from the start of the war in 1914 until the war ended in late 1918, the Dow was up more than 43% in total or around 8.7% annually.

World War II had a similarly counterintuitive market outcome. Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, setting off the war. When the market opened on September 5, the Dow shot almost 10% higher that day. When the attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor occurred in early December 1941, stocks opened up the following Monday down 2.9%, but it took just a month to regain those losses. When the allied forces invaded France on D-Day on June 6, 1944, the stock market barely noticed. The Dow rose more than 5% over the ensuing month.

From the start of WWII in 1939 until it ended in late 1945, the Dow was up a total of 50%, more than 7% per year.

So, during two of the worst wars in modern history, the U.S. stock market was up a combined 115%.

The Korean War began in the summer of 1950 when North Korea invaded the South. That conflict ended in the summer of 1953. In that time, the Dow was up an annualized 16%, or almost 60% in total.

U.S. troops were sent to Vietnam in March of 1965. The Dow would finish the remainder of that year up almost 10%. By the time the last of the U.S. troops were pulled out of Vietnam in 1973, the stock market was up a total of almost 43% in that time, or just under 5% per year.

The Cuban Missile Crisis had the world on the brink of nuclear war in October of 1962 when the U.S. faced a standoff against Russia. The confrontation lasted 13 days. In that two-week period, the Dow remained surprisingly calm, losing just 1.2%. For the remainder of that year, the Dow would gain more than 10%. Veteran trader Art Cashin [tells the following story](https://ritholtz.com/2017/08/cashin-cuban-missile-crisis-north-korea/) about the advice he received from a seasoned trader during the Cuban Missle Crisis as he was worried about the impact on stocks:

*Jack said – “Look kid, if you hear the missiles are flying, you buy them. You don’t sell them.”*

*“You buy them?” I said, somewhat puzzled.*

*“Sure you buy them!” said Jack. “Cause if you’re wrong, the trade will never clear. We’ll all be dead.”*

The terrorist attack on U.S. soil on Sept. 11, 2001 saw stocks fall sharply, down almost 15% in less than two weeks following the tragedy. The economy was already in the middle of a recession at that point, and stocks were in a free fall from the bursting of the dot-com bubble. But within a couple of months, the stock market had made back all of the losses that occurred in the aftermath of 9/11.

The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003. Stocks rose 2.3% the following day and finished up the year with a gain of more than 30% from that point on. Although it is important to note these gains were coming off the brutal 2000-2002 bear market.

The point here is the market's reaction to war and geopolitical crises can be counterintuitive. It's always difficult to know how investors will react to certain events because so much of the market's reaction to these events is context dependent.

I have no idea what this Iran conflict will mean for the world at large, but even if you knew exactly what the headlines would be in the coming months on this issue, it probably wouldn't help you from an investing perspective. Markets don't always respond to geopolitical events the way you think.

This thing has 60% short interest, I have literally never seen something so likely to go tits up in my life.  On monday I will be opening a position in this stock for after earnings for a couple reasons.  

1.  I exercise a good amount and literally cannot escape Peloton ads.  They are everywhere I go from my gym, around my gym, on pandora all the time, youtube, reddit, literally everywhere.  I have never even googled their products or anything.  At most I may have googled their stock ticker once or twice, but I get tons of ads from supplement places and stuff like that, but Peloton is by far the biggest one.  

Tldr: they are dumping money into advertising, especially for the christmas season

Also, someone on here posted that his Peloton system was down from server overloads, aka, literally too many people are using it and overloading their system.  This means they sold significantly more than they anticipated as well.  

Plus they have a solid business model with selling equipment and subscriptions.

The same company runs another EFT called **$SDS**. This is, you guessed it, the SPY Double $SHort. It's just **$SH with a 2x multiplier**. Unsurprisingly, there are more options available for $SDS than $SH.

But because people suck at pricing options, **$SDS puts are way cheaper than $SPY calls**, and vice-versa. For example, as I'm writing this (2am Eastern on Jan 6 2020):

Jan 10 **SDS PUT** for $24.00 is $0.04. That's 3.10% OTM for **$0.04**.

Jan 10 **SPY CALL** for $327.5 is $0.20. That's 1.55% OTM for **$0.20**.

These two options are equivalent, but the SDS PUT is cheaper. Sure, the bid is currently $0.00, but even at the ask price of $0.08, the **$SDS PUT is less than half the cost of a regular $SPY call**.

This is true for most OTM SPY/SDS option pairs. But when either option goes ITM, **$SDS gains 2x the amount of intrinsic value, since it's a double-short of $SPY**. Exercising the SDS option is better, provided there's volume, and SDS averages 4 million shares/day. That makes up for the lower number of available contracts for SDS, especially since poor autists can't afford that many contracts in the first place.

However, it was dropped due to unwanted side effects from its muscarnic agonist effects (parasympathetic things like vomiting, salivation, diarrhea etc.). But, drugs do exist that are antimuscarinic, but don't cross the blood brain barrier to cause CNS effects (like benadryl makes you drowsy).  You could theoretically combine them together to counteract the side effects. Trospium is one such drug; so, Karuna therapeutics was formed in 2009 to combine xanomeline and trospium as KarXT, and study it in schizophrenia/alzheimer's.

Phase 2 topline results were released in November 2019 and were extremely positive, hitting its primary endpoint. It showed PANSS score at five weeks of treatment was 11.6 point reduction compared to placebo. PANSS is a well validated scoring system to measure reduction of symptoms of psychosis. To compare how effective this is to the best selling atypical antipsychotic that already exists, see the drug Abilify ([https://www.aristadahcp.com/efficacy-pivotal-trial](https://www.aristadahcp.com/efficacy-pivotal-trial)). That drug achieved PANSS reduction of 14.7. So why would psychiatrists potentially pick KarXT over Abilify and similar existing antipsychotics? Because antipsychotics, as dopamine antagonists, have horrible side effects. They can cause disturbing extrapyramidal effects like tardive dyskinesia ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUr8ltXh1Pc&t=32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUr8ltXh1Pc&t=32s)). They can also make you fat, raise your cholesterol. Muscarinic agents like KarXT do not cause any of this and the phase 2 trial further demonstrates:  No evidence of somnolence, extrapyramidal side effects or weight gain compared to placebo.

And finally, of course; the Phase 2 results showed KarXT was very well tolerated as opposed to the Phase 2 Eli Lilly studies back in 1990s. There were similar discontinuation rates between KarXT (20%) and placebo (21%).

Reward:

Best case scenario, is compare this to the drug Abilify (aripiprazole) by BMY. They hit 7.4 billion in peak sales in 2011. As the best selling atypical antipsychotic used to treat the same things KarXT is targeting but with far worse side effects, if KarXT becomes a similar blockbuster and becomes favored by clinicians for its better adverse effect profile, then if this shit hits global peak sales of over 7 billion in the future, we can apply a conservative biotech industry average of 3x multiple to sales to generate a market cap of 21 billion. That would take years (like by 2030) but represent 1100% upside to the current price. More realistically, I would expect the company gets bought out well before then.

Also more realistcally, other actual analysts such as from Citi project peak unadjusted sales estimate in schizophrenia to $4.7B.  But, that is for schizophrenia alone. However, if KarXT eventually also proves to be effective in ameliorating psychosis with Alzheimer's, expect the peak sales estimate to climb towards that 7 billion.

Risks:

Your investment goes to zero because biotech.

Financials:

very solid. After phase 2 topline results, a public offering of 2.6 million shares priced at $96 a share should have added roughly 250 million in cash. Their 3rd quarter 2019 financial update showed cash balance of 161 million and they projected that amount ALONE was enough to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2021. This includes multiple clinical and development milestones INCLUDING a Phase 3 clinical trial of KarXT in psychosis related to schizophrenia. So, at a cash pile of 411 million to start in 2020, we should expect a low probabilty of further offerings or dilution to the stock in the near future.

Tldr:

&#x200B;

KRTX is severely underpriced relative to its significantly derisked pipeline drug KarXT. You can observe its stock price has climbed everyday of actual high volume with the big boys buying but has been dumped by MM/algo/panicked retail investors on low volume days. Its public offering price at NINETY SIX dollars a share in November 2019 after phase 2 results means that should be the price FLOOR for this stock at this stage. That is a 33.6% upside to yesterday’s close.

This stock will take likely another year plus to realize the results of Phase 3 and then FDA submission after that.

DD,Beyond Air XAIR DD,20,el6xlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/el6xlm/beyond_air_xair_dd/,35,1578403401.0,"u/DrUNC83 mentioned this company in the daily discussion and I thought I'd take a look at it.

I work in healthcare and there's a lot of money made using nitric oxide to treat pulmonary hypertension of the newborn in NICU's.  The problem is the hospital has to store the heavy tanks, replace the tanks, and if I remember correctly they have an expiration.  So if they're not used, they're out of luck.  Beyond Air has created a one-of-a-kind machine that creates nitric oxide from ambient air.  No tanks.  They're sitting at a market cap of 75M right now and FDA approval for their machine is supposed to happen this quarter.  Will it get approved? There has been ZERO SAEs during trials.  There is no reason the FDA doesn't approve this. Institutional holdings have increased as have insider buying in the last 3-6 months. 

They're also trying to market toward disease processes that aren't normally treated with NO.  That could be huge for them.  Their trial out of Israel showed a decreased length of stay for patients with bronchiolitis.

The downside, if they do get approved sales are only likely to be around 300M.  They come with a proprietary filter that has to be replaced, so there's additional revenue but still your probably only looking at a 2-3 bagger max in the next year or two.  No option chain either.

Anyways, thought I'd share.  [https://www.beyondair.net/](https://www.beyondair.net/)",2020-01-07 08:23:21

P.S. - As Uber cuts down its incentive spend (through reduced competition and increased focus on profitability across competitors) and R&D, they'll move towards profitability. 

On top of that - just a quick note, 
Uber's acquisition of Careem officially closing, Uber's global portfolio includes a stake in the leader in every region where they don't operate themselves.

• 15% of Didi (China) 
• 23% of Grab (SEA)
• 38% of Yandex (Russia)
• 100% of Careem (Middle East)

The approximate value of Uber's stake in each at current values:

• Didi: ~$9B
• Grab: ~$3B
• Yandex Taxi: $1.5B
• Careem: ~$3B

Subtract out the above $16.5B of value and the $7B of cash net of long term debt they have and the core business is being valued at ~$30B today. ~2x Lyft & valued at 2x sales.

Seems low.

Buy, buy, buy.

The current price of the $95C for 2/21 are all 0.90-0.95, speculating an upside of just 5% from it's current levels. I added to my position today with 20 calls for the above option.

Current state of affairs:

Starbucks has been going through management changes over the last year to ensure that both the staff and management teams are properly trained after the racist blunder that occurred last year. Since then, Starbucks has gained a strong reputation for their service.

On the financial side of things, Starbucks has had a 10% year-over-year growth since 2016. This year, they are set to report -4% revenue compared to last year as a result of the China expansion and headwinds from the geopolitical shit storm between the US/China. Nonetheless, analyst believe that Starbucks will continue to grow as it has owns a large proportion of marketshare in this space with only few serious competitors like LK. Cashflow as of now is in the ballpark of $5B, with about 3B leveraged at the moment. As per the marketcap, they are at \~107B, with revenues sitting in the 26B range. They are only trading 4 times their revenue which makes this stock relatively affordable for a food/drinks related industry.

I presume that in this coming year, when the second phase of the trade talks are signed (Jan 15), the market will readjust and Starbucks will be aligned for meeting it's high (which currently is about 9% shy of the top). ER should be a beat and guidance should be raised with the addition of 2,000 stores world wide, and an average ROI of 70% in the 2018 fiscal year for the Chinese franchises and 50% ROI for domestic locations. 

On the options side of things, there is a lot of interest in the $90-100 Call range between 1/17-2/21 expiration. As of today, the short interest volume sits at 635k vs. total volume of 7.3 million (relatively low, but not a cause for concern).

There is plenty of room to run boys. Let's get out there with some fire plays, buy some of that Starbucks Coffee, and make those fire posts mid January.

Here's a legitimate reason to become a bear cuck that you can still mask as autistic, because it sure as hell sounds it - but it's actually supported by *real* data believe it or not. I have linked the academic study below if you want to read (you don't) but here's the short-ish version: 

The lunar cycle is the 1 month rotation of the moon around the earth and the different stages are marked by how the moon appears in the night sky. Every 2 weeks there is a full moon (full circle visible), and then two weeks later there is a new moon (no visible moon), and in the middle there is all sorts of half moons and crescent moons. The cycle repeats on and on and on every month. 

Just as the gravitational forces move the water on earth and cause the ocean tides, these particular alignments of the sun, moon and earth also cause chemical reactions in our brain (not sure what kind, but just go with it). On the dates of full and new moons there are higher suicide rates, higher aggression in schizophrenics, more hospital admissions, greater crime rates, all sorts of shit ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_effect) ). In short, the lunar cycle affects human psychology - a huge factor that affects the stock market, wouldn't you agree?  

Well it just so happens that stock markets exhibit unusual returns surrounding specific points in the lunar cycle. Stock returns are found to be lower on the days around a full moon than on the days around a new moon. This leads to an out performance of 3% to 5% per year if you consider the lunar cycle in your portfolio. i.e sell around a full moon, and buy around a new moon. 3-5% is pussy shit to be left for r/investing and tbh they are way too rational to base their portfolio on the moon. However, someone here ought to buy this moon theory, and by using options instead of a plain stock portfolio maybe that 3-5% could become 3-5,000%, no? 

At first I thought this sounded crazy, but you can look at a chart and see the effects for yourself. Below is the S&P500 with an overlay of the full and new moons. You can clearly see the market turning from bull to bear and vice versa at a new/full moon - particularly when emotions are ruling the market e.g. Q4 2018 - look at that bottom.

Anyway, today (10th Jan 2020) was a full moon - when market returns are usually depressed. Not only that, it was a special kind of full moon known as a 'Wolf Moon', because it was the first full moon of the year - and wouldn't you know markets were negative.. coincidence? I think not. (BBC wolf moon report:  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51066892](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51066892) ) 

The market has been overbought for the past 3 months now and IMO this is the final signal we needed for the bears to take over. Today was negative and I'm calling the top. Monday the 13th of Jan, soon to be known as Black Monday, will be devastating - down >10% at the open at least. I hope you can buy some OTM puts in time or already have some. 

**Enjoy your tendies.**  

TL;DR - it was a full moon today so buy OTM $SPY puts or short SPY

People will get hyped about the free 40% without understanding whats going on.

Let me break it down for you.

Buy Nlok now 26.45 cents

Own Nlok from January 23rd till Feb 3rd (you have to own past Jan 31st to get dividend you won't be able to sell till Feb. 3rd cause weekend).

You will receive 12 dollars per share congrats.

So what's the catch?

The stock is now worth 14.45, you were JUST given your money back not a magical 40% gain. Put's and calls will be adjusted accordingly it's a 0 sum game.

So how do you make money? Well I'm not smart enough to tell you that, but its probably going to get a lot of headlines and alot of people buying running the price up because they don't understand. There will also probably be a sell off after the dividend.

I'd say the best time to get into this stock is after the selloff for the long term hold potential of the company.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**What the fuck is CRC?**

California Resources Corporation is the largest oil/gas producer in California. This bitch was spun off from OXY in 2014, and boy was it bad. They stripped them of their accounts receivables but left them with their accounts payables -> debt basically fucked them for years and still does. As a result it's one of the highest beta stocks on the market (I believe **the**highest in the E&P sector). Peak post spin debt of about $7bn and currently just under $5bn of debt with about $1.2-1.4bn of EBITDAX projected for this year. CRC is a traditional steamflood producer \*\*(emphasis, CRC does not utilize fracking),\*\*which in turns makes it's wells low declining (7-10% a year declines vs some of the 40%+ first year declines we see in shale plays).

**What's the deal with it now?**

Yeah, looks bad. From a post spin peak of about $90 when oil was ripping back them to a low of nearly $3 a few months ago right before Q3 earnings. This is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, with a short interest of \~40% currently. The stock made a run up in 2018 all the way up to $50 to get shit on for all of 2019 down to where it is now. I've been long on the equity since $7 in 2017, and have been trading options in and out of it for the last year. Lot of fear mongering in the company and it's ability to repay debt, along with CA being batshit crazy legislative wise over oil.

**The company itself and pros/cons**

I saw this thing run up from $7 to $50, and I think it can do it again; and profiting on the volatility on the way isn't bad. This management team is stellar, Todd Stevens has one massive dick and has stated he's not afraid to play chicken with the shorts. They've been pretty much cash flow positive through this entire low cycle of oil (Sub $70 Brent, sub $65 for pretty much the whole part) and have worked towards paying back debt while similar shale companies are on the verge of blowing up since their well declines have been drastically understated and no one wants to lend to these mfs anymore.

WSJ article on issues with Shale here:

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-shale-wells-age-gap-between-forecasts-and-performance-grows-11577631601](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-shale-wells-age-gap-between-forecasts-and-performance-grows-11577631601)

two big cons of CRC:

* Massive Debt, main reasoning for the price decline  

   * Huge debt wall in 2021/2022, which if you don't come up with a large source of cash or pay off enough to refi it's going to bury you.
   * They've made strides to buying back their debt on the open market; I believe since the start of this year they've bought back about $250MM or so of their 2nd Liens at a 30% discount or something like that (feel free to correct me on their IR page), but it's not significant enough with how big the mountain is with small repurchases
* Oil Pricing  

   * It seems like most people in the space are chanting lower for longer. If Brent plummets under $60, we're gonna have a hard time paying back debt. At $60, it's not CHP11, but it's not great either. Long story short Brent staying around or even over $70 for the next year or two is going to help a lot with the debt reduction process. Note that CRC receives Buena Vista pricing, which trades currently at a \~$3 premium to Brent.
* CA Legislation  

   * Yeah we're fuckin democrats and they hate oil and big money shit yada yada. Bills get proposed all the time, and they tank the stock. They never pass. AB345? and the recent fracking one are great examples. Shit tanked 30%+ just to recover the next day when that shit dies. CA is a **DRIVING STATE** and that won't change, not everyone is buying a TSLA just get (I know praise our god Elon). And it's oil dependent. No piplines. 70%+ of it's crude is imported. From where you ask? Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, etc. Oh do I need to mention those places are kinda in a sticky spot right now?
* There's a lot of hit pieces on CRC you can find on SeekingAlpha; most of them will pretty much reiterate the same two points. Lots of debt, low oil prices, company is fucked.

**Why I think it's a winner**

Alright I'm getting kind of lazy, so I'm linking Seth Lowry, CFA's comments from SA here, I know it's on a fucking forum but this is probably the most insightful comment into CRC I've ever seen. Scroll down near the bottom of the comments, it's **really** long so you can't miss it:

Edit: Can't post direct SA link so here's an imgur gallery of his comment. If you want to get the link to just read the discussion I'm happy to PM.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/8MYsjUt](https://imgur.com/gallery/8MYsjUt)

For you fucks that are too lazy to read it, long story short:

The debt wall is definitely there, but it's still \~2 years out. Management has time. And management has been calculated. Listen to any of their conference calls (if you're not fuckin lazy) and they have been reiterating the same message for the last 2 years, and been consistent on it. Instead of a silver bullet, a multi-pronged approach to delevering gives them the best shot:

* ORRI - basically a royalty sale. CRC owns Elk Hills, which is a massive fucking field in Cali. If they sell $50MM a year of production, at a 16-20x multiple, that could be up to $1bn to use towards debt repayment. $RRC recently did a few ORRIs at 12-14x multiples, and those were gas, high (20%+) declines. We're talking oil, low, 7-10% declines.
* Midstream Assets - CRC has $1bn+ worth of midstream assets they can still monetize, examples have already been done before ie with Ares, still viable.
* Huntington Real Estate Sale - CRC owns \~90ish acres of prime beach real estate in Cali. Why? I forget and I don't fucking care. Just know that there was a bid on it back in 2010 for $300mm. I work in REPE, and that shit is definitely worth a lot more now. Sam Zell just did a JV with CRC. **Yeah, the billionaire, real estate Sam Zell**. Wonder if need be he would have any interest in taking some of that?
* Debt Repurchasing - Hell yeah these bonds trade at a fucking discount, and management knows it. They stated on the last call, why even bother chucking all our FCF at exploration right now? Our second liens trade at literal 75% discount, we have \~$1bn of JV capital in hand to drill with, and buying our bonds gives us a straight 200%+ IRR right off the bat.  

   * *Sidenote, the JVs are mostly done with clauses that allow the interests to revert back to CRC once a certain hurdle has been hit, 2 which were done with BSP partners and Macquarie are due to revert any day now, where CRC's interest in the cash flow reverts from \~10-15% to the majority \~80%. This should add $100MM+ to the topline when they do.*
* The Macro Picture - Tension in the middle east, Iran today, dur. Mohamed Bone Saw briefly got his $2tn, but that doesn't mean jack shit unless he can IPO the rest internationally and secure his tendies. He's an autist just like us and is long hella OTM in $OIL. So bet your ass he's going to do anything and push any narrative he can to get Oil up.  

   * U.S. shale production, which has been the biggest driver in oil supply in so many years looks like it's finally tapering off. These fucks can barely keep up at $65 brent, look at the frac spreads and how badly the rig count has dropped. And to anyone who says they can just ramp up production when they want if oil rips up, the fuck? You seen how much debt these guys owe? Makes CRC look like peanuts. I think it's $100BN+ over the next 5 years? With Tier 1 acreage running out? And totally restricted lending? If anything, the downfall of some of these other players will be a godsend to CRC. Investors (already have) will pull out shale, leaving only the big boys and will seek other, actual value investments. Look no further than $HAL and $SLB both taking $10BN+ impairments the last quarter in the NA divisions.

Some people point out that the company could have issued new equity last year when the stock was near $50, that would have brought in some cash that could have been used to pay down debt; in hindsight they might point out it was stupid not to, but management has made it a point that they haven't had to issue much equity since the spin period. I think it's a testament to their situation. They're not as desperate as they seem and have a few options to pull from. Listen to the BAML transcript if you can from \~2 months back. Todd mentioned a JV upcoming soon, potential real estate monetization ""within a few months"", and confirmed there has been a party they are in talks with about the ORRI. I will say the firms PR is pretty trash at keeping investors up to date with all that's going on, which is why there's still a heavy downward pressure on the stock. It's a ""show me"" type of company. But we broke $10 today, and most of the shorts really came in at the teens. A bit higher and we could see a short squeeze of legendary proportions.

TL,DR: $CRC calls, or put credit spreads. I'd say May 2020 if you're ballsy, 2021-2022 leaps are good play. I'm currently doing both - naked calls for May 2020 at $10 strike, then 3 option bull strats for 2021-2022, a put credit spread and then a call on both. As well as the equity in my IRA and accounts with my financial advisor because I am a sick fuck. Feel free to inverse me and post positions.

edit: RH positions so u mfs don't ban me, rest is just equity in my TDA and IRA but you tards wouldn't understand the graphics anyways. Depending on how the picture looks after Q4 earnings I plan on throwing a few thousand more in calls if it's good. Look for mgmt to make good progress on the 2L and give a meaningful update on JV/ORRI so we can hit that \~$3bn overall debt mark. I think if that can happen no reason why over the next year or two this can't have another crazy run up. Their PV-10 reserves at $65 brent alone are worth \~$5bn+, chuck in another $2bn of infrastructure assets and land holdings, if you run the numbers fair share price should be really in the $20s right now, which is where it was when brent was trading in this range back in May. Just lots of short pressure keeping it down.

**EDIT 2: Thank you** [**u/Dmillehe**](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dmillehe) **spending his money on Platinum instead of AMZN stock. You're the real autist.**

Amazon is going to dominate the next decade. It's a wonderful business trading at a discount to it's true ability to create cash earnings. My thesis is that traditional methods of valuation that work for most companies don't work for Amazon. This misunderstanding between market 'conservatives' or 'traditionalists' .. so called value oriented investors (of which I consider myself a part) is currently reflected in the share price today, and it's a mistake. Second, the firm has reached a point of inflection, where scale will now provide growth of earnings far in excess of growth in sales. This multiyear catalyst provides a fundamental basis for significant share price appreciation.

To understand why Amazon presents such a compelling investment opportunity, one must understand what is currently transpiring in two specific and unique business segments. E-commerce and Cloud Computing. Many of you are probably familiar with at least the former. The latter is foreign territory to most.

**E-Commerce: Why Amazon is prepared to conquer the next decade in retail.**

Traditional retail or brick and mortar (B&M from here on out) is still the dominant form of consumer spending in the U.S. and will be for some time. [As of Q3 2019, total retail spend amounts to $5.4 Trillion dollar for the prior 12 months.](https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf) E-commerce amounts to merely 11.2% of this amount (on a run rate basis.) While the size remains relatively small, e-commerce is growing in the mid-teens year over year, or now 5% quarter to quarter and the rate of growth is accelerating. The rate of E-commerce growth has doubled in 12 months.

To understand why this is the case, a qualitative evaluation of the differences between the two is critical. B&M requires physical space that is expensive to build and maintain. It requires uniformed, reliable, friendly and knowledgeable staff. It requires the deliberate presentation of inventory and restocking, amounting to a unique challenge to the retailer of determining layout of shelf space, product mix and promotion.

It's costly for the consumer too. They have to drive there, walk in, and find what they are looking for. This requires owning a car or putting up with public transportation. This can take a significant amount of time. There are some hidden costs too, without E-commerce, price discovery is a pain in the ass. Something retailers are keenly aware of. Here's something interesting about humans and economics. In economics, for a long time, we've modeled humans like they're these perfect rational beings. Ideally.. they'll drive down the road to a different store to get 3% off of whatever they're buying. Ideally. And you **will** do that for a car. But in reality, if it's 3% off a bag of chips, it's not worth the hassle. It's too expensive to go get $.14 of savings when you have to drive another 10 minutes to another grocery, walk in to figure it out if you're actually saving the most money.. consumers don't do that.

Consumers don't engage in price discovery on most of their small dollar purchases, they don't do that with traditional retail, because it's too costly in time and effort. There's too much friction in the trade-off.

The value proposition of E-commerce is that it saves consumers time and money. Getting in the car, loading the kids in the back, driving, parking, and then hunting for what you want, making sure you are getting a fair price, E-commerce throws all of that out the window. The value proposition for retailers too, is that it saves them time and money. There are plenty of retailers currently taking an omni-channel approach to retail, those who want to shop in person get to, those who shop online can do that too.. everybody wins. E-commerce takes the friction out of price discovery on small dollar purchases.

Given the advent of mobile computing more than a decade ago, many big box retailers also adopted a price match strategy, if you can find it online for the same price? Best Buy, Micro Center etc. they'll match it to keep you as a customer. But that's the extent of it, try going to Kroger and arguing with the cashier about Albersons having a 3/$5 deal on Frito Lay Potato Chips.. that ain't happening.

Amazon isn't Ecommerce, they are a part of it. Their strategy is different than the whole. They are technically omni-channel. However the little B&M they've done mostly as R&D experiment, more on Whole Foods in a minute. The Amazon E-Commerce thesis is this: **At the end of the day, most consumer purchases are commodity purchases.** They are small dollar items that are easily replicated. This segment of retail has yet to be disrupted by E-Commerce until now. It overlaps with specialty retail and big box items almost seamlessly from a logistical standpoint. The revenue streams are more stable than specialty retail, and it presents a massive opportunity in the long run.

I had the chance to speak with a finance manager at Frito-Lay (subsidiary of PepsiCo) years back after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Amazon had been attempting for years to get the same products you see in any Kroger or Albertsons onto their platform. For a variety of reasons, PepsiCo would not play ball with Amazon. It amounted to channel conflicts between the big established players vs. the disruptive incumbent. What Pepsico had done to Amazon, had been done by Proctor and Gamble, Nestle, Kellogg, and many more.

The purchase of Whole Foods was a big F U, a ""we'll do it live"" moment.. a Leeroy Jenkins. So you won't let us into your club? Fine, we'll do it ourselves. [Grocer's panicked and for good reason](https://qz.com/1211449/amazon-is-wreaking-havoc-on-grocers-like-albertsons/). They were the reason Amazon had been held at bay for so long. They'd used their absolute size for many years to prevent E-commerce retailers from getting the same product mix at the same price online. Amazon responded by entering their territory, in buying a physical grocery chain. Grocer's fear was real and warranted, however the truly brilliant component of this purchase was that Amazon purchased for themselves a supply chain for grocery and private label products (365 brand.) Fast forward a couple years and Amazon now has over [four hundred private label brands, more than twenty three thousand individual SKUs and 1.4 Million reviews of these products/brands.](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon-private-label-brands) That entire article is worth a thorough read. Each product line represents a moonshot where amazon can collect both sides of margin on a private label product that disrupts traditional brands. Often it goes well, sometimes it does not, but the platform allows them to poke holes in each product category, and cannibalize the producer surplus of other more expensive branded product in the process. They don't have to advertise, market or promote any of this either.. yet [it's already getting plenty of attention](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1120847137149833217?lang=en). 

[Here is a compelling example of how Amazon can undercut a premium brand with it's store brand knock off.](https://medium.com/@joeyzwillinger/dear-mr-bezos-e691f6d6d705) And there's nothing Allbirds can do about it.

Amazon has built out an infrastructure of warehouses (which are relatively cheaper to maintain on a $/sf basis than traditional B&M retail space) and delivery drivers to meet the daily needs of consumers accustomed to B&M retail. They've disinter-mediated the entire process. You do not need a car, you don't have to be nice to the person behind the counter, or go hunting for that specific product you need on aisle 9, or check to see if the price is competitive or on deal. You can just type it in to your phone in 5 seconds, and see quickly who has the best deal. Turns out (and this is from experience) 9/10 times Amazon has the best deal and they'll ship it that day or the next.

For the consumer, it amounts to savings in both time and money. What the data shows is that we are experiencing rapid change in slow motion. E-commerce is growing explosively here in the U.S. however it's still of relatively small scale, that it will take some time before eclipsing B&M retail. Second, the data shows this rate of growth is accelerating, and has **doubled in the last year or so**. Traditional retail is not going to disappear entirely either. There are plenty of Amazon proof businesses for now. Hair salons, vets, dentists, nail salons, along with restaurants and apparel to a certain extent.

This online E-commerce platform has allowed Amazon to build out a peripheral advertising business in search. The search component allows Amazon to promote it's own store brand product alongside the branded counterparts. Second, it's able to sell web page space to branded products. [Google currently dominates the search game, but Amazon is in 2nd place and stealing market share.](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-gaining-google-search-advertising-market-share/)

Finally, Amazon has rolled out a wonderful product called [Subscribe and Save](https://www.amazon.com/Subscribe-Save/b?ie=UTF8&node=5856181011). Within this platform, Amazon is able to offer 15%-20% savings on everyday commodity items in exchange for a commitment to purchase at a monthly frequency (and it can be cancelled at any time.) What Amazon has discovered is that subscription purchases are relatively sticky. In exchange for a soft commitment from consumers that is relatively stable and predictable, Amazon can actually lower the cost of goods to the consumer. In turn, they are also able to optimize logistically for these sales as they can plan far in advance for them. Second, this allows them to relay demand information to other merchants as well. Example: Amazon can remit data to Tide, and let them know how many pods they expect to need in the coming months based on subscription commitments. Both Tide and Amazon are able to lower CoGS because they have more time to plan for those costs.

Furthermore, if you have an Amazon Credit Card through Chase bank, [you get an additional 3%-5% all purchase at Amazon & Whole Foods.](https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/amazon/earn-rewards)

The combination of all of these benefits as a platform amounts is an incredibly compelling value proposition to consumers. As of June this year Amazon has accumulated [105 Million Prime Memberships in the United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/546894/number-of-amazon-prime-paying-members/), and it is the largest paid subscriber base of any company in the United States period.

One of the luxuries I enjoy in my occupation is that my employer has a very long investment time horizon & high risk tolerance. What this allows is for us to kick back, put our feet on the table and think about what the world will look like in 10 years and how we'd consider being a part of it.

So here's a thought experiment, what do you think the retail experience for consumers looks like in a decade? Here's my prediction. Consumer's buy the vast majority of the things they need online, and they receive it within a few hours to a day, and they're spending less than ever before on what they need. [This is already happening](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-effect-inflation-deflation-2017-10), and [It's grabbed the attention of people like Jim Cramer](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/cramer-remix-amazon-still-one-of-most-powerful-deflationary-forces.html), as well as [Fed Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2018/04/07/is-amazon-holding-back-inflation/#7c8985593c02). Albeit, E-Commerce is relatively small for now, but the rapid transformation is already causing ripple effects across retail. In 10 years, my thesis is that E-commerce becomes the largest component of total retail sales and Amazon remains the largest component of that segment, as it is today. Additionally, they probably steal share and grow at a faster pace than E-commerce as a whole, as they have done over the last several years.

**Personal anecdote:**

I'm sitting here in my home office wearing [Amazon branded Jeans](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Mens-Slim-Fit-Stretch/dp/B07BJL18M5/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=amazon+jeans&qid=1578627734&s=apparel&sr=1-1). I've got 10+ Amazon branded undershirts upstairs, along with 5+ pairs of Amazon Synthetic Golf Shorts. In my house, we've got Amazon branded batteries, note cards & printer paper, detergent pods, echo devices, cameras and more all over the place. There's more too, but I'm not going to list it all. In my experience, what they make is just as good if not better than the branded counterpart, and they do it for less, often a lot less. And I got tired of hyperlinking, so if you're curious, go to [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) and start looking around for these products.

Even more, as of now my wife and I spend +$250/mo on subscribe and save items we need for our household, this includes baby formula, diapers and wipes, detergent, shampoo and soap, trash bags, dog food, paper towels and more. We use the 5% back credit card and blended save close to 20% on these daily items we need.

**In conclusion, on E-Commerce, I expect Amazon to dominate the next decade in retail. They have a massive competitive advantage over other retailers engaged in an omni-channel strategy, therefore it's their game to lose. Furthermore, their competitive edge today will compound into the future and amount to further share gains and a wider moat in years to come.**

**Cloud Computing: What is this industry, how does Amazon fit in the picture, and why is it such a big deal?**

Again, to understand Amazon you'll have to understand what Cloud Computing is. This is not an everyday consumer product/service, therefore it's foreign to most individuals. Second, because the transactions and services are business to business (B2B) it's relatively difficult to determine detailed industry characteristics. What may come as a surprise to you, is it's the most profitable business segment (on a NOPAT basis) and it's also their fastest growing segment.

Cloud computing is the service of providing storage, services, databases, software, security, analytics, artificial intelligence and infrastructure through the internet. There was a time when most businesses built their own server racks, and maintained their own infrastructure. Amazon too did this for themselves in building out their own infrastructure to maintain their E-Commerce platform. In time, they naturally sold this service to other firms.

So where does Amazon fit in now? From all indications cloud computing appears to be an arms race. The most recent estimates for market share vary depending on the research provider. The differences lie in what is being measured. There are multiple components of Cloud: PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS. By all accounts, Amazon Web Services is the clear market leader, but they aren't growing as fast as some of their well funded peers like Microsoft and Google.

The available literature on Cloud Computing as a whole is vague. There are important questions to answer regarding structural advantage or lack thereof, who has the competitive edge, or what kind of moats have been built. Amazon's slowing growth rate in Cloud is concerning. Ramped spend in R&D + SG&A during the 2019 fiscal year is encouraging, and these investments will reduce erosion of market share.

While Cloud remains Amazon's most profitable business segment for now, by revenue it's just \~12.5% of sales. Admittedly I am troubled by the amount of information I cannot obtain without significantly paying out of pocket. Nevertheless, given the relative size of this business, I'm comfortable putting the pencil down on AWS for now, and watching the industry closely going forward.

**Other Business Segments:**

Amazon has other business segments like their own B&M retail stores including Whole Foods, it's [4 star retail chain](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=20017628011&ref=AMZ4STR_GoogleListing_JDA1) as well as it's cashierless Amazon Go stores. All of these combined are worth little compared to the market cap, while interesting.. they are insignificant in determining Amazon's value as a business.

**What is Amazon worth today?**

Herein lies the problem for analysts when the look at Amazon. The most commonly used methods for determining value are off the charts, for the most part Amazon looks like lighting money on fire.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7iq4kk8hesa41.png?width=1703&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7b8a9fb6090406db8e0ddd51e9e776062b646cd

A simple value oriented investor looks at a trailing P/E of 84.19 and thinks **why would I wait 84 years to get paid back?**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d76fratiesa41.png?width=1689&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc4e3e57054f658a33a7173084e1a5338da1997

Of course, that's too myopic, and value oriented investors who take that approach, quickly learn trailing P/E is the key to building a portfolio of value traps. More sophisticated investors like [Joel Greenblatt](http://www.poslovni.hr/media/PostAttachments/1203672/Joel%20Greenblatt%20-%20The%20Little%20Book%20That%20Beats%20the%20Market.pdf) might recommend using something like ROIC to gauge how much Amazon benefits from reinvesting and building out it's own business.

The problem with that approach is that ROC, ROCE, and ROIC all use some form of GAAP earnings (either NOPAT or EBIT) to backsolve for this return number. If you look at Amazon's Income Statement, and dissect why net income is what it is there's a good reason why most value metrics/ratios don't work for Amazon. They are investing \~3x NOPAT and 60% of Gross profit into R&D. SG&A tells a similar story. What is R&D anyways? One time costs to develop and build out a business. What is SG&A, variable manpower with a significantly lagged ROI when ramped more than 20% YoY.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/15v33d1lesa41.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4562988962ffc48d858a24b2a190b4db65f4c3d

What dawned on me months ago is this.. what if Amazon cut it's R&D to 0, and didn't touch SG&A? P/E TTM drops to \~20x. What happens to sales growth then? It slows.. and eventually converges with GDP, and then falls beyond that. The story of what Amazon's business is, especially E-Commerce, helps shed light on how long it'd take for Amazon's growth to converge with GDP, when they're on the cutting edge of the knife, and most other competitors remain far behind.

What do other institutions believe Amazon is worth?

https://preview.redd.it/wuzx3n6nesa41.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=959d83285bb9f67715415a9011802e6039d72d2d

There are 45 Wallstreet Analysts covering the stock. On average, their price target is 2170. Based on the share price today, if they're right, you can expect a 15% return. What if the bears are right? You'll lose \~2% rounding down. And the bulls? the highest estimate is 2550, and represents a 35% premium on the stock.

Here's what Morningstar thinks:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/capam6koesa41.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ae1e2e6b91882f60c01dec9cb983c8439ccfa8

Keep in mind, the last price is a bit dated. Let's pretend Morningstar is right, I like them more than most analysts. You can expect a 22% return.

I don't like wall street analysts, if I did, I wouldn't do this, and I'd just follow their guidance. They are often right, but can be very wrong at times. The problem with wall street analysts is that they are subject to herding, as well as many other behavioral biases and sometimes conflicts of interest.

But assuming they're right, this is an asymmetric long to take, with significant upside today.

I have an estimate for fair value as well. This involves taking the current growth rate for amazon as well as the mean estimate of earnings two years out. However, instead of earnings, I like mean cash flow per share, because it remains undistorted by GAAP adjustments.

Here are the current cash flow per share estimates:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9e4sgdmqesa41.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=d878cacc7620af283233c63ab493c6500b55ba0c

Here is my valuation model:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3pqriw0sesa41.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=16810d9c5ad87ca7b10b01ae3cb590e774f28340

Bottom left in yellow: that is the implied value of AMZN shares today, based on the discounted free cash flows.

Bottom middle with a red circle around it, those are my assumptions for long term growth rate and EPS 2 years out.. so TTM 2021 cash flows.

This would imply a 63% upside on the share price today.

Now, I don't think anyone is getting 63% today, for AMZN shares. Admittedly I'd be surprised if you got \~$3100 for AMZN shares in a year. Unfortunately.. this business will probably continue to be misunderstood like it has been for many years until they're done reinvesting a significant portion of their gross profit into building the infrastructure that expands their business. However, that cash flow number will become remarkably close to EPS with R&D turned off. When it does, share price will rocket. Instead of this becoming a one time event, I expect convergence will be gradual over time, which makes it a long term hold.

**More on valuation:**

I was disappointed but not surprised to find [I'm not the only one thinking about valuation in this way](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/AMAZON.COM_INC/0950248237#description). The authors take is similar to mine, and he comes to a similar conclusion as well: \~20x P/E TTM. I've gone through everything the VIC has to say about AMZN and most everything should be available to you as non-members as it is dated. I found message 109 especially compelling:

**In Conclusion:** I recommend Amazon stock as a long term investment. I believe this is one of the best value propositions available in this market. Regardless of the broader stock market, the secular trends within retail are significant tailwinds to Amazons largest business segment.

**Disclaimer:** This document is entirely my own work, outside of linked/pictured information above which has been cited. I own a significant amount of AMZN stock personally. I am not responsible for your gains or losses. I may add more information to this document in the future.

**Addendum (1/14/20):** The most significant risk to this business is political. The election of either Warren or Sanders in November of this year would most certainly affect valuation for this business in the near term. Whether Amazon is actually harmed by political interference is another story. For now, it appears the odds that either of these candidates receives the nomination is significantly below 50%, furthermore, as of now it appears they would be significantly disadvantaged against the orange man. Consider this tail risk.",2020-01-14 21:28:36

From 2000-2013, OKcupid, Match, Eharmony and Plenty of Fish (POF) ruled the dating world. ¾ are now owned by $MTCH. Currently, Tinder rules the scene. It’s easy to see why online dating has been successful, but what makes these sites profitable and why the fuck would you want to invest?  

$MTCH’s has seen [steady growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/449390/quarterly-revenue-match-group/) each quarter since they’ve hit the market, and even with the IAC split, they've still been going strong 

And while $MTCH owns quite a few dating companies, the biggest money makers for them are Match.com, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and by far, Tinder.   
   
Match.com has always been free to look, but pay to play. Want to message that cute girl? Pay us $30 a month. Then there is the 3-month guarantee that you'll find the one, put another $90 behind that, sucka. It’s not nearly as prolific as it once was, but it’s still currently the home to some desperate ladies who think a paid site will weed out the thirsty dudes, and of course, the same average thirsty dudes.   
   
OKcupid is currently suffering a fate worse than death: A lack of identity. It was the most celebrated and lauded free dating website until about 2017, when it was eventually taken over by $MTCH. They took everything people loved about it and tossed it out the window. It now resembles a clunky Tinder wannabe with math and more bots than Wall-E. How do they make money? A-list, something that men can even gift to women they like, which those ladies in turn, can go find some other dude on the site to date. Touché, OkCupid. Unfortunately, the site is such a mess that it’ll be completely dead in a few years, if not, this year.   
   
Plenty of Fish…sigh. I’ll be honest; this is the Wal-Mart of online dating. I’ve only ever been on one date from the site years ago. She tricked me with her angles and I swore off the site, never to look back. Its user base hasn’t changed much over the years according to most, and houses some of the most bottom of the barrel people to exist in the U.S. It also surprisingly-unsurprisingly still has the most activity of any online dating site or app. Boosted by its POF Premium package which apparently tricks people into thinking that it will help them get more matches, it’s been a good source of revenue for $MTCH since 2015.

Now to the moneymaker, Tinder, also owned by $MTCH. A few years ago, Tinder executed the ultimate drug dealer move; got people hooked for free then started charging people for it, and somehow maintained their user base.  They introduced Tinder+ ($20 a month) and Tinder Gold ($30 a month), along with super swipe, and boost, and most recently: Super Boost ($45-$100 depending on your area, for a ONE time use). You can go over to r/tinder to see what these paid tools have done to these horny guys. I myself haven’t had a date using Tinder since late 2018 and switched from it in early 2019, as I’m not a fan of paying to play. But the amount of free advertising it gets from movies, tv shows, podcast, comics, etc. is not something to take lightly. 

The one thing $MTCH won’t tell you about Tinder is their male to female ratio. The last time they did was in 2016, which even then was heavily skewed in favor of men. According to some recent studies, the male to female ratio is around 85% to 15%., but the popularity for the app has not decreased. One is to surmise that an increase in dudes is an increase in profits. 

Competition? Bumble is a good app that puts the “power” into women’s hands by having them make the first move, but as a recent hookup put it, “I got what men want, why would I need to waste effort by messaging first.” Where’d I meet this ""catch?” Hinge. Hinge, also owned $MTCH, has steadily become my go to in the last 2 years, as it has a nice interface, it’s easy to navigate and allows you to send a quick message along with your ‘like’ to get the lady’s attention. However, Bumble is increasing their users at a rapid rate and is only second to Tinder in regards to online dating apps, but it’s doubtful that they will ever pass Tinder.   
 

Facebook Dating is about 8 years too late. If POF is the Wal-Mart of dating, Facebook Dating is the Dollar Tree. Facebook is dominated by the 40+ crowd and won’t be relevant until they introduce Instagram dating, which would be an epic move on their part since it houses the majority of the people likely to use any of the aforementioned apps, sites previously mentioned.   
 

EHarmony?[😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/) [😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/) [😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)[😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)

To conclude in my experience, you can’t underestimate what $MTCH has. People are lazy and want to put as little effort into things as possible these days. Why talk to that hot girl sitting across from me in the coffee shop when I can I pull out an app and easily score a date with a 5/10. $MTCH has cornered the online dating marketing and as always, sex is in demand and like theta gang $MTCH sells both “calls” and puts” and people are buying both in bulk.

1.) We are at historically elevated valuations.   Somewhere between the Dotcom bubble and Black Tuesday in terms of PE.  Below is a chart of the current Schiller PE levels - this is a popular measure used by value investors such as Warren Buffet.    


Just so you know the historical average is somewhere in the 15 to 20 range. I would expect that to creep up due to low interest rates, but we're certainly well past 'safe' levels.

2.) Speaking of Pappa Buffet - he has been hoarding cash.  Berkshire Hathaway continues to grow its cash pile as there is 'nothing to buy' in this environment.  The chart is a bit old, but last I heard it was somewhere between 100 to 200 billion in cash sitting on the sidelines.  This is on a company with about a 500bil market cap. They would rather just sit on cash than risk getting caught with their pants down.

3.)  But... companies are crushing it and we live in the greatest economy the world has ever seen don't we???  Actually earnings have been pretty stagnant since 2015.  There are a few companies absolutely crushing it - namely big cap tech, but on average corporate earnings has been mediocre.    


P.S - This chart would look a hell of a lot worse if not for stock buybacks.

4.) Degenerate investment institutions are levered long and doing dangerous shit like shorting the VIX / running an excessive allocation of derivatives (Looking at you DB).  No one seems willing to admit that this is where the Repo Market money is going, and we can't really get a chart of that capital per-se, but we can find more generic information about margin levels.  


See some of those massive contractions in margin levels?  Generally speaking those aren't from deleveraging - when bubbles burst and portfolio values go down institutions and individuals begin facing margin calls... Forcing more selling, forcing more margin calls etc.  When the market is highly levered it creates a potential for alarmingly rapid draw-downs.

I won't even go into the details regarding how the global economy is also in shambles and fueled by debt too.  GDP numbers don't account for debt based growth and low interest rates everywhere has caused an explosion of cheap debt. This onion has far more layers than what's described here.

[Altaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaba) is the company left over when Yahoo! was bought out by Verizon. It was made up of various assets that in time we're sold off, with only 5 million shares of Alibaba stock left as the remaining part of its planned dissolution.

On Monday it [announced plans to liquidate 5 million shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/altaba-begins-sale-of-remaining-alibaba-stake-51579020598) in the ""days to come"" with 1 million shares sold that day. Daily movement of BABA is ~13 million shares, having 5 million shares unloaded over the course of the week has certainly impacted the price. 

Currently [Altaba.com](https://www.altaba.com/) has an updated tally on shares sold, ~3.4million as of today. Assuming they sold 1 million shares the day of the announcement then they have averaged ~800 million shares a day every day after (but likely not as linear as that).  That leaves 1.6 million shares to be sold on Friday (and possibly bleeding into Monday based on this assumed average).

Due to the dual listing nature of Alibaba we will see continued drops in prices on the US side that will in turn negatively impact the HK listing. Just as increased buying on one side has seen the recent driving up in price this rush of selling will see a spiraling effect in the short term.

My belief is the pricing decline will continue to $215-$219 until Altaba announces completion of the indicated sale (again likely early next week) plus a short period for the information to be disseminated (my hope is the close of next week) before we a rise of price.

With all that said this is a **buying opportunity in Calls.** Looking to buy 1/31 strikes on the cheap in anticipation of a slow rise in price and huge increase in interest for the first earnings call (Jan 28) since the dual listing went live.

Also targeting June calls as that will have put the HK listing at over the 6 months mark, which while not rule, will likely make it eligible for the ""Shanghai Hong Kong stock connect"". This will make Alibaba eligible for investment by mainland Chinese investors (many mistakenly believe the HK listing did that) which may materially affect pricing.

Also TSLA will hit $420 again....",2020-01-17 06:52:25

Let me introduce those of lesser knowledge among you to the Basic Bitch Becky Basic Business Cycle (most of you autists are very familiar, so this will be a quick recap).

Growth => Debt => Growth => Overspending => Inflation => Fed Acts to create recession

Okay, now what's the second last part of that cycle? Inflation. Inflation always precedes a recession(After all, if there's no inflation, the fed can simply turn on the printing presses and create as much growth as it wants). In the postwar period, we can find just one example of a recession which starts with an inflation rate lower than the current one(2.30%). That was July 1953, the exact date of the end of the Korean war. The ending of wars always creates recessions as war spending dries up and soldiers have to find new jobs, but these are short-lived and lead ultimately to new bull markets and all time highs. So if Trump pulls all US troops back from abroad will we get a recession? Yes. Long story short: He won't. Chart for quick ANALysis(tho relatively easy to make on your own on FRED's autist playground website):

https://imgur.com/O5U1UkY

Okay, moving on. We have had no recessions at these levels of inflation, yet we live in a time of far more aggressive money printing retards than ever before. The fed will pump as much as they can into the system, as they are now doing, because it makes them look good and makes Ms. Jerome's famous blowjobs just that much better. They will justify it with all sorts of hocus-pocus logic. (""Because inflation was below our magic 2% number for so long, we must now put inflation ABOVE the 2% money number for equally long time to break even!"" is one such 80IQ PHD rationale) 

Okay, but now the more discerning among you are asking: can't inflation ramp up very quickly, leading the current rates of inflation to be largely noninformative of future trends? Yes. However I have heard from many smart people that this is unlikely given the current state of the macro, the micro, and so forth. I defer your excellent question to them, and blame them fully if they are wrong.

Right now in the Basic Bitch Becky Basic Business Cycle we are currently at growth, just beginning to step into overspending as falling ""true"" rates of growth must be supplemented by fed funny money so that Lord Trump can win in 2020, Mr. Jerome keeps his job and everybody looks like they know what the fuck they're doing. No recession 2020, no recession 2021.

DD,SBUX Calls,15,epol86,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epol86/sbux_calls/,20,1579233391.0,"A week ago, I mentioned the SBUX $95 Calls 2/21 as a great buy at 0.95. They are currently looking nice. 

I've since dug a little deeper into SBUX to get a better outlook of what we might expect to hear for ER and guidance. 

As of now, SBUX owns about 10% of the coffee market. The numbers are even more staggering at nearly 40% of the market in the U.S alone. In 2019, Starbucks made a huge expansion of 2000+ locations, situating this franchise in more than 33,000 locations across the globe. Recently, their former CEO also announced plans to expand 100 community Starbucks stores by 2025 in specific low-income communities and hire locally. That's going to be great PR.

As of late, we can also see that Starbucks is also rising steadily from sub 90 to currently 92+ some change.  Earnings will be coming up, and we would likely beat EPS estimates but not my large margins as the additional revenue from the added locations will not take full effect until 1-2 years after it's establishment. But that means guidance will look strong coming into the rest of 2020. 

Not to mention, coffee is a staple for most, and the market that SBUX is aiming towards is diverse. 

I'm looking to add a few more $90/92.50 for March 20 expiration. Will be looking forward to ER and hopefully an 8 point increase in the coming month to get us back at the 52 year high. Charts are also looking strong with huge support at $90 and a building green candle coming off of the $90.50 area. As Trump would say, ""things are looking great"". ""very nice"".

Macros are extremely bullish due to expectation that low interest rates are here to stay (before we expect interesting rate to go back up at some point, but now, there is no chance of that). Bubble will form. TSLA is the FOTM stock, it will pop tremendously on a good earnings report.
2. Delivery number are very good at 112k. Delivery exceeded maximum production capacity as production is only at 105k (also a record, production is improving but gradually), so much so that I expect that there is a backlog going into Q1. An obvious piece of evidence for this is that Tesla has not reduced prices even though it has raised prices by $500 on Q4 2019. Last year Tesla drop prices substantially immediately in the first week of January.
3. If point 2 is true, then Elon will probably revise his expectation for Q1/Q2 2020 to be fairly profitable. If this happens the shorts will be FUBAR as the short thesis will completely crumble as Q1/Q2 2020 unprofitability is critical to the short thesis.
4. If point 2 is true, S&P inclusion will happen shortly after Q1 2020. Adding fuel to the expectation of an epic rise.
5. Model Y is expected to be released soon (my expectation is that it will release early Q2 2020), I remember the run up prior to release of Model 3. Taken all this together, the next few months has the potential for an absolutely epic run for TSLA.

DD,An Investigation into Aurora’s (ACB) financials,69,epkndq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epkndq/an_investigation_into_auroras_acb_financials/,39,1579216606.0,"Hi everyone- I’m a college student looking to enter the cannabis research field. In my free time, I like to write about publicly traded companies. Aurora (ACB) has intrigued me for the last few weeks so I wrote up a report about the company's liquidity risk. From some reformulation of the financial statements I think the market consensus that the company won't be able to afford its debt is wrong. I currently don't have money in ACB but I'll buy some stock after the write down of its Goodwill built up from the MedReleaf acquisition, which I think wiIl happen next quarter (Early Feb - May 2020).

TLDR- ACB’s liquidity issues are overblown and management is already in the process of mitigating them. The company is primed to outperform after its write down of Goodwill; could be a buy after it's announced.

Investors are spooked by ACB’s deteriorating margins and the most recent quarter’s loss. Through an analysis of the Q1 2020 financial statements, I think it’s pretty clear that the company’s cash and cash-like position is still strong enough to defend against increasingly high interest payments.

[https://assets.ctfassets.net/rhxhcf3cql1g/7p3Er952vcGekZovryfU7y/6969db5521c23a7f172d96805e5876e5/FS\_2019.09.30\_11.14.2019.pdf](https://assets.ctfassets.net/rhxhcf3cql1g/7p3Er952vcGekZovryfU7y/6969db5521c23a7f172d96805e5876e5/FS_2019.09.30_11.14.2019.pdf)

ACB’s stock price is down more than 70% over the last twelve months. The bear case is primarily driven by the threat of a liquidity trap where the company doesn’t have enough cash on hand to pay for its debt.

Let’s start by looking at the current financial picture. It’s a little tricky to understand the true debt profile because ACB reports it with most of its other income in the income statement. Fortunately, Note 13 gives some information about all payments outstanding (including the current and long-term debt the company owes). By using the metrics in this note, I am taking an extraordinarily conservative view of debt because it assumes all money owed can be considered “debt”, instead of flowing into expense liabilities and the possibility of conversion to equity. As of September 2019, C$514,999 is current and C$1,422,042 is long-term. There is C$152,526 in cash on hand.

The market's concern is headlined by ACB’s negative interest coverage ratio and a quick ratio of 0.63 (acid test ratio). I agree that the company is not perfectly positioned to cover all of its current liabilities which does represent a huge risk. But the tangible assets on the company’s balance sheet are being undervalued as a way to protect against a liquidity threat.

I view ACB has more of an industrial, capital intensive business. For instance, the PPE account grew more than 27% since last quarter to C$972,788 and intangible assets, items like dispensary licenses, permitting, and IP, totaled more than C$682,694, compared to a sales total of C$281,097 in FY2019. I calculated the capital intensity of the company by estimating the amount of assets to produce a dollar of sales, or total assets divided by sales. Every publicly traded company classified in the marijuana cultivation and distribution industries came in above market averages for capital intensity. This makes it more appropriate to use the asset coverage ratio (tangible and liquid assets – short-term debt)/total debt) as a way to think about default risk because it factors in the high cost of fixed assets, like equipment and licenses, necessary to make money in the industry.

Continuing the trend of being conservative, I removed ACB’s overvalued Goodwill and all non-marketable intangibles from the asset calculations. I added back the valuable and relatively liquid licenses and permitting assets. Tangible assets of C$1,751,099, permits and licenses of C$206,886, current debt of C$514,999, and total debt of C$1,422,042 are used. ACB’s asset coverage ratio is 1.13. Not amazing, but it’s above the peer set mean and tells the story of a company with the ability to cover its debt appropriately or at least be in a position of strength when negotiating covenants. Additionally, the company can still draw from a C$360 million credit facility and has access to a $400 million at-the-market equity program. I don’t understand why analysts are crowning ACB as the next financial disaster in the sector when in reality it’s a company relatively ready to deal with its debt.

While this doesn’t necessarily prove the stock will go up, I think it shows that analyst views that the stock is “going to zero” are overblown and putting huge downward pressure on the price. It’s a self-fulfilling cycle that may be misguided.

The company has already proven it’s willing to sell underperforming assets to maintain a sufficient cash balance. On January 6th, Aurora listed a greenhouse for sale for $17 million, one it acquired as a primary location in its acquisition of MedReleaf Corp. in 2018.

[https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/aurora-cannabis-lists-greenhouse-for-sale-in-move-that-implies-massive-writedowns-analyst](https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/aurora-cannabis-lists-greenhouse-for-sale-in-move-that-implies-massive-writedowns-analyst)

The market views this as a fire sale and a signal of write downs. That’s true, ACB is probably going to write down its acquisition of MedReleaf, and consequently, its Goodwill. There is a view in the market that ACB’s acquisition of MedReleaf in 2018 for $3.2 billion was one of the most overvalued in the industry’s recent history. The stock will go down if/when the company makes the announcement, but it doesn’t change the fundamentals of the business.

The company’s products are viewed as best in class and will continue to have increasing demand. ACB now owns some of the top brands in the field and a vertically integrated supply chain. With the roll out of Cannabis 2.0, ACB is well positioned to be a market leader through its edibles product line.",2020-01-16 18:16:46

As shown at the below link, I have found a possible buy verdict on American Eagle Outfitters:

The only question I have is about the geometric means of the growth metrics for past performance. These are all great for the latest annual report. Over the past ten years, however, they're not.

I saw the same phenomenon for WW, the only other company over the past 10 months of analysis, since finishing the BUS123W course, which has come close to passing through the framework. The market loved WW regardless and it's gone up 150+% since hitting the cheap price calculated according to the course framework, $17.24. So this makes me wonder if the market will ignore the long term geometric means for the 4 /FDS growth metrics for American Eagle also, and bid it up because of its great ROCE and, for the past year at least, great growth?

To address the concerns: Apple going up 34% on the 3 month chart and 13% on the monthly is not a huge concern for me mainly because of these gains are supported by the integration and expansion of  Apple's service revenue and wearables (airpods/watches) revenue as part of it's core investment strategy. I think it's a healthy move to diversify and branch out from the flagship iPhone revenue which generates some 60% of it's revenue. Apple looks to be staging a great foundation for the development of the service platform which aims to help provide an insurance for customers at a relatively reasonable price ( which I assume will become even more affordable and therefore, profitable as they scale this area). Numbers in last fiscal quarter also suggest a growing revenue share in this area. As per the wearables technology, the watches are becoming increasingly adapted to the active lifestyle market, which is an attractive combination of both technology and sports. I don't see a big competitor in this space as Apple has already established such a strong foundation in this product and the dominance of it's competitors are disproportionately favorable for Apple.

On second thought, the airpods are also a great technology that they can expand on. Recently there is some buzz on earphones as a health product, by integrating technology that can monitor heart rate and blood pressure through the ear canal via the airpods. This makes a great deal of sense as the skin is much thinner in the ear passageway compared to the wrist that the watch monitors off of. Would be really cool to see if they can work with something like this, and perhaps even integrate a voice recognition system and a translating software (like Google) to make the airpods more than just convenient, but highly accessible. 

I'd assume that ER will do commensurately better than the previous year, and we should be seeing some great numbers to support this growth. ALSO! integration of AMD technology into their new macbooks are going to be big for gamers and tech enthusiasts who have largely been accustomed to the Intel processors for ages. AMD is also a grow and developing company and their potential in unison with Apple can be a game changer for the software/high performance gaming market that Apple can also enter into.

So, after a Christmas break I thought a follow up was in order.

Its all great going ahead and getting a random selection of stocks, but how did it actually perform?

So, I checked out how it would have done when compared to the SPY, using a buy and hold strategy, for the entire time since the last post. Using a portfolio of 100k, it would have returned  if bought and sold at close.

[100k simultion](https://preview.redd.it/6hdj3riv3nb41.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a774a4b50b08402742684d2bc059881c6bbe61a)

So we got the price data for our stocks over the past few weeks since my last post. FRAN shit the bed, and there is a number of really poorly performing stocks in the lower quarter of the data.

The legend shows the stocked sorted by highest average return daily return.

Here are the raw results, I have included the proposed ratios and performance for 3 portfolios;

I haven't yet got around showing sentiment for the individual stocks yet. This should look pretty cool. If anyone has a better solution for time-series data, please let me know! I have been using yahoo finance, and its crap.

As suggested, I have added leverage.

For the time being, $BABA and $MSFT have culturally different clientele, providing a favorable moat to $MSFT in the US and with allies (UK, EU, AU, NZ) and the Western hemisphere neighborhood (LATAM). Of course, that's before we get to PaaS, which $MSFT serves as a leader in some of the most cutting edge (AI/ML, IoT), and as the uncontested king of on premise and hybrid cloud in enterprises.

&#x200B;

* **THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HATH SPOKEN:** Unless you're living under a rock, you've probably heard about JEDI and DEOS. The monopoly that $AMZN once enjoyed in the cleared space  is now in the crosshairs of \*\[the new\] big blue. This opens the door for Microsoft to gain all types of opportunities in the highly profitable federal space, and some of which it is uniquely positioned for with it's Azure Stack Hub and array of edge devices. Microsoft, with it's already deeply established sales and relationships with the DoD, will have no problems capitalizing on this opportunity. It's only just beginning. Microsoft can leverage a huge partner base, and don't forget that US defense companies can increase that leverage too.
   * Azure Stack Hub is a hybrid cloud platform by Microsoft that can be run fully disconnected and power containers (Kubernetes, Docker), other PaaS platforms (Pivotal CF, Red Hat OpenShift), and more. The solution has a multi-year head start in the availability in the marketplace, ahead of AWS competing solution Outpost - of which does not support fully disconnected scenarios.
* **O365, DYNAMICS, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB ARE EASY MONEY:** $MSFT is enjoying the fruits of its acquisition(al) labors on one hand, and the easiest inflows of cash via O365, which will see increased growth as more cleared / defense onboard into O365 and dog-whistle Teams.
* **ENJOYS THE TAILWINDS OF A RECORD YEAR**: $MSFT and Azure are coming along from record highs, with yearly gains between the 50-60% respectively. If you're bullish on the S&P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform. Microsoft has enjoyed steady climbs after most favorable earning events, provided its largely institutional (\~73%) ownership isn't panicking.
* **ADD per** u/ryryshouse6 **THE GREEN BUTTERFLY AFFECT:** As ETFs, funds, and retail investors will continue to gravitate toward environmentally-friendly companies, $MSFT serves as a very attractive Software Service option for managers to justify taking or increasing stakes with $MSFT. Microsoft already enjoys an overall ""Leader"" ESG score vs. Software industry according to MSCI ESG Research 2019 report, not taking into account the recent $1b investment to go carbon-negative by Microsoft.

Well i hope you all are ready for part 3.

CPU TALK

\--------

Most cpu/graphics drivers are in fact not optimized for Nvdia/Intel contrary to popular opinion.

$AMD has made the last 2 generations of APUs(ps3,ps4,, xbox1) for consoles and now they're making the next gen ones also.

Most games are developed for consoles and optimized to perform well on consoles because of their custom OS; they are able to have access to the lower level hardware more efficiently than say a general purpose os like linux/windows.

For comparison, the only other manufacturer able to do this is $Apple because they make both their own hardware and software so the devices they make operate really well and smooth.

So what im driving at here is that most games are devloped with $AMD hardware in mind because most games also release on consoles, there are very few PC exclusives.

AMD will use their place as an industry leader to also promote the desktop gaming environment. Zen3 CPUS(RYZEN 4000) has now been leaked showing another 30% performance improvement over Zen2(Ryzen 2000 and 3000 series) CPUs on a 7nm+ node. 

\--------

GPU TALK

\--------

I have speculated the big navi was coming early this year because 7nm nodes at TSMC($TSM) have now been shown to have above a 90% yield rate meaning for every 100 chip produced, 90 work. Samsung and Intel fabs have much lower yeilds. leaks show that Samsung 7nm is at 30% yeilds.([https://twitter.com/chiakokhua/status/1208385778486628353?s=20](https://twitter.com/chiakokhua/status/1208385778486628353?s=20))

Now we know for sure that big navi is coming and we are looking at more than 400mm\^2 die chips. The 5700xt die size is 252mm\^2; that means big navi has more than 2.5 times the die size as the 5700xt. Get ready for some serious performance out of AMD GPUs. Without yields being 90%+ on 7nm this would not be possible.

\--------------

FAB HOUSE TALK

\--------------

So now Apple, ARM, AMD, Nvidia, and now recently reveled Intel(for their dGPU - [https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-intel-second-generation-dg2-gpu-to-use-tsmcs-7nm-node/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app](https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-intel-second-generation-dg2-gpu-to-use-tsmcs-7nm-node/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)) are using $TSM's fab. TSM is fully booked for their 7nm process and now Apple is booking them for their 5nm node. AMD and TSM have a monopoly on their respective markets right now.

My hot take is $70+ for TSM([https://www.tradingview.com/x/PnNWs2oW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PnNWs2oW/)) and $80+ for AMD( [https://www.tradingview.com/x/2rdtOCur/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2rdtOCur/)) by 4/17/20.

Most of you retards spend your entire day looking at charts of the SPY and TSLA hoping it moves 5%.

This new Coronvirus has officially infected more than 200 people across multiple Chinese cities and also as far as Thailand, South Korea and Japan. 3 dead so far which have been heavily downplayed as they were over 60. Bro to bro transmission has just been confirmed.

China is likely suppressing these numbers, ICL puts the number of infected at more like 1700. If this is the true number we should start to see some real impact in behaviour and global fear. [ICL Report](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)

It's Chinese Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in their calendar to travel and see family, it's the perfect location and time for this to spread.

Travel Air China - weak already on this news, -4%

Anything to do with public area entertainment. Chinese Cinemas, theme parks etc etc.

Local Chinese Retail shops/centres.

Depending on spread / global traction these can move regionally to HK, Japan, etc.

BULLGANG 

Chinese healthcare - few of these local shares are already limit up 10%. Shandong Lukang Pharma, Shenzhen neptunas bio-engineering. 

Top pick: Shanghai Dragon corp: sick fucking stock name, also makes medical face masks and overalls. Unfortunately you can't buy unless you have a local account as there is no stock connect.

3M - global provider of face masks, speaking to local HK brokers these are already in high demand and hard to purchase. Also produces hand sanitizer.

Baba - people ain't gonna be buying shit outside are they.

RECKITT - 26% of revenues from china. Global producer of Dettol, hand sanitizer, all the cleaning stuff you have never used before. Also produces condoms & Lube - my models are predicting fucking to increase 63% YoY whilst everyone is stuck inside, posh wanks could also be primed to rise dramatically.

LAKE - hazmat suits including respiratory apparatus, \~30% revenues from China. Exactly what the Chinese bros are wearing whilst wheeling around these poor ill fuckers about. Its what you retards sent 5x over ebola.

Return on Assets is in the negative meaning the company loses money - which does not matter since the cashflow is still there, right?  Yes, but the cashflow is only there when there is money, right now money is flowing into Tesla, but investors are going to wake up soon.  Price/Earnings ratio is probably somewhere beyond 100 meaning the current stock price does not reflect the real value of the company (obviously).  People are soon going to realize that papa Musks company is a big troll, since they don't really have anything to offer except a few thousand poor quality e-cars - where other companies are catching up already.  The only thing they can offer is battery tech and the data they collected - but it is not worth as much as ppl think. 

**Shorting TSLA a good idea?**

No, definitely not.  I would even assume; the stock price will still go up based on all the stupid people and papa Musk still supplying capital to the company.  But in the long term it is a strongly overpriced stock (even technicals like the RSI are telling this) and sooner or later it is going to pop.

**Buying TSLA a good idea?**

Maybe, but maybe not.  The recent correction can indicate a trend reversal, or it is just a natural correction and the trend is going to continue.  But not a single technical instrument can tell for sure.   
 My guess would be, that the price is still going to go up, this is also based on a very strong resistance at the 500 line - the sellers have no momentum and were not able to break it when there was one.

**Conclusion**

No one can tell whether the stock is going up, down, sideways or in fu\*\*ing circles.  My suggestion is not to trade Tesla in any form and just watch the retards play.",2020-01-20 19:18:35

How this all pertains to US markets, I’m not quite sure... but if CNBC says that’s why the markets ~~kinda sorta not really~~ sold off, it’s gotta be true, right?

Anyway, I work with several Chinese nationals, and they said that this virus is breaking out because of the Chinese New Year that is coming up, and everyone is traveling over there right now. 

So to stamp out this type of outbreak, China takes your temperature at every train station and airport as well as any area where there is lots of foot traffic. If you’re running a fever you are isolated somewhere nearby in a holding room for 7 days to make sure you don’t infect people. If you fly into another region of China or return from another country you are sent home and your door is legit sealed off and you aren’t allowed out for 7 days. They do not fuck around over there and as you can imagine, don’t worry about invading people’s “privacy” when it comes to matters of health.

CNBC, MarketWatch, etc. are all warning that this virus could really “shock” the markets. I personally only see this slightly holding back the benchmarks broadly until everyone else realizes this is overblown (based on the progression of the outbreak so far).

If this virus really was part of why we closed red today, I don’t think we should worry about this long term.

SPCE has more than doubled in the past month and everyone is hype for it. Do you know why it's up? Speculation alone. Their operating income is $0 as they have never recorded a sale and their only profits from Q4 2018 to Q3 2019 came from issuance of common stock, more commonly known as dilution. 

&#x200B;

Now, the latest filings we have from SPCE are from November 12th, 2019 where their market cap was under $900 million and their stock price was just over $10. Now as we know their stock closed at almost $20 today, January 22nd, but their market cap has skyrocketed to over $3.8 billion. How has this happened? Dilution which means that the company is just pumping shares into the market. Per the November 12th filings SPCE had under 83 million shares outstanding, which includes insider shares and the float shares. Today though that amount is 196 million, which means they have more than doubled their total amount of shares on the market. Keep in mind that the only reliable guess of their cash balance is $0-$100 million, which is not nearly enough to really roll operations forward. If you're long for tendies be careful for the secondary offering to come out of nowhere and screw you hard. Best of luck betters.

$MMM makes masks that get sold in large numbers during wildfires and outbreaks, but might be too diversified to be affected too heavily.

A 2 to 5 percent mortality rate is quite high (normal flu is an order of magnitude or more below that). I wouldn't read too much into the patient profiles of the deceased yet; the fact that it has primarily affected 40 to 70 year olds to this point is to be expected (it's basically the demographic that frequents livestock markets). Unclear how the virus affects healthy/younger patients, but pneumonia doesn't need to kill to cause chronic problems.

If you were around for SARS last time around, you'd remember that fear of SARS meant that virtually everyone walking around Hong Kong, taiwan, etc. all had masks. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, mask sales added nearly $30M to $MMM's revenue in Q4 (of course, $MMM just made $31.97B in total revenue (ttm), so that's not the biggest dent).

Of note, my relatives are worried and starting to cancel flights to Asia in March and beyond. With new cases in Russia, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan (which China just blocked from the WHO conference), and the US, confirmed human to human transmission, and hundreds of millions about to travel and congregate in large groups for the lunar new year (China estimates 3 billion trips), this should take a few months to play out (SARS went for months, and everyone wore masks for at least a year).

DD,SPY Puts,16,esit41,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esit41/spy_puts/,28,1579758458.0,"Ok, I know what you’re thinking: It’s a scummy bear, one of those people who wants me to lose money and for the world to end.

This is not the case. I’m actually bullish on the market and my year end price target for $SPY is 340.

However, we have come up too far, too fast. Since October 8th, $SPY is up 15% despite earnings growth this quarter being negative. 

PEG and PE ratios, despite being a stereotype statistic for bears, does have powerful predictive powers over the market and these ratios are reaching highs not seen in years.

The average RSI reading for the past three months is 68, whereas 70 represents extremely overbought levels. Usually 70 is a level only achieved for short periods of time at a rallies peak, but we have held this metric for months. 

Company earnings are up 1% since the start of 2019 while the market, even if measured at the most favorable point of the 2018 peak is still up 12%.

While I believe this year will be a positive one, we have come into this year with far too much momentum and I think today’s intraday trading pattern exemplifies that we are starting to slow down and turn the other way. We were at a 0.5% gain and trading strongly before investors started to sell throughout the day and into the close. This strongly contrasts with what has become the recent norm, trading up through the day and at least up into the close.

This leads me to how I’m trading this.

I believe the market will decline at least 5% within the next month, so I modeled my options positions to be nicely profitable in those conditions.

Firstly, I took positions in the VXX Feb 21 16 Call, which is currently trading for $40. If the market drops 5%, VXX (which currently trades at 13.55) would hit 19.10, representing a 775% return for the option which would effectively trade at $310. I modeled this price for the VXX based off the decline in August of last year.

Secondly, I took positions in the SPY Feb 21 325 Put. This option currently trades for $230. SPY currently trades at 331.31. If the market dropped 5%, the option would be worth $1,025, representing a 445% return.

Essentially, the combined profit (after subtracting your initial investment) would be $1,065 with a risk of $270, or a nearly 400% profit off of a completely reasonable drop of 5%. No one made a big deal about this when it happened in August, as these things are normal.

And I don’t want to inspire greed, but that’s if the market drops just 5%. If the market were to drop like it did in February 2018, your profit would ballon to nearly 1,100% of your initial investment.

I have about 7.5% of my portfolio invested in these options, and almost want to YOLO my entire account and see what happens. I’m sixteen years old, so I could probably make the money back, yeah?",2020-01-23 00:47:38

PKE is an aerospace materials company serving the esoteric end of the space and aerospace industry. It is a supplier to a number of aerospace and space-sector companies like KRATOS, LMT, MRAS, NOC, NASA, AJRD, BA just to name a few. The company is small with a market cap of 350 million but has paid big special dividends in the past and insider ownership seems to favor such shareholder distributions. I believe this company is highly undervalued and could sell for 1 Billion easy based on compacity and future contracts. PKE is both a growth company and dividend giant the earnings look strong and the balance sheet is clean 144 million in cash no debt. It is currently expanding the manufacturing facility in Wichita, Kansas. The facility expansion positions PKE to grow within its existing business. While PKE is actively seeking M&A candidates stated by CEO at Nedham Growth Conference January 15 2020. PKE indicated that it is interested in expanding in ASIA but does not know how to enter that market by itself. The M&A has not yielded any results but PKE will be patient and disciplined.

I picked up 10 contracts of the $340/60 strikes at market open and so far the return is phenomenal, but that's besides the point.

I punched out the numbers and found that Netflex subscriber growth hasn't moved much at all with the integration of competitive platforms via ESPN+, Disney, Apple TV, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc. This makes a lot of sense because much of the aforementioned platforms are only going to last several month to a year and expire without resubsciption. This is mainly speculative, but many of these services are actually paired with purchases of new cellphone plans and product purchases (i.e. Free Disney with Apple iPhone 11 purchase, Free Amazon Prime Video for Amazon Prime (making the video segment a non-factor), Hulu with it's year long $1.99 p/m subscription deal offered last Christmas, and ESPN+ which is mainly tailored for sports and no longer offers any viable content since pay-per view is always going to be an added cost). 

On the topic of cashflow, which is huge for Netflix and a primary driver of it's devaluation. In Q1 ER, they burned through $1.7B, and the expected for the rest of the year is going to be around $2.5. They said 2019 was the biggest cash burn year to get the platform on track by increase content value, ease of access, marketing, etc. Seems to me Netflix is making the adjustments to go cash flow positive. 

On fundamentals, a rising wedge is forming very healthily. But who cares about fundamentals lol.

This company has spent 15 years doing jackshit - literally they have 1 plane. You know whose moved faster than these guys?

* SpaceX (founded 2002) landed rockets on goddamn boats
* Facebook (founded 2004) figured out how to destroy democracy
* THE ENTIRE SMARTPHONE INDUSTRY STARTED 3 YEARS LATER
* America elected both a non-white person AND a reality TV star as president.

For crying out loud, a new Half Life is landing before these guys actually launch their service.

My point here is that this team has literally shat the bed for 15 years, I'm not sure what makes you think now of all times they're magically going to get their act together.

But maybe you believe that the revenue opportunity is massive - and they're just on the cusp of raking in all that cash.

*  SPCE has disclosed that they have ONE working plane. They have another that maybe they'll have by some time next year. They plan for 5 by 2023.
* They have plans for hypersonic travel - but thats more than 5 years out.
* At max they have 5 people flying per flight. They only make profit after the 2nd one, so you can back into at least how many flights they can have with their current list of 600. And any partially filled flights are going to drag on their margin.
* Also any unexpected maintenance really fucks with earnings when you have ONLY ONE PLANE.

BUT here's the rub - the really interesting bit is that they had to go through this SPAC process because they were running out of cash, and Richard Branson was tired of throwing his own money into a pit. What's crazy here is that instead of doing normal things (raising capital through an IPO, doing a round with any of the massive VC firms that clearly love pissing away money, raising debt, or looking for to be acquired) they opted for essentially a direct listing.

Why do it this way?

1. They probably couldn't raise the money (let that sink in - WeWork was probably a more convincing business model than this shit)
2. No one wanted to buy their IP (likely because its super nascent and all the decent engineering companies thought it was not worth the amount Richard Branson spent)
3. The easiest people to feed this garbage to are retail investors too dumb to do research.

AND LASTLY: Go to their fucking website. They're shilling Microsoft Edge. Any company that proudly boasts how deeply they've partnered with Edge does not instill any confidence in their technical prowess.

However, Intel's and IBM's earnings report gave us a glimpse into the future to confirm how well Microsoft will perform. 

We know that Microsoft is developing several new data centers, as their cloud computing platform continues to grow faster than AWS. Intel confirms these growths are larger than expected. 

> Revenue from the company’s Data Center Group, which makes chips for computer servers, was up about 19% at $7.21 billion, more than the $6.40 billion FactSet analyst consensus.

IBM also confirmed a large growth in cloud computing.

> IBM CFO: Q4 results driven by acceleration of hybrid cloud portfolio.

This was the best single day gain IBM has seen in a decade.

There is a huge surge in new Windows purchases as well.

> In the first half of the year Intel will be able to sell chips as people upgrade to Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system — Microsoft’s support for Windows 7 ended earlier this month — and that factor will taper off in the second half, Swan said.

In addition to this, Microsoft Teams is growing faster than Slack, and their Office 365 special edition ran out of stock (limited subscription).

I expect most of their growth to be based on cloud computing, they their software sales should be excellent too.

“We think Intel is benefiting from an improving macroeconomic climate versus company-specific improvements at this time,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves, who rates Intel’s stock at underperform but took his price target up to $56 from $48. If his thesis is correct, Steves said Intel would simply be riding a “rising tide” that’s lifting all data-center competitors, and he expects rivals Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.12%  and AMD to keep outperforming Intel by picking up share.”

When Micron reported earnings in December they announced the bottom of the semiconductor market. And, they believe with their recent expansion in sales that the market it finally turning up due to 5G. With 5G more things are going to go into the cloud than we have now and new businesses will be born from this. You need data centers to power this. Micron makes the drives to hold the data for the data centers. AMD and Intel make the CPUs to process the data. 

Intel reported 1 billion in growth from the cycle turning out. Analysts are shrugging their shoulders because the conference call said they will experience a down turn in the second half, which is strange for a company that just beat by 1 billion. The banks grilled Intel about this and they answered that it is due to competition and they made their numbers “conservative.”

AMD has released beefy 64 core processors so much cheaper than Intel and on 7nm technology, which Intel said won’t have until 2021. This is why AWS and Azure and even Google Cloud are buying so many of these processors. They get better margins for their investors and they get better efficiency. If the whole market is going up AMD has the most to gain because of this.

DD,Target Financial Analysis Strengths/Weaknesses,22,eu0s12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eu0s12/target_financial_analysis_strengthsweaknesses/,19,1580034771.0,"First attempt at thoroughly researching a company's finances. Wish I could I could attatch the spreadsheets I made which more clearly display the financial ratios of Target and its main competitors (Costco & Walmart). I am by no way an expert, and any constructive criticism is valued, especially if there is something I failed to miss or fundamentally don't understand.

&#x200B;

**Strengths**

* Target has a higher **gross margin** (26.32%) than its peers (Costco: 12.98%, Walmart: 25.10%). This means that the company retains more capital on each dollar of sales, which can be used to pay other costs or satisfy debt obligations.
* Target has an **operating margin** of 5.58%, meaning that each dollar earned in revenue brings 5.58 cents in profit. Because its operating margin is higher than its competitors (Costco: 3.16%, Walmart: 4.50%), the company a has a greater proportion of revenue available to cover non-operating expenses like paying interest.
* Target has a **net profit margin** of 3.89%, the highest of its main competitors (Costco: 2.40%, Walmart: 1.30%). A net profit margin of 3.89% means that for every dollar generated by Target in sales, the company kept about 4 cents in profit. Retailers tend to have profit margins that are lower than in other sectors, which can run between 0.5% and 3.5%.
* Target’s **price-to-earnings ratio** of 20.01 is relatively lower than its peers (Costco: 35.53, Walmart: 23.20) which suggests the stock is potentially undervalued among its main competitors.
* Target has the lowest **price-to-book ratio** (3.26) among its competitors (Costco: 8.50, Walmart: 3.80) which suggests its stock is undervalued. However, this alone shouldn’t be used to assess whether a stock is undervalued. It’s useful to consider the P/B ratio with the company’s ROE, as they both factor in the book value of equity. Because Target has a relatively low P/B ratio and a relatively high **return on equity** (25.47%), the company’s stock is likely undervalued.
* Target’s **price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio** of (2.48) is lower than its peers (Costco: 4.49, Walmart: 2.48), suggesting its stocks is more undervalued than its competitors.
* Target’s **price-to-sales ratio** of (0.50) is lower than its peers (Costco: 0.85, Walmart: 0.55) which suggests its stock is more undervalued than its competitors. Furthermore, when complementing the company’s low P/S ratio with its high **net profit margin** (3.89%), the same conclusion can be made.
* Target’s **price-to-cash-flow ratio** of (6.35) is lower than its competitors (Costco: 20.54, Walmart: 10.17). Although there is no single figure that points to an optimal P/CF ratio, a ratio in the low single digits may indicate the stock is undervalued
* Target’s relative low **enterprise value to EBITDA** of 11.25 (Costco: 20.06, Walmart: 11.37) indicates that the company may be undervalued

&#x200B;

**Good, but Not the Best**

* Target has an **interest coverage ratio** of 9.15, meaning it has around nine times as much in EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) as in debt interest. Although Target is more than able to cover their interest expense with their earnings, the company has the lowest interest coverage ratio among its top competitors (Costco: 32.15, Walmart: 9.67). 
* Target’s **return on assets** (7.30%) is between its competitors (Costco: 8.49%, Walmart: 3.15%). Every dollar that Target has invested in assets generates 7.3 cents of net income, Costco 8.49 cents and Walmart 3.15 cents. This means that Target is better at converting its investments into profits compared with Walmart but not as good as Costco.
* Target’s **return on equity** of 25.47% is significantly higher than Walmart’s return on equity of 8.87% but slightly less than Costco’s return on equity of 26.10%. A return on equity of 25.47% implies $0.25 returned on every $1 invested. Target’s relatively high return on equity suggests the company efficiently uses its stockholders’ equity to earn profits.
* Target’s **earnings per share** of 5.56 is between Costco’s (8.32) and Walmart’s (2.28). With a higher earnings per share, we can assume that Target is performing better than Walmart in terms of profitability. This is also reflected in the gross profit margin and net profit margin 

  

**Weaknesses**

* Target has the lowest **quick ratio** (0.20) among its peers, with Costco’s and Walmart’s quick ratios being 0.52 and 0.23, respectively. With a quick ratio under one, the company does not have adequate current assets to cover short-term obligations. However, this is not a significant issue, as the retail sector has traditionally had a very low quick ratio. Companies leading the retail sector typically negotiate favorable credit terms with suppliers due to their dominance over the market.
* Target’s **receivables turnover ratio** of 74.28 is much lower compared to its competitors (Costco: 95.32, Walmart: 86.48), indicating that the company’s collection of accounts receivables is inefficient, and that the company has a high proportion of customers that are either not financially viable or creditworthy. Whereas it takes a around four days for Costco and Walmart to collect its accounts receivables, it takes Target about five days to do so. 
* Target has a significantly lower **inventory turnover ratio** (5.90) than its peers (Costco: 11.80, Walmart: 8.80) which means the company is selling goods at a slower pace and there is less demand for the company’s products. It takes Target approximately 62 days to sell its inventory on hand while it takes Costco about 31 days and Walmart about 41 days.
* Target’s **asset turnover ratio** of 1.88 is lower than its competitors (Costco: 3.54, Walmart: 2.43), signaling the company is not efficiently using its assets to generate sales. For every dollar in assets, Target generated $1.88 in sales, while Costco and Walmart generated $3.54 and $2.43, respectively. Target’s low turnover may indicate that the company is experiencing sluggish sales or obsolete inventory. Furthermore, its low inventory may also mean the company the company has lax collection methods.

**The Bottom Line:**  In comparison to its peers, Target Corp. struggles to effectively use its assets and manage its liabilities in the short-term. The company’s collection of accounts receivables is inefficient, likely a result of lax collection methods, it sells goods at a slow pace, possibly due to less demand for its products, and the company may be holding obsolete inventory. With regards to liquidity, Target and its top competitors all have a quick ratio of less than one which would indicate that the businesses are not able to meet short-term obligations. However, this is not an issue, as large-cap retailers typically negotiate favorable credit terms with suppliers due to their dominance over the market. The company outshines its competitors in terms of profit-generating abilities. Target retains a great deal of capital on each dollar of sales, it has a large proportion of revenue available to cover non-operating expenses, and it keeps a considerable amount profit for every sale it generates after accounting for all expenses, costs, and cash flow items. Although not up to par with Costco, Target is better able to convert its assets and stockholders’ equity into profits than Walmart. Finally, when examining the company’s market prospect ratios, Target appears to be undervalued when considering its low market value ratios (P/E, P/B, PEG, P/S, EV/EBITDA). 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Overall Costco seems to be the best business to invest in with Target being a close second. That said, right now Target looks relatively undervalued in comparison to both companies.",2020-01-26 05:32:51

Anyways, let's ignore all that.

And, now let's look at the [CPC numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak#Phylogenetics) and assume its correct (i.e. best case scenario):

The **result is that we have 2,978,758 people infected, and 89,363 people dead (3% death rate based on CPC figures)** after 19 days.

But hey, maybe the growth rate in that period wasn't accurate.

Let's take the average growth rate of all 11 days.

The **result is that we have 5,926,898 people infected, and 177,807 people dead (3% death rate based on CPC figures)** after 19 days.

If we take the ""Total Infected"" in China which is reportedly around [1975](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-latest-updates/2020/01/26/4603266c-3fa8-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html), That means on average we're getting around 103 patients per hospital. You're joking right? Here's a [link](http://www.rmhospital.com/896/8963.aspx) to just ONE of the hospitals in Wuhan. For this one singular hospital, the google translate is telling me there are 1,200 beds available. BUT ALL THE HOSPITALS IN WUHAN ARE OVERCAPACITY? The doctors and nurses are all [freaking out](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/etpveg/chinese_doctor_in_the_city_of_wuhan_in_tears/) about how there's no room apparently. So you're telling me one hospital has a 1200 person capacity, its over filled, there are 17-18 more hospitals in the city center, and there are only 1975 people infected? Even accounting for other diseases, that is still a huge margin to cover from 1975 people.
3. \[Further Evidence\] Apparently, we don't know if this is true or not, but a nurse/doctor in Wuhan just posted a video claiming 90,000 people are infected. She says there is about a 1:14 ratio where if one person is infected, 14 more will get infected on average. Here's the [video](https://twitter.com/terrence_str/status/1221100970521829377?s=21). 90,000 people would fit the number of hospitals in Wuhan much more. In fact too much. If we're assuming an average 750 bed capacity for all the hospitals in the city center, that would be about 14750 bed capacity for hospitals in the city center. There are other hospitals in the vicinity of the city as well so that would be maybe 3x more if we go on all sides. That's around 50000. She is claiming 90,000 (btw we don't know where she got that number from, but it makes more sense), which is much more than the government reported number, but it make a lot more sense than 1975.

So basically that's why I think this might be much worse than anticipated. Let me know what you think or if you have further evidence to present.

NIO has the opportunity to stand on the shoulder of a giant and do what Tesla has done, but do it better. Let me list off a few points of what's made me bullish as fuck on them:

- Gone from concept to mass production faster than Tesla
- CEO and founder William Li believes they will turn a profit faster than Tesla
- Has NIO Formula E Team, a professional European sports car racing team that has set multiple records at world-reknown racetracks
- Backed by the Chinese fucking government
- First production car to have an interactive proprietary artificial intelligence, NOMI
- Has their own clothing collection, NIO Life
- Fucking in-seat massagers
- 5 minute battery swap stations
- NIO house, a showroom on the first floor with 3 more floors of community center space, look it up!
- 200 planned NIO House/NIO Space showroom openings in 2020
- Developed a driverless car while waiting for driverless tech
- Can literally use Tesla's shared IP to get a competitive edge 
- Shared environmental preservation sentiment as Tesla, their name in Chinese literally means Blue Sky Ahead 
- NIO Service, can charge your car/swap the battery for you while you sleep if your home does not have a charging station
- Cheap as fuck right now because people think they're going to run out of money

They're about to be even more heavily discounted over the next few weeks due to some hick ass bat soup disease. Gettin my money ready to wade deeper into the communist waters of China. You should to! Imagine being able to get into Tesla when it was this cheap. 

Tesla is more than a car company you say? So will NIO be I believe. They, like China, have a far future in mind. They're looking to the horizon while others are looking at today. It's a company I have come to love and will stand by.

Godspeed retards.

***What to do right now***

If you own any Chinese stock, get out of your position right now. If you have any calls that expire within the next few weeks, I would strongly advise you exit those as well. Protect yourself from further losses immediately. 

***What to watch for***

Keep your eyes and ears peeled for the apex of viral infection. When numbers of infected peak and level off, you may want to consider getting back into the market. 

***What to buy right now***

Right now buying puts on most individual Chinese stocks and indexes should prove to be fruitful. Better to get them now rather than later.

***What to buy later***

Any stock that was heavily depressed by the news, that you believe is undervalued and will rebound quickly. You may want to also keep an eye on American companies that manufacture in China. If this goes on longer than a week, their production lines will be affected and they will be ripe for buying opportunities later as well.

Some of my favorite stocks at the moment are Chinese. The big three I am most interested in are Luckin' Coffee, NIO and Alibaba. All are in and will continue to be driven into bargain territory this week due to the extended Chinese New Years Holiday and likely even further beyond that.

***What's the buy point***

This is hugely speculative, but here are my predictions on the best buying points for my three mentioned stocks above:

LK:

Attractive: $30,
Get In Now: $20,
Must Buy: $18 and below

NIO:

Attractive: $3,
Buy Now: $2.50,
Throw Your Money At It: $2 and below

BABA:

Attractive: $200,
Buy Now: $160,
Mortgage your home: $135 and below

***What does all of this mean***

It means you have the buying opportunity of the year or possibly even years in these stocks. As long as the virus doesnt kill off too many people, the Chinese economy will bounce back even stronger and your profits will swell along with it. 

***Final Thoughts***

Keep your cool and focus on profiting in these market conditions. Many opportunities are presenting themselves, have the calm sense to realize what they are. I have already eaten losses myself. If you have too, pick yourselves up, pat yourself on the back and get your ass back in the game

Best of luck to all my WSBros and well-wishes to all those who are suffering in China from the direct and indirect effects of the coronavirus.

Edit: formatting, added tl;dr

TL;DR - Exit chinese market immediately, buy after viral apex, profit

Edit: FXI puts also a great idea!

I honestly don’t think we are equipped half as well as China is to deal with an outbreak in Chicago or another major metropolitan area.

How long will trading rest on coronavirus news? It’s simple math: the 2 week incubation period minus the attention span of the average bull tells us this news should blow over by Wednesday. TBH the virus will probably not be resolved and contained for another month, but that doesn’t mean we won’t start trading up on “virus talks going well”.


Anyway, some updates on the happenings in China that remind me to btfd:

Almost every city is under quarantine with cities having giant trenches dug around the city to prevent traffic in addition to gates/walls going up to prevent foot traffic.

In other parts of the country vehicles are constantly being hit with disinfectant sprays (like a car wash).

China is insanely efficient. They have pulled doctors from all over the country to fight this. I truly believe they have this under control within their own borders, but the problem ultimately rests with us and other countries that have seen patients show up.

I will mention however, one of my coworkers from the mainland said that the Wuhan region is surrounded by forested areas and thus lots of wild animals etc. and that after SARS in 2003 they predicted the next outbreak would be from that area because of this. Well here we are. He also said “in some of the southern areas of China they eat everything that flies except the plane, and everything on the ground except the train”. So you can imagine how easy it is for outbreaks like this to occur. Not great to hear...

I actually work in the Aerospace industry (I know people that have worked for VG), and I would stay away from investing in them. VG was formed from a one-shot vehicle that was designed to win the X-prize in 2004 by going into space. The haven't reached space (100km) since then.

Also, reports on the 2014 crash that killed a pilot indicate that they have a serious problem with their engineering culture. Most of the engineering talent came from Scaled Composites, where they would design prototypes or demo vehicles. Apparently this engineering mindset of prototype design has followed through to their production vehicles, where they will find and solve problems *as they come up*, rather than having detailed procedures for testing and troubleshooting.

Given the fact that SpaceShipTwo has been in development for well over a decade with still no paying customers flying (the first flights have been months away for a decade now), it's pretty hard to believe that they'll develop an *orbital* launch platform anytime soon, especially considering there are similar launch vehicles for similar prices already.",2020-01-27 19:58:36

But predicting the psychology of the mob, is sometimes much easier. The introduction of coronavirus into the most bullish stock market and economy of all time presents an interesting opportunity where I feel that we can predict a market downturn as well as the timing of said downturn, with just a little old fashioned psychology, and publicly available facts.



#Predicting the future is hard

I do not know how many people will die from Coronavirus. I do not know the eventual death rate. I do not know the probability of a full scale pandemic. Neither does anybody else, really. So this point does not stand against me. 

#Predicting the mob is easy.

People read the news, still. This news seeps into their mind and subtly changes the way their fingers interact with their big swinging hedge fund dicks, and Robinhood portfolios. Hedge fund managers definitely still read the news, even if you autists don't. What's my point? The news media is wildly misrepresenting the current situation with the Coronavirus. Dipshit journalists will cite things like ""the flu infects more people than corona"" or ""death rate of only 3%"" as if these are not wildly naive statistical calculations. What's my point? When corona has infected more people than SARS(should be the case in just 2-3 days), you will see very panicky headlines stating that fact. When the US shuts all travel to China, journalists will likewise create a broad sense of panic. People will take to social media and become aware of the scale. This will create an atmosphere of panic. When the virus starts to slow down, and things are actually getting better, in a twist of irony, the sample mortality rate will creep up. This is a basic statistical fact -- as the growth remains high, the mortality rate will be understated as the population is predominated by relatively more healthy recently infected persons, and as the growth rate slows, the mortality rate will approach reality. 

As these facts become more widely known, optimism will turn to panic. Future surprises with Coronavirus to be negative! That is the nature of this kind of thing. Dr. Taleb has done some great work on this subject which I recommend.

#Coronavirus will have some impact on S&P 500. 

The fed is pumping money to all time highs. We are in the most bullish stock market of all time. All we need is a little fear, and the change in animal spirits will be self-reinforcing. The economy is slowing despite the roaring stock market. In addition we have the real economic impact of shutting down large parts of China, cancelling travel between countries, etc. Even a small change to absolute GDP can mean a  relatively significant change to a quarterly growth rate figure, which is what moves the markets.

#Will Coronavirus spread to Europe and the USA in a significant way?

I hope not. I don't think my thesis depends on it. I'm not here to fearmonger. However, I absolutely recommend taking minor medical precautions with some awareness that this is a possibility. For instance, if you are a gross person who does not wash their hands, maybe now is the time to learn. (don't sell your 401ks people!!)

#What is the timing of these puts?

Seeing as how the virus has to slow down in the next 40 days or infection rates will be higher than the entire world population, you are safe with puts that far out. I am going a little earlier, because I feel that surpassing SARS will be a critical psychological point. What strike? Fuck if I know. Go with something that's not too hot, not too cold, just right. The baby bear amount. (whose name has been unrightfully stolen by that human bitch Goldilocks who steals from innocent bears!!)

DD,My top picks for February to June,19,ev9ioz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev9ioz/my_top_picks_for_february_to_june/,20,1580265640.0,"AAPL - Will not disappoint with ER or guidance. Coronavirus will have nominal impact on the operations and manufacturing end in China because the government has placed heavy sanctions against intercity and intra-city travel. Containment is in full effect now and biotechs are currently racing for a vaccine. This will likely improve relations between China and the U.S and Trump has extended a hand to help the Chinese. Double the win. Let's not forget their service-side and wearables department expanding at an unprecedented rate.

PYPL - I love this one a lot. Paypal's integration into China's Union Pay is massively undervalued. The potential for both parties is extremely important. The exchange of data across the two platforms will be valuable for advertisers and the retail industry to tap into consumer appetites and trends. For those that don't know, Union Pay is the largest Chinese financial services company. Works much like a bank and is offered as a form of payment at many destinations across the U.S. However, there are fees associated and they are not made available for online retailers in the U.S. That being said, Paypal fills this gap very nicely. The Chinese, known for their appetite for purchasing American products and brands are going to rave all over the ability to access Paypal and American online retailers. The only thing left to do for them is to partner/buyout a logistics company that will set up the right network for them to ship goods into China.

SBUX - Said it before and will say it again, I took profits from my early January buys and rolled them into safer $88/90/92.5 Calls. Currently sitting at a very small profit but I have a month out for some and 2 months for the others. It's been a pretty hectic week for this ticker because of the Coronavirus fears which will likely impact their sales in China because the 4,000 locations they have in China are going to account for a maximum of a quarter loss in revenue (only if they literally do not get any sales at all). But all that aside, I think this stock is positioned well for growth with their monopolization of the domestic market and their growing marketshare of the Chinese/global markets. Can't wait to see an outpouring of support for this stock soon. Rock on!

But Tesla is going to be an exception this year for the auto industry.

After coronavirus, we should see people frantically trying to buy cars because they don't want to take subways. People don't want to be in enclosed areas with thousands of other people. This fear will continue even after the virus is contained. They still need to get around though, and that's where cars come in. 

Problem is that having petrol cars, especially in major cities, comes with large costs that put off people from buying one. EV cars get around a lot of these costs. The biggest incentive is license plate quotas. In Shanghai and Beijing, license plates are on a lottery system and the cost can be almost as much as the car itself. Millions of people will want a car RIGHT NOW, they don't want to wait year after year to win the lotto and get a plate. They don't trust subways and buses, they are scared for the next epidemic, and they want a car as soon as possible. So what do they do?

# They buy an EV.

Tesla is ahead of all other EV companies, even the ones in China. They've undercut NIO, their products are superior to products from BYD, and many of the models by Chinese car companies are built like compliance cars. The XPeng P7 may be able to compete on cost and value, but they don't have the capacity to supply cars to the millions of customers who want an EV this year. 

Tesla has the supercharger network that they are ramping up this year in China. This is a huge advantage over other companies, because a Tesla owner can use both the supercharger network and the current charging network built by the government and third parties. Most people in China live in apartments, with limited access to charging at home so charging infrastructure matters more than most places.

Tesla will be building its own batteries. They don't have to worry about battery constraints as the other competitors do. They're going to be able to bring down the price of the most expensive part of an EV lower than their competitors can acquire, and it's going to get even lower. As scale of production ramps up, Tesla can increase its marginal revenue holding prices constant, because the cost of each Tesla they produce is going down. Labour costs are also cheaper in China. The more China slows down, the slower cost of labour goes up.

The price is right. $46,000 USD seems high, but millions of people in China spend that much just to buy a regular petrol car along with the price of the license plate. Large families (most likely to buy a car because they don't want their kids getting kung flu from the subway) pool their money for large purchases, enabling them to buy houses and cars without financing. 

Out of all EV car companies, Tesla will be the one on top.",2020-01-28 20:19:41

DD,Health Insurance Tendies,20,ev5i5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ev5i5c/health_insurance_tendies/,10,1580246358.0,"Guys, get your damn UNH puts. I'll tell you why:

Without a doubt, UNH will be a very busy company over the coming 2-6 weeks. This isn't a good thing, though.

As I'm sure you all know, UNH is a health insurance provider. These guys make their money when somebody is insured by them, and doesn't have any reason whatsoever to see a doctor. Their ideal client is someone who pays premium and never gets sick. Their ideal quarter is one in which every hospital in the country is empty. Their ideal country is one in which everyone has to pay for the service UNH provides, but never actually uses it. They make the most when they have to do nothing at all.

UNH is Theta gang, who sells premium against disease.

Whether you think that the Wuhan Flu is an actual issue or not, one thing is certain: people are frightened by it. Although most times people just ""shrug off"" cold like symptoms, with the recent sensationalist headlines, there will be an unexpectedly high amount of clinic/ER visits for silly little runny noses and other bullshit. Although these won't be bonafide Wuhan Flu cases, UNH will still have to pay out for the MD/hospital services rendered. If WuFlu actually DOES end up being something... just look up the daily cost of an ICU visit to get an idea of the claims payouts UNH might be looking at (**HINT**: It's about a cyber truck per week).

Furthermore, it's looking like there is a growing threat to UNH's very market niche. There is rising fear and uncertainty in the market that there will even be a **role** for UNH if Bernie implements universal health care. Whether you think public health care is a good idea or not, and whether you think Bernie might/should be president, it's clear that there is a growing possibility that American health care may join the rest of the developed world with a public health system. If this happens, would UNH even have a product to sell?

If health care goes public, UNH and others will be left with nothing other than their dicks in their hands. Their sole product will become obsolete. Imagine being a horse shoe salesman when Henry Ford popularized the car. Imagine being a slide rule manufacturer at the advent of the personal computer. Despite currently having a $30B market cap, UNH could possibly be left with the same valuation as $LEH.

UNH is theta gang, during the world's largest health care scare in over 15 years. They're Abacus Inc., just as a new calculator shop is opening up down the street. Yet somehow, they're trading at just about 5% below ATH, and near the top of their 52wk range.

I just wanted to hear from people who are thinking SHOP will beat or what you think will happen on earnings. (Feb 12th before market open)

The specifics of my logic is based on the fact that Q4 growth seems to be slowing about 16.5% every year with the last 3 years being 85% (2016), 71% (2017), and 54% (2018). I think its realistic to think we would actually see a growth of around 44% which would translate into roughly $470M which is below the estimates range of revenue which is 475.45M - 493.14M.

* Only patients with Wuhan travel history and symptoms are tested.  
* Incubation period is around one week, after that weakest die around one week since showing symptoms.

So theoretically there a lot of ramen virus carriers in the U.S. who are incubating, transmitting and some of them already starting to show mild symptoms, but they think it is regular flu and they are not tested because they don’t have any connection to China. Tests are expensive, they are not performed on all patients showing flu-like symptoms.  

Current timeline:  
China has detected new virus mid-December,  then closed bat soup market on Jan 1st when they had 41 confirmed case, then got first death on Jan 10th.  
U.S. got first patient confirmed by test on Jan 21st.  
On Jan 29 we had 5 confirmed patients with symptoms - that is similar to situation in China mid-December.  

Prediction:  
If we apply direct approximation, around Feb 14th U.S. should have 40 lab-confirmed patients, then around February 25th U.S. will have first death due to Wuhan virus.  
Mid-March U.S. might have 100 fatalities when government enacts quarantine of L.A. area with Cybertrucks blocking all roads in and out.

Here's a series post about making some serious cash. 

***What's Happening?***

The Wu-flu epidemic is far from cresting. The Chinese markets are closed and will be closed through Monday. The reason the markets are closed for this extended period of time is to avoid market volatility and prevent the Chinese market from crashing.

What is happening is the opposite, at least where volatility is concerned. It is building up and will pop when and if the markets open this coming Monday.

I am encouraging everyone to get in on this. Even if it's a small pop, it will be a pop. If it's a big one, then we clean up and everyone has a good day except the artistic inverters.

***What's The Play?***

Buy puts on FXI. That's the play. Play it how you like it. I'm already in and waiting to hopefully make some nice tendies come Monday. I would consider buying them a little bit out in the case that the Market gets an even further delayed opening.

Credit to u/Leaky_Buns for the play. He's been saying it all over the sub for the past few days and I think he is correct.

***Where's The Proof?***

*Taiwan and Hong Kong Markets Take a Hit*

The Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets both opened this week to about -6% and -3% respectively after their return from the lunar holidays.

They are both continuing to drop. They are heavily reliant on the Chinese economy and should be a good indicator of what will happen once Chinese markets open. 

*Increased Infection Rate*

There's also the fact that the rate of infection is not slowing. Look at this graph from Johns Hopkins University and you'll see the number of reported infections has been increasing exponentially and will likely continue to do so.

*Businesses Staying Closed*

> Hubei authorities announced late Wednesday that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 13.**

> This week, Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang announced that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 9.**

Excerpt taken from the CNBC Live Updates page linked below.

*Viral Infection Not Contained*

> ""But the disease has spread far and wide inside China and, with extensive worldwide travel by its citizens, especially during the celebration of the Lunar New Year""

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html

*Months Until Vaccination Trials Begin*

> Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the N.I.H., who oversees Dr. Graham’s team, said he expected the vaccine research to move quickly.

> “If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, which will be record speed,” he said, referring to early human trials that test for safety.

> With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months from the release of the viral genome to get a vaccine ready for human trials. By the time an epidemic caused by the Zika virus occurred in 2015, researchers had brought the timeline down to six months. Now, they hope the joint efforts will cut that time in half.

The virus is not under control.

***Interactive Virus Map from Johns Hopkins University***

This is a handy tool to use to track the viral data on a cool interactive map. It is sometimes a few hours behind, but you can get a near perfect sense of the aggregated medical data available.

Nestle already owns 19% of the shares and there's a huge chance that they'll buy them out.  Estimates would be at about $60 a share for the buyout, and at prices currently $32.38, there's a ton of money to be made.  The FDA advisory board voted 7-2 in favor of the drug, and while that doesn't mean it's guarenteed to be approved, drugs with the advisory board's support pass 90% of the time!  So there's a 9 out of 10 chance we will be making tons of money!!  In addition, AIMT has a lot of new recent job openings, and if they weren't getting this drug approved, why would they be looking for so many new employees?

Palforzia is a great bandaid, but not for everyone, and with this treatment being geared toward motherfucking kids, I think it's really important to be sure about what you're doing. 14% of the participants in the clintrials (52 people) still had to be injected with epinephrine. Epi pen injections fucking suck, and for kids, it's scary and traumatizing and dangerous.

If you're super interested on making a wicked long call on a peanut allergy drug, DBVT is rolling out a patch in August that does the same thing, but so far, no epinephrine has been needed.

Everyday it rises by 2000. Why is that so? And why is it worse than we think it is?

1. Because they don't have the capacity to detect more than 2000 a day. 

2. Increasing the number of cases slowly will allow them to develop a vaccine and help recover the markets, as opposed to instantly killing the markets by saying there are 100,000+ cases.

3. Fatality rate for the common flu is 0.005%, compared to Coronas 2-3%. Let that sink in.

4. A lot of people undoubtedly will have the corona, but the symptoms for them specifically won't be that bad so they'll never go in to get checked. Consequently, they'll keep spreading it around.  

5. You can be asymptomatic for up to 14 days after being infected with the virus. Next two weeks will be spicy.

I reckon corona will peak around 20th Feb, around which time markets will begin to stabilize.

I've held TSLA from under $200 until $650ish yesterday. I've now switched to a short position. I'm no expert, but my hunch is that this is a sort of mass hysteria. 

As far as car manufacturers go, their market cap is second only to Toyota. This seems absurd to me. I get it though, they're a tech company. They have a great public perception and a massive head start on a charging network. 

I don't think their self-driving AI is *that* advanced though. And if data is the issue, any big manufacturer can easily equip their new models with cameras and collect way more data real fast.

DD,WWE - Dropped 20% on Friday and still has a ways to go.,49,exdmgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exdmgo/wwe_dropped_20_on_friday_and_still_has_a_ways_to/,51,1580624337.0,"Disclaimer:  I bought puts on Friday.  Pocket change for most of you but a chunk of my play around money.  I am just a guy with an internet connection so do your own research as well before dropping loads of money based on what some dude on the internet says.

TLDR:  Stock is down,  fires multiple execs on Friday.  Delivered lowered guidance and reports earnings this week.  Lots of indicators of a blood bath.  Puts and more puts.  They don’t own XFL so that can’t save them.

So on Thursday after hours WWE fired two of the their c suite executives and issued guidance that full year OBITDA was going to come in at low end of $180m range for year.  Stock dropped 20% of Friday.  Shit barely registered on most radars since the market decided to melt down.

Seemed like a good play for a dead cat bounce to make some quick money.  Until you look under the hood and it’s a case of how the fuck did this stock run up so far.  It has a 3.8b market cap with net revenue of likely under 800m a year.  It’s PE is 93.62 and it’s primary source of revenue is network and cable television.

The primary driver of its run up was announced deals with Fox for 1b for 5 years for broadcast rights and $265m a year for 5 years from
USA.  For a total of $465m a year in content rights,  this is significant increase over 2018 total of $269m.  Extra 200m in income is a huge deal.  

Except the numbers aren’t quite so clean.  From the WWE investor relations:

https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/news/press-releases/2018/06-26-2018-215923315

The 2020 chart shows $435 with 80m to be negotiated.  Which is $200m more than the 2018 chart.  However it’s projecting $311m for 2019.  End of quarter 3 this year they were at $209m.  So they would need $102m in order to hit the $311 number for the 4th quarter.  In order to hit $435 for 2020 that would be $108.75 per quarter.  

Since these are contracts let’s assume that they will hit the 110m for that number.  So that should be an extra 110m in operating income.  However they issued guidance for $180m in OIBDA.  So they are expecting an extra 108m in OIBDA.  All of which is tied up in the extra money from media contracts with the rest of the business actually declining by 2m.

That’s their numbers and quite simply put the year to date numbers are some bullshit when it comes to OIBDA because more than half of that number ytd comes from stock compensation which is accounting voodoo to make income look higher than it actually is.  Standardize that shit out and they made $16m of operating income.  

So if they can translate that extra $110m into bottom line it’s $126m for the year.  They have a 50m share float so EPS for the year in a best case scenario is $2.2 for a P/E of 24 at the current share price.

That is best case scenario assuming you can drag the extra tv money cleanly from one line to another and all other costs and revenues hold constant.

Which is almost certainly not the case since for the first time in 20 years we now have a competitive marketplace.  At the same time that WWE was debuting on Fox, a competitor was debuting on TNT.  Shalid Kahn (owner of Jacksonville Jaguars) and his son have launched a second professional wresting organization.  Despite the organization being smaller and without the level of clout, it provides competition for talent and has already signed at least 1 performer away from WWE.  I am not going to delve too far into the details on this as others will likely be far better educated on it, but that means a dramatic increase in costs for labor as there are now realistic alternatives.

Given how slim margins have been, see the above note of 15m profit year to date,  this is particularly bad.  The new TV deal may give them some breathing room but given that all other segments of the business have been declining quarter over quarter for multiple years  the growth picture is pretty ugly.  

Which points to this quarters results as being a peak from which things will decline as the broadcasting deal will not increase but other costs appear primed to significantly increase.  

Under these circumstances firing two of the top three people in the company prior to earnings release looks like a canary in a coal mine moment.  

Looking through the earnings live attendance for events only averages less than 6,000 people and in fact the live performances seem to break even cost or borderline negative.  As these live events provide the content for the television business there isn’t an option to reduce the number of events and maintaining a live production ensures that costs will remain high.  For a company with only 200m in cash on hand that’s a problem.

A negative earnings report at this juncture should cause a run on the stock and the firing of two executives seems to indicate that is exactly what is coming up.  Of particular concern might be if either of the television contracts have opt out provisions as performance has been steadily declining over the past few years.",2020-02-02 01:18:57

I have used past growth data and am using the current total average growth rate to predict future growth numbers. 

I am pulling my data from the Johns Hopkins CSSE Interactive Map. Click [here](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) to check it out for yourself.

I excluded 1/25 because of the irregular growth rate. I will be updating the data as to refine and update the ""Average Growth Rate"" used in creating the projections and I will post those updates daily. 

Feel free to comment with questions, concerns, criticism etc. I'd love some feedback. Take this with a grain of salt. This only factors in historical growth and does not reflect the measures being taken by world governments to curb the ""epidemic"". Then again, the model has been pretty close to the real growth rates thus far.

DD,Zealand Pharma - ZEAL - Flying under everyone's radar,18,exz3kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exz3kj/zealand_pharma_zeal_flying_under_everyones_radar/,31,1580722349.0,"  Going public on the NYSE in 2017, Zealand Pharma (ZEAL) has been a powerhouse stock especially over the past year increasing steadily from $14 up to its current $36.50. I believe the stock has not lost its steam and is set to exceed $50 within 9 months if it maintains its momentum.

Somehow, Zealand has remained under the radar of many investors despite the incredible growth over the past year. This pharma company with a $1.29 billion market cap only trades a daily average of 11,000 shares.

Steadily rising stock price combined with incredibly low volume is a great recipe for a large breakout. Positive news has caused massive spikes in value for the company as buyers come in fast in the past, and I see this trend continuing. 2020 has several large catalysts on the horizon which will bring the stock price towards $50 as the trend upwards continues.

**Cash Position**

The company had revenues of $4.4 million with operating expenses of $62.9 million leaving the company with a cash position of $225 million at the end of Q3 2019. Q1 and Q2 of 2019 saw net expenditures for operations at $41.5 million combined, representing a dramatic increase in Q3 operating costs.

The very minor revenues are not guided as they are result of licensing agreements with Alexion as well as royalties from Sanofi and do not make a significant impact on the bottom line. The company projects that expenditure will remain roughly around $60 million per quarter moving forward stemming from heavy research and development expenses as well as admin expenses.

Due to the current cash position and increased expenses seen recently, the company will likely be strapped for working capital by year end 2020. This will result in a public offering of new shares to bring in working capital to cover R&D expenses.

While typically we would see heavy backlash from an offering, looking at the price action the stock has risen following a capital raise/offering. April 1st 2019 the Company announced a $200 million offering as well as on September 5 2019 the company issued 3.957 million shares as a placement to raise $83.94 million. Both times, the company saw a rise in share price as seen below. Will the next substantial raise be any different? I think not for this powerhouse.

**Drug Pipeline**

Zealand has 10 solid drug candidates in their pipeline that are targeting six indications with an additional three indications undisclosed at this time.

The Company's main focus is gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases where they believe their peptide-based products can meet market demand. Peptides are an underutilized market that offer great patient benefits such as easy dosing with small volume subcutaneous dosing, reduced dosing frequency and highly specific to reduce side effects.

Most indications are still in preclinical and Phase I/II, however they do have 3 late stage indications that are showing great promise. Below are two that I will highlight and focus on as I believe they are the big drivers currently.

**Glepaglutide GLP-2 Analog for Short Bowel Syndrome**

Short bowel syndrome is a debilitating disease that affects roughly 40,000 individuals in the US and Europe according to market research. Leaving patients with gastrointestinal tract average length that is a mere 25% of the average persons, this leaves people with life-long dependency and at risk to life-threatening infections.

Zealand is developing a GLP-2 Analog (Glucagon Like Peptide) that was effective and well tolerated in Phase II clinical studies. With an effective half-life of approximately 50 hours, the company is targeting a once-weekly dosing system utilizing an autoinjector. 18 patients were selected for randomized treatment with glepaglutide and 16 completed the trial. Treatment with glepaglutide was associated with increase in TE (transient elastography) and ICG-elimination (indocyanine green).

In the 10 mg dose group, glepaglutide increased sCD163 (soluble CD163) by 0.44 mg/mL (*P* *=* 0.0498), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) decreased in the 1 mg dose group by 33 u/L (*P* *=* 0.032). CAP (controlled attenuation parameter), sMR (soluble mannose receptor), LBP (lipopolysaccharide binding protein), liver transaminases, and INR (international normalized ratio) were not affected.

Zealand found that glepaglutide shows signs of improvement in hepatic excretory function, but at the same time activate resident liver macrophages and increase liver stiffness. The excretory and the stiffness findings may to some extent relate to increased splanchnic blood flow which would not influence the marker of macrophage activation. How glepaglutide effected the liver status calls for further research in future studies and draws slight concern.

The results also suggest that glepaglutide may play a role in the restoration of the disturbed homeostatic feedback in the gut-liver axis and thereby SBS associated liver damage. Glepaglutide may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of IFALD for which no currently approved medical treatment options exists.

The Phase II study found that short-term treatment with glepaglutide induced increases in TE, ICG elimination, sCD163 as well as a reduction in plasma ALP, and total bilirubin. CAP and gut integrity as assessed by LBP were not measurably affected. Although there was no significant difference between the 1 mg and 10 mg dose groups regarding any of the above mentioned assessments, changes were primarily seen in the 10 mg dose group.

Essentially, the results met several endpoints for:

· Increase in intestinal fluid and energy absorption

· Significant reduction in fecal wet weight output

· Increase in urine production

· Increase in body weight

Zealand has enrolled its first patients in the Phase III extension study of glepaglutide for the treatment of SBS that will evaluate the long-term safety of treatment. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to glepaglutide and the study will enroll more than 120 patients across the US, Canada and Europe. The company is projecting results from the Phase III study in 2021.

The potential of this indication will allow Zealand to tap into a massive market that is more than $1.5 billion. The company is targeting USA, EU and Japan as the main markets for activity which are projected to grow at a CAGR of 27% through 2027 and reach an approximate $4.7 billion market size. With various treatments for SBS out there that dont quite hit the mark, Zealand is looking to capitalize on this opportunity.

**Dasiglucagon HypoPal Rescue Pen for Severe Hypoglycemia**

Hypoglycemia is a constant fear for diabetes patients on insulin therapies, with more than 6 million people in the US utilizing insulin. Approximately 40% of patients who have Type 1 diabetes experience severe hypoglycemia every year which results in roughly 300,000 hospitalizations annually.

Combating this, Zealand is developing the HypoPal Rescue Pen, a ready-to-use rescue treatment for severe hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is an acute, life-threatening condition resulting from a critical drop in blood glucose levels associated primarily with insulin therapy.

Phase III trial demonstrates that a single dose of dasiglucagon rapidly increases blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes following insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The trial compares the glycemic response observed after administration of dasiglucagon with that of placebo and with reference to the current market competitor, Novo Noridsk's (NVO) GlucaGen, in powder form for reconstitution prior to injection.

The study achieved the primary endpoint as well as all key secondary endpoints which is an impressive feat. The primary endpoint was time to plasma glucose recovery (increase in plasma glucose of ≥20 mg/dL) from baseline without administration of rescue intravenous glucose. 168 subjects were included in the trial. 82 in the dasiglucagon arm, 43 in the placebo arm, and 43 in the GlucaGen arm.

The primary result demonstrates that the median time to blood glucose recovery was:

· Dasiglucagon - 10 minutes

· Placebo - median: 40 minutes

· GlucaGen - 12 minutes

Clearly, Dasiglucagon was a winner with a greater median time to recovery that was 17% faster than GlucaGen.

Additionally, 99% of subjects were recovered from the insulin-induced hypoglycemia within 15 min following dosing with dasiglucagon, versus 2% with placebo and 95% with GlucaGen. While not seeming too significant, it shows a more reliable recovery. Overall, no safety concerns were raised for dasiglucagon within the trial. Nausea and vomiting were reported with similar numbers for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen® (nausea: 55% and 53%, vomiting: 23% and 19%, respectively).

The submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. FDA is on track for early 2020. When looking at expenses, the bump of $20 million the past quarter can be related to the buildup of U.S. commercial operations which has been accelerated in the last quarter with recruitment for key leadership positions ongoing. Seeing substantial movement in price on the stock from positive announcement (over 6% that morning) approval from the NDA would send this stock to new highs.

**Additional Comments**

Zealand is also on a partnering spree, having acquired Encycle therapeutics and teamed up with Alexion and Beta Bionics, the company is spreading itself out into amazing groups.

With Alexion, Zealand has provided their partner with exclusive worldwide licenses for a preclinical target that allows for the option of up to three additional targets that are projected to start clinical development this year. Additionally, this will provide very key financial terms to Zealand upon certain milestones.

· $40 million in upfront cash and equity investments

· $115 million in potential development and regulatory milestones

· $495 million in potential commercial milestones

· Up to low double digit royalties on net sales

· Additional 3 targets provide $15 million upfront for each target with development/regulatory milestones, commercial milestones and royalties

Partnering with Boehrigner Ingelheim, can provide a combined $712.8 million with low double digit royalties on global sales for GLP-1/glucagon dual analog and amylin analog drug candidates.

**Summary and Thoughts**

The company is also in a good cash position but does project increase in operating expenses as it prepares for commercialization. There will likely be a raise in the second half of 2020 as it prepares to go to market and continue operations with the rest of its pipeline. The company does plan on utilizing partnerships with licensing agreements to offset some incurred expenses.

The market sizes are also a concern. The SBS and insulin markets are fairly well sized, but they do have a fair amount of competition. Zealand does offer greater results, but not a significant difference in my opinion. Comparing Dasiglucagon recover of 10 minutes with the GlucaGen recovery of 12 minutes, you must consider how physicians will alter prescriptions. Is that 2 minutes a significant amount that would cause the desire to change? If you are a patient suffering from hypoglycemia I would say absolutely. 2 minutes in that situation can feel like a lifetime.

The share price has been on a great run the past year, more than doubling with little sign of reversing. Positive news such as the NDA filing and updates to clinical trials or word from the FDA will bring volume to the stock and likely drive the price high. Large fluctuations in the share price are all off of low volume and positive news and new data could drive this stock up 10% or more.

I am bullish on the stock and would not change my stance unless the FDA denied approval. The management team is expanding and with the outlook of positive data flow in 2020 we should see a continuation of growth to a PT of $50. We may see an additional 100% growth in this next year like 2019 saw, but I am going to be optimistic but conservative with 30%.",2020-02-03 04:32:29

***News Recap***

If you haven't read it yet, [here's the article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-cenbank/china-to-inject-174-billion-of-liquidity-on-monday-as-markets-reopen-idUSKBN1ZW074).

There is no amount of effort the government can make at this point to prevent the tidal wave of sell-off that will occur. People need their money, companies need to stay afloat. 

The only major affecting factors that could happen, and are not likely, is that the markets do not open again and/or the government prevents stockholders from selling.

> There will be no further delays to the reopening, the securities market regulator said in an interview in the People’s Daily newspaper on Sunday.

That's one scenario out of the picture. The other is highly, HIGHLY unlikely and in any case, if they did, either it would only add to the surmounting volitility and negative market sentiment. 

What they **are** doing is preventing short selling. See [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-china-shortselling/china-moves-to-limit-short-selling-as-virus-looms-over-market-reopening-idUSL4N2A20FA).

This could potentially pigeonhole additional stockholders and traders into selling. We will see.

***Another Perspective***

Imagine you are a business owner or private citizen in China right now. In many regions, you are barred from working and isolated in an almost house arrest state of affairs. Your finances are unstable because you have been out of work on a mandatory extended vacation while a new strain of virus runs rampant over your country. 

> [“We can’t work and have no income. I would rather work than stay at home and do nothing,” said 32-year-old restaurant worker Wu Caixia in Beijing.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/china-seeks-to-boost-economy-as-first-virus-death-reported-outside-its-borders-idUSKBN1ZW00F)

Now, the markets are opening up, but with restrictions. You can sell. You can buy. You can hold. That's about it. No speculation. No bullshit. You have a straight exit to liquidate and get your money to help you and your family get through this uncertain and fearful time. What do you think people will do?

***What's Going On Now***

Uncertainty of the viral situation is still prevalent according to [this update](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/china-seeks-to-boost-economy-as-first-virus-death-reported-outside-its-borders-idUSKBN1ZW00F).

> The vice governor of China’s Hubei province, Xiao Juhua, said the virus outbreak was still “severe and complicated”.

> Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the risk of further contraction in the region’s economy, which was buffeted by anti-government protests last year, has increased due to the epidemic.
Catering, retail, tourism and consumer sectors, which have been hit in the last six months, would “fall into a deeper winter”, Chan said.

Many companies are extending their work suspension *voluntarily* through the better part of February.

> China Evergrande Group, the nation’s third-largest property developer, said in an internal note it would extend its Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 16, and suspend construction work at all of its 1,246 sites until Feb. 20.

*Evacuations and Travel Bans*

Forgive the extended quote here, but it is pertinent to understand the complexity of the situation and evolution of events as they unfold.

> However, a string of countries have ramped up border controls. Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been to China from entering their territories, and Australia followed suit on Saturday.

> Russia will start evacuating Russian citizens on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported.

> The Philippines expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China, widening an earlier restriction that covered only those from Hubei province. Indonesia also barred visitors who have been in China for 14 days.

> More than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt on Saturday after being evacuated from Wuhan. Two of them had the virus, adding to the eight cases in Germany already in quarantine.
About 250 Indonesians were also evacuated from Hubei.

> Japan plans to send another chartered plane mid-week or later to bring back Japanese nationals who are still in Hubei, its foreign ministry said on Sunday.

> Japan has barred foreigners who have been in Hubei from entering the country. South Korea will impose a similar entry ban from Tuesday, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said.

***What's The Game Plan***

At this point you should already be invested in a variety of shorts on Chinese stock and ETFS. Some of these include:

- Puts on FXI
- Puts on YINN
- Calls on YANG (an inverse fund)

I am a big fan of hedging risk by shorting funds rather than individual stocks, but some of those may include:

- BABA 
- LK
- NIO
- TCEHY

While others may prefer airline stocks or financials, you probably will not go wrong in any case judging by the severity of the current climate.  Chime in and I will update with adding in your choice stocks/funds

*Am I Too Late?*

I don't think so. As things have progressed, the market is looking ripe for additional sell-off. It is likely that you will be able to get in on Monday or another day this week and still profit in the weeks to come. But do understand the risk you are taking having not been ahead of the curve by shorting the market last week.

You may be able to safely short the American markets at this point as well. **Production lines are forecast to be highly disrupted** from companies operating in China.

***Amount To Sell***

Originally my plan for this was to sell off 100% of my puts for tomorrow after Shanghai markets open up. I shifted to 50% late last week and now I am calling a 10-20% sell, to hold the remaining amount for further market sell-off.

This may change, but for now let's stick with it and see how Shanghai markets react later today. I may change my forecast to hold all puts. 

*Early Expiration Puts*

If your puts expire this week, I would highly consider getting out no later than Wednesday to protect yourself from market pushback. I always try to err on the side of caution, but play it by ear. I don't want to see you retards lose on a great play so close to proper execution.

***Final Thoughts***

Remember, Shanghai will be opening at 8:30pm EST today. Set your watches and clench your buttholes, this week should be extremely exciting.

Yours truly, LiquidityMan

Tl;dr - Sell 10-20% of your puts tomorrow, possibly 0% depending on market conditions. Market outlook is uncertain, prime for additional sell-off. May not be too late to get in on shorting the market.

***Updates***

Update: Feb. 2nd, 5pm EST - It looks like the Chinese government has done two additional things:

1. They are moving to prevent their citizens from shorting the stock market.

> China has taken steps to limit short-selling activities as the country’s financial markets prepare to reopen on Monday amid an outbreak of a new coronavirus, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters

2. They are preventing sales of stock bought on margin.

>  The sources said China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had issued a verbal directive to brokerages including Citic Securities Co. and China International Capital Corp. to bar their clients from selling borrowed stocks on Feb. 3.

* Their own University lab [modeled the fatality rate](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018952v1.full.pdf) at 6.5%, comparable to SARS, and with a \~40% higher transmission rate than SARS
* Death does not occur immediately with infection, so simply comparing today's fatalities with today's infections does NOT yield the correct estimate. You need to project forward \~7 days which means the \~300 fatalities were relevant to the infection rate 7 days ago, NOT to today's rate. The same was evident with SARS: [https://twitter.com/chuckhasluck\_/status/1223373987624947713](https://twitter.com/chuckhasluck_/status/1223373987624947713).

If you came in early you still made profit. But when it comes down to the behavior we'll be seeing this week, GTFO out of FXI. 

The Chinese market does not operate like the US market. Chinese trading floors classify stocks in 3 categories.

A shares. Can only be traded using RMB currency. These are all your small cap, mid cap, and some large cap stocks. These stocks are the heart of China and represent Chinese health. They can only be traded by Chinese investors, and their exposure to foreign investment is highly limited.

B shares. Can be traded using foreign currency. They are mostly large cap, and are traded not just on the Chinese floors, but on foreign floors as well. Think Taiwan. Think Tokyo. Think Hong Kong.

H shares. Can only be traded using Hong Kong dollars and are traded on HK only.

Think about it. The Chinese stock exchanges were closed for 10 days. Those are the ones that hold the investments of nationals. Those are the ones that will be having massive sell offs due to sell order build up. Last night, the SSE and A50 (tracking A shares) reached the -8% almost instantly at open. Meanwhile, the markets that trade B and H shares (HK, Taiwan, and Tokyo SE) have all been open and those companies have slowly been bleeding out with no volatility build up. 

I can expect overnight behavior to be consistent throughtout the week. FXI/EWT/EWH/DXJ might keep spiking up due to the CCP liquidity injections going mostly towards the companies ""too big too fail"", that is, those that are listed on Shanghai, HK, Taiwain, Tokyo markets. Meanwhile, the smaller A share companies will keep tanking overnight as Chiense investors pull out to have liquid cash. I will close all my FXI/EWT/EWH/DXJ positions and go into ASHR/CHAU/KBA, which track both A and B type shares. 

If Im right, those will tank by tomorrow morning, while FXI will keep spiking up. Not worth the risk holding onto FXI at the moment. ASHR offers the same reward at much lower risk. 

Also, I know this will fall on deaf ears but stop asking me about getting 3-5 DTE. Dont be retarded. Go at least 2 weeks out.

What we did not foresee is that apparently the PBoC infused cash into the largest cap companies, namely the ones in the FXI which many of us shorted.

Now, there are many paths we can take from here. The most popular is jumping ship and transferring FXI puts to ASHR puts to try and clean up from the continuing decline of the peripheral economy.

Shit is in [free fall over there](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/markets-in-mainland-china-plunge-9-after-layoff-losses-extend-across-asia-2020-02-02?mod=home-page) only to be caught in the lower circuit breakers of the market. Is this a one-day scenario? Probably not.

And the stocks are not the only ones in free fall. Many commodities [also hit their lower brackets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-russell-china-health-commoditi/chinas-commodities-got-smashed-as-expected-now-what-russell-idUSKBN1ZX0GX).

The problem is, we do not have numbers of how much money is going where from the cash infusions or how long they will last. It may be a safer bet to jump to ASHR as the government is not likely and perhaps does not have the ability to prop up thousands of smaller businesses that are feeling the pinch.

That's all for now. I will chime in with my trades tomorrow at some point.

With their 6-yr deal with Apple they have a stronger revenue projection. Although, they won’t be supplying this until probably end of the year.

This quarter won’t have much to tell, but analyst already know this and have adjusted earnings expectations to be relatively weak.

Facebook did their earnings and showed a strong growth in their other revenue section which is mainly coming from their Oculus Quest VR sales. This is only about 330m though, but this was for Q4 2019.

Qualcomm supplies the Oculus Quest with their snapdragon chipset. The Quest killed sales this year for Christmas selling out everywhere and had a ship date of mid-January around the end of December. This ship date continued to grow through January and is currently now March 3rd. This isn’t due to shipping delays but actual orders (I have a Quest and have just been in general watching the ship date/there’s continuing to be more players online).

Qualcomm will focus on 5g and those potentials, but maybe this added revenue can give them a bit of a boost/talking point.

Let me know if you’re playin it or if you have other good info!

**The decline**

Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. 

Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space.

**The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities**

Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 

2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. 

Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have *nothing.*

**A story of stagnation**

Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel.

Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

**Meeting competition**

[Leaked internal Intel slide](https://preview.redd.it/xyiri8120ve41.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba9ff52ebbe2b4106f0859f13569c3e41d29e5c)

&#x200B;

We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP\* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat.

Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. 

A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details.

\*MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.”

**The future**

Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”.

These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

If you have any questions or I got something wrong tell me in the comments, also do not blame any of the people and or sources mentioned, all opinions expressed are solely mine, and may not reflect other’s.

1. Even with the surge it recently had through January, its still hilariously undervalued compared to its potential as the sole publicly traded company in a future multitrillion+ dollar industry. Thats a conservative estimate too. Once we start pushing the envelope with exploring and exploiting nearby celestial bodies, the economy and life as we know it is going to hit a singularity similar to the rise of the internet.  Even if Virgin Galactic stayed as nothing more than a space taxi through that boom, its position as an enabler with an established reputation and infrastructure would permit it to easily ride out the inevitable fluctuations when the space equivalent of the .com bubble pops.

2. Trump is pro space. With high odds of getting a second term, Space Force and the space industry as a whole is going to find itself in the limelight more and more, with inevitable bloated contracts being pushed through and money being funneled towards private companies who can get plausible bids through. Virgin Galactic has already established a foothold with NASA and a working relationship with the defense industry in Italy, positioning them to capture some very lucrative R&D funding and a place at the US defense-industrial complex pig trough. 

3. Space captures peoples imaginations. Trite but true. They've got a cool ticker and a shortcut to people's sense of imagination. Boomers who were kids when Neil Armstrong hopped off that ladder still have a soft spot in their hearts for that awe they felt. Any who made it big would either buy this stock out of nostalgia, or book a flight to scratch that midlife crisis and think about when they got head in their daddy's car after A New Hope blew their minds.

4. Their success will drive other companies to go public. Everyone at TSLA  and across the world just saw how crazy rich they can get off a meme stock and a dream. You think Daddy Musk is going to let that go to waste with fucking SpaceX? As soon as Branson hits that zero g on his birthday, you can bet Elon is going to be smoking a joint and thinking about taking SpaceX public at 420.69.

TTWO is down almost 5% today because the VP of Rockstar games is stepping down. He’s already been on leave for months. Seems like an overreaction to me.


Here’s why I bought Calls:

• Gta and read dead online hit record numbers of players in December. 

• both GTA and read dead online have constantly been releasing new expansions are not cheap and I bought them and I know hella people did

• The stock has been getting hit this past week so it’s at the lows for the past two weeks

• TTWO has a high rate of beating earnings and delivering surprises


Here’s a few additional bullish thoughts:

GTA online is rewarding everybody who logs in between now and Feb 13th $1,000,000 gta cash to celebrate record numbers. Seems pretty damn bullish to me. 

The Casino addition to GTA is one of the biggest money makers they added. Blackjack, poker, roulette, horse betting. I think this virtual casino can create gambling addicts who will be sucking dick for that gta virtual currency for quarters to come. 



TLDR: Buy TTWO, stock down, earnings tomorrow, usually beat earnings

DD,PTON Subscriber Numbers,26,ezbsr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ezbsr6/pton_subscriber_numbers/,42,1580947808.0,"I've been a PTON cult member for years now but haven't taken a position on shares/calls before today. The bike itself shows a decent amount of user data, so I had the bright idea to try to back into sub numbers using the below calculations. Every number here is definite EXCEPT for my assumption for the rate of bikers signing up for the annual challenge (see below).

Based on my calculations, plus anecdotal evidence of exponentially increased activity over the past few months on the official Facebook groups and in the live rides, I believe PTON will beat expectations. HOWEVER, I also believe they are fundamentally overvalued here (I know, who cares about that in wsb land).  Therefore, I am playing this by buying calls as a pure lotto play.  I will buy shares if the price drops after lockup period expires.

IPO: 1.4M members / 511,202 subscribers = 2.74 members per sub

Q1: 1.6M members / 562,774 subscribers = 2.84 members per sub

Q2 projected : 680K-685K subs

As of today, there were 362,578 participants in the ""Annual Challenge"".  This is a challenge that not many people know about/sign up for. It's not worth much except if you are motivated by these types of things.   I believe the rate of members signing up for this challenge is about 15%.

So... 362,578 / 15% = 2,417,187 members / 2.84 members per sub = 851,122 total subs vs 680K-685K projected.  Keep in mind: 1) my calculation is as of today, not as of the end of Q2, and 2) my 15% signup rate is a pure guess based on my PTON cult knowledge. Anyone else who owns a PTON can chime in with guesses about the challenge sign up rate.

Tl;dr - I expect PTON to beat subscriber estimates based on my shoddy calculations. Buy calls at your own risk.",2020-02-05 19:10:08

Intelsat has been part of an ongoing dispute with the FCC over selling off the C-Band to enable the spread of 5G technology. They currently have about 14 Billion in debt, which has given their side of the negotiations a bit of urgency.

The FCC was playing hardball, and apparently coordinating with Senators in order to get the lowest price possible for the auctioning of these assets, with the Senators proposing a 1 Billion total buy price, and the FCC offering 10 Billion max, with Intelsat receiving 45% of that at most.

Intelsat told them to go fuck themselves, and that they would declare chapter 11 if the FCC didnt give them more, or allow private auctioning, which could result in proceeds as high as 77 billion.

This resulted in an aftermaket agreement with the FCC, details yet to be disclosed. All anyone knows is that its settled. 

On a separate note, theres been some weird wild fluctuations on low volume traded calls for this stock, which have resulted in several high spikes in price over the past couple days. 

Puts are an option, but honestly I'd go for the dirt cheap calls as a relatively low cost bet with potentially sky high payoff.

If the FCC has bumped their offer to anything close to market value, this company could go from owing 14 billion to debt free and showing a profit literally overnight.",2020-02-07 06:47:35

The entire set is ""fairy-tale"" themed, and they're heavily investing in this digital product, including a [spiffy trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzBrfW7Ipzg), an [RPG](https://www.pcgamer.com/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-story-driven-rpg-studio-led-by-ex-bioware-vets/), rumors of a Netflix series, and greater [whale-monetization strategies](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/secret-lair-recap-2019-11-25). Looks like Brian Goldner has finally decided it's time to put you autists to work, and your efforts are going to lead to a top-line boon to revenues. You might think Mark Rosewater is your friend, but simmering just below his friendly smile and unadulterated love for the game is a deep-seated desire to take your money at any cost. Haven't you noticed all the ""gold"" and ""treasure"" tokens lately? You're ripe for the picking, and it's harvest time at Hasbro, baby.

For the Chads and Stacies that have managed to overcome their autism for long enough to procreate, these guys not only make all the toys for the Marvel universe, but they're doing all the Frozen toys too. 

I'd say ""enough said"" but I am still blown away by how ridiculous Frozen was for revenues last time around, so I'll recap it here. 

2013 Q4: Frozen releases November 27, 2013. Originally, Frozen toys weren't made by Hasbro, but they kept selling out, so Disney partnered with HAS to help get the gravy train flowing. 

2014 Q4: In the quarterly conference call (FEB9, 2015), Deb Thomas says

>Full-year product development expense increased to 5.2% of
revenues. Investment in our brands and in innovation is ongoing and
strategically important for Hasbro. As we previously communicated,
we began development of the Disney Princess and Frozen properties
in the fourth quarter, ahead of revenues which do not commence until
2016. As a result, as anticipated, 2014 product development expense
was above the high end of our typical product development range of
4.5% to 5.0%.

>In 2015, we anticipate product development as a percent of sales to be
in the range of 5.0% to 5.5%. This expense should return to our more
normalized range in future years as we begin to recognize revenues
associated with the Disney Princess and Frozen properties. 

2015 Q4: Feb 8 2016, in the Q4/year-end results Brian Goldner says they've started shipping on schedule:

>In 2016, Hasbro’s line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY’S FROZEN
fashion dolls and small dolls became available. These products are
already on shelves in the U.S. and rolling out internationally. We shipped
a very small amount of product in the fourth quarter given the timing of
retailer plans. Shipments are now ramping up and early consumer
indications are positive. Great partnership with Disney and our global 
retailers is resulting in a smooth transition, with product on shelf
beginning in January. We are closely monitoring inventory at retail to
ensure this continues in 2016, as revenues grow and we build greater
efficiency and profitability into this new business. 

Deb Thomas in agreement:

>To fully execute our strategy, investments in innovation are paramount
to our long-term success. Product development totaled 5.5% of
revenues. This includes the investment in our DISNEY PRINCESS
and DISNEY’S FROZEN offerings for which revenues commenced in
January in a more meaningful way. 

In the financials, Q4 Girls Revenue is 312.4 M, down 10% from the previous year, Fiscal Year 2014 Girls revenue is 1022.6 M, up 2% over the previous year.

Less notable: Magic is lackluster this year.

2016 Q1: ""Girls category revenues increased 41% to $165.4 million. The first quarter marked the on shelf date for Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN fashion and small dolls. The addition of these brands along with DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS and growth in BABY ALIVE delivered strong quarterly revenue growth for the category. The Girls category increased 48% absent the impact of foreign exchange."" Yes, 165.4 for girls is ""up 41%"" over Q1 2015's 117.1, not over Q4's 312.4, but it's still 41%.

2016 Q2: ""Girls category revenues increased 35% to $172.3 million. Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN fashion and small dolls along with revenue growth in BABY ALIVE led the increase in the quarter."" This time over Q2 2015's 127.5.  The other categories hover around 5% growth over previous year, which means that Hasbro would still be a good company without Disney.

2016 Q4/year-end: ""**Girls category revenues in 2016 grew 50% to a record $1.19 billion.** The category benefited from shipments of Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN fashion and small dolls, the successful launch of DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and significant growth from BABY ALIVE. Additional revenue growth came from Hasbro brands including FURREAL FRIENDS and EASY-BAKE OVEN products."" The percentage is fuzzy, since these lying pieces of shit said that Q4 2015 girls category revenue was 258.8, not the 312.4 reported back then, and full year was 798.2, not 1022.6, but even using the old numbers it's up 26% comparing just the quarters, and 16% for the full year.

So, knowing what Frozen toys did for Hasbro, when they came to the party a year late... how will they fare when they're in it from the beginning?

Also, Nerf has been doing better than it was last year (some Fortnight related shit, idk, I'm not 12), and they've got preorders of Mandalorian toys. Someone fucked up with the [Baby Yoda](https://www.space.com/baby-yoda-hasbro-toys-coming-2020.html) toy supply chain, so I assume heads will roll over the lost profits, but better late than never. They've also bought Entertainment One, which is some movie making thing, so I guess it's time for the MTG movie or another Dungeons and Dragons movie.

Also, Hasbro has invested in mobile phone shovelware if that matters to you. Also, fucking Power Rangers are back, and that [shit rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=468GDmRsUQY). 

So how does it all go wrong?

Well, maybe this Corona Virus bullshit is going to fuck up the supply chain and that will be reflected in the forward looking statements. There's also trade war BULLSHIT that fucked up earnings earlier. Was Star Wars bad enough to ruin both Marvel and Frozen? Doubt it.

EXCEPT for revenue guidance for next quarter, which was $470-480m in revenue vs. high end expectations of $507m. Apparently their delivery logistics shaved off a couple days vs. last year, pulling forward 6,000 deliveries, or about 5% of revenue from 3Q20 into this current quarter. If they HADN'T improved their delivery times, revenue guidance would have been in line with expectations. Oh well. I suspect that the stock will go down this week and rebound into next week, as it did after last quarter's earnings release, going from $25 to $22 for a week, followed by the run-up to $37 as people realize the company is raising guidance for subs, revenue, and EBITDA. Just my $0.02. I still own $50 March 20th calls and I'm not selling at the moment. It'll take a few days for the sellers to clear out so expect a few down days. My notes from the call are below. 

Fiscal 2Q20 Metrics

Connected Fitness Subs came in at 712k, up 96% y/y and beating high end expectations of 703k

Revenue was $466m, up 77% y/y and beat high expectations of $443m

Engagement was strong with 12.6 avg monthly workouts per connected sub, up from 9.7 y/y

Avg churn of 0.74% was way below expectations of 1.00%

EBITDA of ($28.4m) was well ahead of estimates of ($55m)

Gross margin flat at 42.3% y/y

Has $1.5b of cash

Cash from operations was $33.2m

Capex was $48.8m due to buildout of new studios in NYC and London. Also purchased Tonic, their Taiwanese supplier for $46m

Fiscal 3Q20 Guidance

843-848k ending connected fitness subs, in line with estimates of 847k

$470-480m in revenue, up 50% y/y, but below estimates of $507m

($25-35m) EBITDA loss, in line with estimates of ($30m)

Churn below 0.95%, below estimates of 1.10%

Gross margin 43-44%

Full year guidance for FY2020-

Raised ending connected subs to 920-930k, essentially in-line with estimates of 921k

$1.53-1.55bn in revenue, up 68% y/y and in line with estimates of $1.54b

Gross margin of 43.5-44.5%

Adj EBITDA of ($95-115m), much better than ($140m) expected

Churn below 0.95%, better than 1.04% expected

Notes from the call

\-Churn was positively impacted by lower return rates and higher retention than expected

\-30% of classes taken were non cycling classes

\-Goal is to have more accessible products that can be sold to all demographics (cheaper products coming?)

\-Digital subscription is lead generation tool for selling more hardware. Makes sense why they dropped the price of the digital subscription. Running digital app at breakeven. 

\-Germany going as well as the UK launch did in 2018.

\-Return rates still in the low single digits.

\-Better delivery logistics means time from order to delivery was shortened by a few days, causing a pull forward of revenue from 3Q20 into this quarter. Hence the huge outperformance this qtr and guidance below expectations. The shift was 6,000 deliveries, or about 5% of revenue. 

\-They have new software updates that will help to gamify working out and create more of a social network around the leaderboard. 

\-no pressures yet from cheaper competition. People love the Peloton product, not just an exercise bike

\-Still early days in US, UK, Germany, and Canada. Focused on those markets before expanding to others.

\-Heading towards profitability earlier than we thought (2023). We view profitability as a managed outcome. We are prioritizing growth right now because we have low churn and we want as many subscribers as possible. Lots of leverage in G&A and Marketing.",2020-02-06 18:02:44

A lot of specualtion is being made about the chinese lying about their offical numbers. This doesn't matter since niether the media or the WHO cares. However, if the Chinese are scared of going to work, because of how widespread the virus is, it will affect markets. China is the worlds manufacturing hub, if the factories are closed for too long, we're going to see product shortages severly affecting american corporations which will impact the markets. The increased interest in APT, shows that the market is concerned about supply chain issues that could begin occurring next week. This will have massive negative impact on western markets and I'm guessing were going to see a lot of bad news starting next week. I'm thinking a 5-10% drop, a mini recession. Probably good for APT aswell. 

APT is not just an index over ongoing epidemics, it's also a great pump and dump.",2020-02-08 01:50:32
DD,Where my Pandas At?,27,f0iakn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f0iakn/where_my_pandas_at/,37,1581144082.0,"By now you all should be familiar with the term. Xi is going down. Down the fuck down, into the ground. Double dicked down by clowns. Which is why I double downed on my bearish positions today.

Ok onto the real DD.

Ed Hyman's team has China's GDP pegged at [0% for Q1 of 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/chinas-gdp-growth-this-quarter-will-be-0percent-according-to-top-economist-ed-hyman.html)

According the CNBC's latest live [blog](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/coronavirus-latest-updates.html) Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royale Carribean have banned Chinese nationals from all of their ships and Honda has suspended all operations in Wuhan through Feb. 13th.

[Shanghai is a ghost town](https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-puts-shanghai-coma-154246392.html) despite not being on mandatory lockdown. There's actually a great dark pun in this article that I caught:

> And few ***bat*** an eye any more at pausing for the ubiquitous temperature reading

And also a PSA from a China Gov't social media:

> ""You cannot disinfect yourself by standing out in the sun""

So the storm rages on and the WHO admits they know [virtually nothing](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2020-02-06/who-coronavirus-source-severity-still-unknown) about the virus and that there is still no known cure.

> WHO officials said they don't know the source of the virus and that a treatment doesn't yet exist, despite some reports claiming otherwise. They also don't fully understand how severe it is or how it is transmitted.

But everything's fine, the Chinese Gov't has this [completely under control](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3049606/coronavirus-doctors-death-becomes-catalyst-freedom-speech)

> “The news of his [Li’s] death will be very carefully managed and downplayed as much as possible. [Chinese President Xi Jinping] would not allow it to be used like the death of Hu Yaobang was in 1989.”

Oh yes, we wouldn't want another Tienamin Square incident. So of course:

> “[Xi] will double down and see the need to tighten control even further. The last thing he will allow is for him to appear weak.”

The aforementioned Li of course being the 34 year old whistle blowing doctor who tried to warn people about the virus last month as and was [reprimanded by police](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3049489/coronavirus-outpouring-grief-and-anger-after-death-whistle) is now dead.

It will do so again in the next week, if not the one after according to the charts and upcoming catalysts. Get in now if you don't want to miss out as I did last month! Some DD I've done on Virgin Galactic... Don't think it will go tits up.

The company

1. New Technologies and has successfully sent humans to space, twice. The second time [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmPG0Hqhay8). The tech is working.
2. Boeing will invest $20 million in Virgin galactic for hypersonic planes [link](https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-investing-20m-in-virgin-galactic-to-design-supersonic-vessel-2019-10)
3. Many catalysts in the coming months. Conference presentation at [Barclay industrial select conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200121005626/en/) by the CEO, the [last time he spoke](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106006011/en/Virgin-Galactic-Announces-Participation-Bank-America-Merrill) the stock rose 60% from Jan 9. ER a few days later on Feb 25. Richard Branson going on the flight himself. Risk of him dying is minimal because of point 1 above. Lastly, they are planning to send first customer to space later this summer in 2020.
4. They just  [opened registration](https://www.virgingalactic.com/join-us/) for commercial flights!  

Technicals

1. SPCE has been trading near the top of the last parabolic move since a couple of weeks ago. It pulled back a little and formed two new support levels. It has formed bullish patterns in multiple time frames - a bullish flag, ascending triangle, and a upward trend that hasn't been broken since the last parabolic move.
2. This stock is strong as fuck, the recent economic turmoil hasn't affected it a bit, it is still following the trend line and continues to consolidate at the top while slowly creeping up along the upward trend line while consolidating.
3. Last Friday it has just formed a higher low in the consolidation - a buy set up and it is safe to buy!
4. 25% of the stocks are shorts. When it breaks out of $20, they will get squeezed along with all the catalysts in the coming months.
5. Morgon Stanley has a target price of 60.  They say hypersonic travel  will have an $800 billion dollar total addressable market by 2040. SPCE  is at the head of the pack in developing the technology to enable  hypersonic point to point travel, so they could very well be a  disruptive force in this future industry.",2020-02-09 16:34:52

DD,The Massive Potential of Virgin Galactic ($SPCE),194,f21u76,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f21u76/the_massive_potential_of_virgin_galactic_spce/,143,1581418188.0,"Hey Y'all,

Fairly new here but with my last two tips I was able to help some people and figured I'd share some more insight so y'all don't yell at me when I post my gains on this one either ;-).

So I have been trading $SPCE aggressively since $7.20, just near its all time low of $6.90.  I have had more on my $SPCE options than I have ever played on anything else and I have done well on them.  I wanted to post some of the opinions I have come to have.  I haven't read other posts on $SPCE here so I am sure many of these have been brought up.

This may get long.  These are all the points I have personally observed and many of them have my personal opinion baked into them.  Sorry if some of the information is not the best organized, just writing some of the major points I can think of from my random scribbles on post its and memory.

I am sure I am missing a lot of points so I will keep this updated / edit it in the morning.  I am getting quite tired as I write this so will finish up any missing points when my brain is working again.  Either way, this continues to be my long-term play.  If I made any mistakes let me know and I will correct them as well.

I cautiously offer a mid-term price target inline with Morgan Stanley's bull target of $60.  I would not be surprised to see this happen in next 6-8 months but due to being cautious on an extremely speculative industry & stock, I will instead speculate we will see a move towards $60 early to mid 2021.

That being said, it is also on a huge uptrend right now and in the very short term we could see a retrace while we await stronger news.  I would enter at this point with some caution and be prepared to average down so you don't get emotional if it drops for a bit before moving back to all time highs.

# EDIT: To be clear - this is a long-term play for me.  None of my calls expire before June/July even.  Not that I can't see it going up further in the short term... just wouldn't risk a short-term expiration on it until some of the points below occur.

**Introductory Links & Information:**

* **Virgin Galactic** \- [https://www.virgingalactic.com/](https://www.virgingalactic.com/)
* **Virgin Galactic Investor/SEC Presentation -** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000114420419034053/tv524921\_ex99-2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000114420419034053/tv524921_ex99-2.htm)
* **The Spaceship Company** \- [http://thespaceshipcompany.com/](http://thespaceshipcompany.com/)

**It definitely has a major first-mover advantage on multiple fronts.**

* It is a first-mover in the commercial space industry,
* It is a first-mover as publicly traded company for the industry.
* It is a first-mover in the hypersonic industry.
* It is potentially a first-mover in the manufacturing/supplier vertical and has cleared the way to do so with its close relations with Boeing, IMO.

**Very few catalysts for a downturn in immediate future**

* Any known possibility for ""bad news"" seems unlikely before at least a few major catalysts for a move up.
   * Test Flight Crash
      * I see this as unlikely but it seems to be the ""worst case scenario"" in the short term for the long play.
      * They have already made it to space with their first vehicle so they have proven they are capable.
      * The crash that many talk about was pilot error, not due to manufacturing faults.
      * Before we can get to Test Flights, which would mostly run out of the Space Port, we need to get the space ships to the Space Port which will likely include many events from announcing the flight with fanfare and celebration to announcing a reopening of ticket sales (see below for those and more).
      * Before we get to Test Flights, we also have the event at the end of Feb where they seem likely to make major announcements leading into their earnings call.
   * Delayed initial flight w/ Branson
      * I can't imagine this will occur but it has been delayed in the past multiple times.
      * I have some added observations below which show why they seem confident in their schedule.
   * IPO from Blue Origin
      * It does appear that Blue Origin is gearing up for a move public.
      * *This could either:* greatly increase interest in Space and expand the industry across the board since only two options would exist
      * ***Or:*** This could break $SPCE's monopoly on the industry as it has today and move much interest to ""the new Amazon potential.""
      * Blue Origin is $SPCE's main and only major competitor that has been able to show a real potential at delivering on their promises.  They have recently conducted test flights, they have hired a comm director in recent days, and Bezos has been selling far more stock than usual (I believe just over $3 billion at time of writing this) to fund what seems to be a major strategic move.
      * I do think the announcement of Blue Origin IPO being imminent could be a temporary hit to $SPCE, but the effect will be **greatly muted** should $SPCE already have momentum, announced dates for their flights, re-opened ticket sales, etc.  **THIS IS CRITICAL** and my **#1 concern at this time** is that Bezos realizes this and the recent moves he is making are to try to move their schedule up and get ahead of them here.
      * If Blue Origin can ""steal the thunder"", if you will, before $SPCE is able to gain the worlds attention with reopening ticket sales and other things mentioned in the points above, this could prove pretty harmful to the gains we would otherwise see.  Although I think either way we would move up, there will be a whole different narrative if the ""but Blue Origin..."" footnote is added to every news release that would otherwise be solely focused on $SPCE.
      * Bezos is a shark and he's damn good at what he does.
      * Bezos is essentially ""all-in"" on space...
      * Needless to say, I will be investing major in Blue Origin as well...
   * IPO from SpaceX's StarLink is all but guaranteed
      * SpaceX has announced that they are almost surely going to be spinning off StarLink from SpaceX and going public with that.
      * Timeframe, however, does not seem to be in the immediate future and we will likely have a significant warning ahead of this move.
      * I've done fairly significant research on StarLink but will leave that to IPO announcement time since it is off-topic here.
      * There is not much competition of the two aside from them both being considered in the ""Space Industry.""  I do not think this will cause any kind of downturn.

**Boeing Clears the Way for The Spaceship Company?**

* Boeing has invested $20m (so far) into $SPCE.
   * Interestingly, Boeing seems to be turning its interest away from space & hypersonic and deferring to others to take up the mantle (meanwhile, ""working closely with $SPCE engineers at the Spaceship Company as allies""... hint hint?)
   * Interestingly, shortly after news of Boeing no longer pursuing some contracts that ""The Spaceship Company"" can easily target, all this news breaks about NASA and Space Force looking for private contract bids on many fronts they can easily service.
   * Whitesides (CEO) has mentioned that Boeing is a very active partner that their engineers are working with ""intimately"" to advance their technologies in a recent interview.
* Spaceship Company seems like a surefire spinoff of $SPCE in the near future?
   * Being able to provide hypersonic flight manufacturing services to others allows them to corner the market
   * As mentioned, their partnership with Boeing clearly gives them an advantage of Boeing's contacts & expertise
   * From what I can tell they have a significant lead on R&D from those we have seen show interest in the space.
* The Spaceship Company President promoted to COO of $SPCE
   * This feels like a move to allow Enrico to begin preparations for major moves and restructuring to bring about their Hypersonic flight ambitions.
* The Spaceship Company seems to have some clear potential for independently bidding on many of these new government contracts on top of the other pieces mentioned above.

**Hints to July First Flight Plan for Branson?**

* In a recent interview, Whitesides (CEO) mentioned how Branson was looking forward to going to space as it would essentially be his 70th Birthday present.
* Last year, Branson mentioned he wanted to time the flight with the Apollo 11 Anniversary which also coincides with his Birthday within a few days  (July 16 & 18 IIRC), quoted as saying ""... So yeah, July the 18th is my birthday so why not? We'll go for that."" [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/richard-branson-eyes-apollo-11-anniversary-trip-space/story?id=61102112](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/richard-branson-eyes-apollo-11-anniversary-trip-space/story?id=61102112)
* I have seen some hints that June is a possibility as well, but either way they appear to be quite confident in their ability to hit mid-year for the first flight.

**Re-opening Ticket Sales -- raising price per ticket?**

* Whitesides has said that due to strong demand they will likely raise their ticket pricing by a significant amount.
* Tweets and Instagram posts went out about joining their newsletter.  One of the main questions in that form was how much you would pay for a ticket.
   * It would appear they are pricing out how many they can sell at various price points to see what they might be able to open ticket sales at again.
   * If I were doing the above, I would expect a couple weeks or so to generate those leads which would include various posts that seem kind of pointless of random accomplishments as an excuse to advertise those sign-ups in the meantime -- I doubt they will want to hint at their goals to generate leads as that could affect the lead quality they receive.
   * They have a conference scheduled a few days before their earnings call at the end of the month.  It seems like they will likely plan to announce their intent to re-open ticket sales and at what price then as we lead into an earnings where they are likely to post a significant loss.  Guidance of new revenue should then be the only thing in focus.
   * Personally I believe we will see tickets go on sale for $350k with perhaps some cheaper options -- not really sure here but $350k seems to feel what they will target.

**Hints at Major Celebration Event Imminent**

* Recently someone tracked Flight Aware that their first spaceship was flying to the Mojave to join its new sibling.
   * Unless it required some sort of work done, this seems like a move where they are preparing for a major event in-which they can have press photograph the two together as they make the voyage to the Space Port together.
   * Clearly they will want to make a grand spectacle to go viral on news and garner a surge of leads leading up to ticket sales re-opening.  This seems like the perfect way of doing it?
   * They have recently announced that their second space craft is nearing completion.  They are working on the internal systems at this point.
   * They have also pointed out that they have also begun work on Spaceship 3 and that they are completing them far faster and less expensive with each iteration.
* Branson recently tweeted pictures of him at the Space Port with the entire team.
   * It seems to me they were having an all-hands on-deck meeting to discuss & plan these celebrations and coordinate the team moving into what will clearly be one of the most important events of the companies history.

**Hypersonic / Point-to-Point is a Game Changer**

* Point-to-Point is a game changer which the Virgin brand will have a moat that will be hard to beat.  Combining hypersonic options with their contacts within the airline industry from Virgin Atlantic & Virgin America to offer comprehensive travel options for any travel needs.
* Ability to do a level of cross-marketing & promotion that no other player hoping to break into PTP/Hypersonic will be able to come close to.
* Many years ahead at this point and the **only** player I am aware of that will be able to go from manufacturing of the vehicles all the way to the consumer level.
   * No one will be able to touch their pricing for the foreseeable future.  This is one reason why many are calling them the ""Tesla of Space""  [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/09/virgin-galactic-is-the-tesla-of-the-space-industry.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/09/virgin-galactic-is-the-tesla-of-the-space-industry.aspx)

**Insane Growth Opportunity**

* Some massive potential to enter industries/verticals that they have not yet indicated interest in - **pure speculation below warning.**
* Space is big - and the market opportunity for a company which is servicing every vertical which is currently practical are mind boggling.
   * As their tech evolves, being able to deliver payloads and/or people into actual orbit would increase their market potential exponentially.
   * They seem likely to approach this market as we are starting to see news of ""space hotels"" and such which would fit beautifully into their Space Tourism marketing.
   * As mentioned, they also have incredible opportunity to cross-market with other Virgin brands to achieve a level of consumer awareness that would cost competitors much more to capture.

I bought April 50 strikes ahead of earnings and yes, I’m disappointed to see chegg down AH today but I remain certain I will make a profit on this trade, my break even is 50.50 at expiration. Though if I had waited til after earnings to buy I could have bought more but no regrets, Yolo, this is the way.

Here’s why : 

chegg has a large amount of short shares, a whopping 16.9 percent of shares are in a short position,  the stock is getting shorted ah because chegg soared 5 percent today and is near a 52 week high, chegg also has a relatively low float, 116 million, 

Now With more solid earnings posted today and a possibly a new reasonable dip to buy after a period of massive growth, The share price will settle and consolidate hopefully around these resistance levels 42- 44, and the dip will start getting bought, as does any dip in this market right now, 

As solid as cheggs report was today, I think it’s safe to predict a massive short squeeze might be coming. With the low float and large shares short percentage, with the stock down after solid earnings, fundamentally I could see a rally that spurs a massive short squeeze taking the stock to new highs in the near future.",2020-02-11 02:59:56

LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor) is announcing earnings tomorrow and is worth your consideration as a YOLO for two reasons:  


1.) Jim Anderson, the CEO  
This fucker used to be my boss (corporate overlord, I never met him). Our company was sold to AVGO back when they were trading at $65/share and Mr. Anderson made out like a bandit on the increase in value in his shares. Then in May of 2015 he went to become a VP for A-M-Fucking-D. In case you were too young to remember what AMD's stock price was back then I'll remind you. It was $2.30. Motherfuckin' Jim stayed on until August of 2018 and then peace'd the fuck out to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor. You know what AMD's stock price was in August of 2018? Twenty-Five-Fucking Dollars. Homeboy literally worked for three goddamn years and 10x'd on AMD.  


So August of 2018 he goes to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor when their stock price is around $7.50 and sneaky Jimbo goes and delivers a terrible earnings, tanks the price all the way down to $5 bucks so he can accumulate shares like the sly multi-millionaire fucker he is. Then the stock proceeds to fucking skyrocket up to a peak of $24 over the next 12 months.  


So that's reason number 1. Follow the money. Follow Jimbo.  


2.) TeCHNiCAlS  
LSCC closed at $19 flat today, which is in the middle of it's $17.50 to $21.50 range over the last 5 months. However it peaked at $24.2 just 3 weeks ago.  March 20th $25 Calls went from between 20 and 30 cents today. I'm gonna buy some tomorrow because I believe in Jim.",2020-02-11 02:19:35

STEPS FOR HOW TO DO THIS INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO EVERY COMMENT -

1. Contact your broker to determine when their cutoff date is for the transaction.
2. Buy as many shares as you want (more likely to get 100% bought back at 30-33 if you have 99 since they will fill the odd lots first if literally every share holder takes advantage of this as XBIT set their limit to 420mill worth of shares bought back in this offer, with 40.9mill shares outstanding * 22 per share currently = total market cap ~900mill, )
3. Submit for tender without bid to guarantee at least 46% (420mill/900mill) of your shares get bought back at 30-33
4. Profit and roll into meme stock calls

THEY ARE NOT A HARDWARE COMPANY. ROKU is in the Ad business building a *big, next-generation’ targeted ad platform.*

As more and more people cut the cable, they will have to turn to ROKU's platform, or should I say 'ecosystems' to stream their favorite cable channels and networks. ROKU will take a % of this and be one of the largest in America, since anyone, anywhere with an internet connection can use roku to stream TV. The primary competitor is not other services on the platform, the primary competitor is linear tv - and ROKU has them beat.

**Let's look at some numbers:**

* Roku sells more dedicated streaming devices than perhaps any other company in the world. It’s been estimated that there are more Rokus in US households than there are Fire TVs, Chromecasts, or Apple TVs. Estimates say 40% of all TV's sold are Roku TV's. 
* If you read through [ROKUs dev SDK](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/advertising/roku-advertising-framework.md), you'll see they force their channel partners to use *their* ads taking a cut of all profits and subs made by, FOX, Disney+ etc.
   * *Entertainment firms pay a carriage fee to be on the cable lineup.* Roku has built itself up as an advertising company, getting a cut of the ad revenues from major media partners in exchange for the distribution. 
   * **Roku's 2019 revenues**, **67% of Roku's $1.1 billion in revenues came from ads**. Growing to $1.6 billion in 2020, with the bulk coming from advertising again. Which amounts to the revenue base more than doubling (111% projected growth rate between 2018-2020.
* ROKU's CEO went into a [Mexican standoff with FOX](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/4623654002) and fucking wonn. The guy has balls, ROKU got the superbowl and cucked FOX.

**Guidance:**

* Millions more to cut their 'cable' in 2020 and pick it back up on ROKU enabled devices and TV's
* ROKU will announce (soon) something with COMCAST 
* 1/2 of Disney subs signed up using Roku 
* Super Bowl

Inverse me cause I'm totally off my rocker and my day job has nothing to do with stonks or trading. You've been warned.  


AMD having recently broken resistance at 50 is looking to scale even greater heights. Its lining up a very strong run-up for 2020, having ripped market share from Intel in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.  


Breaking down into points for all the illiterate:  


**POINT 1: APPLE CURRENTLY TESTING AMD CHIPS IN MACBOOK PROs**  

Developers have found snippets of code suggesting that Apple developers were testing AMD chips within the kits. [AMD new chips are almost exactly the multi-core solution](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/why-apple-should-ditch-intel-for-amd/) apple need and If this pans out they may replace Intel in the near future

This leads us nicely into the next point...

**POINT 2: APPLE WANTS TO DITCH INTEL**  

Intel has famously suffered from shortages leading to Apple blaming them in slumps in sale in [May 2019](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/apple-blames-intels-processor-shortage-for-slump-in-mac-sales). They still can't get their shit together and [cant even confirm  if they can meet 2020 production.](https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/intels-cpu-shortage-impact-chip-giants-pc-makers/).  
They even wrote an [apology letter.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-sorry-for-pc-chip-delays-but-we-just-cant-meet-demand-for-cpus/) Apple are looking to jump ship and AMD are starting to look like a luxury yacht. [Expect a JUNE 3rd Announcement at Apples Developers conference](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-may-start-selling-macs-with-amd-cpus)

**POINT 3: AMDs THREADRIPPERS ARE SETTING WORLD RECORDS**  

Overclockers are using [threadrippers to clock in 5,548.71MHz.](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3990x-overclocked-at-55-ghz-is-setting-world-records) This is a day after release, with overclockers till continuing to tweak and optimize their rigs. Expect top tier sales from this bad boy from PC geeks worldwide

**POINT 4: AMDs are in BOTH the PS5 and in the XBOX Series X**   

Both console giants are will be utilizing [AMD processors in their consoles](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/could-amd-smartshift-be-the-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-secret-sauce-for-8k-gaming). What else do I have to explain? Its videogames everyone and their uncle is gonna have one.  


**POINT 5: AMD WILL STILL BE RELEASING COMPETITIVE GPUS (BIG NAVI) AND CPUS (ZEN3)**

Rumors of a GPU releasing March 3 (supposedly an RTX2080 TI Killer) have been circulating, we may not see this date but [Su BAE herself has confirmed a 2020 release](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/70025/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-confirms-see-big-navi-2020/index.html).  
[ZEN 3 Architecture was also confirmed by Queen Su](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-zen-3) and will upgrade the company's mobile offering substantially.

END OF POINTS  


Based on all the above, I believe AMD will see tremendous progress as a company and in its stock price. If it can survive any negative corrections, we may never see these prices again. If you want to YOLO on *actual* company doing disruptive things in its industry this is it.  


DISCLAIMER: I don't currently own any positions in AMD all my money is with SATYA for 20/3. I am planning to roll tendies into AMD once I have closed  
I am looking at 

20/6 80c

18/7 80c

LEAPS @ 80c-90c

Historically, they could be viewed as contrasting financial products. Jump into the safety of treasuries when shit hits the fan. Jump into stonks when shit does not hit the fan. For the savants - the good old risk-parity trade. 

This logic since the financial crisis has been negligent, as due to Fed policy (including ZIRP and QE) rates have been artificially held low. We know this. Cool.

Now when you do an overlay comparison between the 10Y Treasury and SPY for the past decade, a significant plunge in rates preceded every significant SPY pullback with the exception of the Vol explosion in Feb 2018. 

However, on a 20 year (weekly) comparison, since the Vol explosion and trade war related volatility in Feb 2018, rates and stonks have been on the most significant divergence of the past decade.

Moreso, on a 5 year (daily) comparison of the 10 Year Treasury and SPY, since late May / early June 2019 when Fed talk of rate cuts really escalated, the divergence in the relationship has been the strongest. 

**What does this mean?**

Treasuries are having record inflows (in part due to Fed policy, foreign sovereign debt yields at negative yields, corona, etc.) while simultaneously stonks are hitting all time highs. Historically, such significant divergences are followed by mean reversion (in this case a short term return to a relatively symmetric relationship). The question becomes, which side is right and which is wrong? 

Is the bond market reasonably pricing in fear or are stonks worthy of all time highs?

**tl:dr: Bond market and stock market are sending different signals. Bond market showing fear, stonk market showing optimism. Is this the final crusade for the bears to officially rise up?**

If she does not, the Defense Department has said **it plans to issue the first “substantive” JEDI task order to Microsoft on Friday.""**

[Source](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/aws-seeks-trump-testimony-in-jedi-cloud-lawsuit/)

If all goes accordingly, headlines will read AWS defeated by Azure. Refocusing attention on Microsoft's profitable and growing cloud business. Not to mention, this is a 10 year deal with openings to new government cloud deals.

***Why is this a big deal?***

From my personal experience in the cloud business, I've worked directly with one of Amazon's subsidiaries on large cloud deals (over 7-figures) in Asia & South America for streaming services that needed low-latency that AWS could not provide due to their datacenter locations. It took our company over 7 months through litigation, red-lines, etc to finalize a contract. One the contract was finished and approved, getting new business can be done in the same day, i.e., once Microsoft is awarded, they can continue growing their government deals as needed, in the same day.

Thus, tomorrow's ruling is a big win (if it happens) for Microsoft.

Update: [the author just posted a new article](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/as-key-jedi-court-decision-looms-pentagon-warns-of-national-security-concerns/)

A few key takeaways:

1. ""...the government argued not only that Amazon lacks the necessarily legal basis to get the temporary stop-work order, issuing one would cause **concrete harm to national security**.""

*Favors MSFT*

2) ""...To win the injunction, among other factors, Amazon needs to show that it’s likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage than the government’s would if the JEDI buildout was paused.""

*Favors MSFT*

3) “While still lacking several key features of the JEDI Cloud…\[DoD\] anticipates a  financial  harm of between $5 and $7 million dollars every month that performance of the JEDI contract is delayed.”

*Nail in the coffin. Case dismissed. MSFT, flawless victory.*

This experience will rely on 5G. The Xbox Series X may play a big role in this because of the following:

What if the weird shape of the Xbox Series X is due to built-in 5G antennas?

To back this speculation up, Microsoft says it’s planning ‘bold’ moves to make you pick the Xbox Series X over Sony’s PS5: [https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/](https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/)

Part of this bold move will assuredly be coupling the Xbox Series X with the xCloud, which is Microsofts cloud-based gaming service and it runs off of Microsoft’s Azure data centers. [https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/)

The Xbox will probably exist as the GPU edgenode for gaming but also a 5G node because the bigger picture above gaming applciations is delivering the software and infrastructure for 5G data distribution. This is Azures purpose.

**Microsoft, Nokia, and 5G**

Remember the US nodding to Nokia and Ericsson for competing with Huawei for 5G [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-12/forget-buying-nokia-the-u-s-has-a-60-billion-huawei-solution](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-12/forget-buying-nokia-the-u-s-has-a-60-billion-huawei-solution)

Well guess who's already partnered up with nokia and a little-known cullular provider for working on 5G?

**Azure and 5G**

Microsoft has been hard at work setting themselves up for this. Remember the JEDI contract?

Well what if JEDI is only the tip of the iceberg? Who cares about one $10B contract with the Department of Defense when 5G-serving wireless carriers are paying you for organizing 5G data distribution?

>Microsoft, Dell, and others are not developing 5G infrastructure hardware. Instead, they are developing a common engineering standard that would allow 5G software developers to run code atop machines that come from nearly any 5G hardware manufacturer. They are developing software and cloud capabilities that will replace a lot of the 5G equipment which is supplied by Huawei.

**TL;DR**

BTFD

Take a look at what happened to Microsoft's share price after 10/26/2019. That was the JEDI contract boom. The share price trend following that date isn't going away any time soon.

I came across the fact that Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia produce over 70% of natural rubber in the world. As well, at least Thailand and Malaysia have started to see the beginnings of outbreak worries & sickness confirmations, which would absolutely wreck them considering their shitty healthcare infrastructure, and thus wreck the material supply for 70% of the world's rubber.

Goodyear Tire hosted their earnings call a couple of days ago, and stated that,  “is not clear what the full impact of the Coronavirus disruption will be,"" when it comes to guiding future quarters.  They have a plant in China, the Goodyear-Pulandia plant. It’s located in the Liaoning province, which is a critical port/shipping spot for China. The plant has been closed for 9 days, soft opened on the 10th, and employees will be “working remote” until the 17th. 

Clearly their inventory will be fucked due to no hands being on deck for half a month (1/6 of a fucking quarter), but that may not be the only worry here...

If the port traffic is down & they aren't receiving raw rubber from the local SE Asian sources due to ***their*** production issues, then things will get much worse from there. China is responsible for 14% of sales & 21% of their operating income as of Jan 2019, & that has only scaled since then. 

The rubber sourcing issue is what I believe was referred to when stated that Coronavirus outlook was, ""not clear.""

You might've read my post yesterday prior to today's court ruling. For those that have short-term calls, sorry for your lost tendies. For those that are holding past March, stay strong -- tendies will be crispy. 

Here's my rational from past ER:

* Microsoft's commercial cloud growth up 39% 
* Office 365 commercial rev growth up 27%
* Windows OEM revenue up 18%. 
* MSFT Divided date: 02/19/20

DD,How much is SPCE actually worth?,32,f3l9po,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3l9po/how_much_is_spce_actually_worth/,57,1581675616.0,"Fellow Autists, here's my garden shed valuation exercise for SPCE. Obviously just my opinion and I could potentially be wrong... lol.  

So what is SPCE? To call it a space company is a vast exaggeration, really it's a company with currently one (eventually three) plastic planes it shoots up about 300k ft into the lower reaches of the Themosphere just past the Karman line, all on a parabolic trajectory so the up to six passengers on board get the illusion of weightlessness for a bit. That's it. It's a luxury *vomit comet* with some fancy marketing. When Morgan Stanley looked at this they supposedly valued this part of the business at 10 bucks for the target price, assuming it's fully operating. If Virgin Galactic were ever to pull off a multi billion dollar development and certification program to develop and bring to market a hyper-sonic point to point transport system, then (probably won't be made from plastic) reportedly, to Morgan Stanley that's worth another 12 bucks... bringing the total value to the well-known 22 dollars per share number. Well what do they know?

Here's my own valuation. Since proper data for SPCE is a bit thin on the ground and it's still loss making lets value operating income (OI). It’s a proxy for operating cash flow ignoring depreciation and taxes, so that's good enough for me for a top line play. We then compare it to a range of other businesses.  

Two real space business: BA (they also build rockets and satellites - incl. software bugs) - I removed the “unusual expense” charge (7,568 mil) related to the MAX debacle, AJRD - they work for NASA and DOJ and have the word “rocket” in thier name, they also do some real estate (why?) but we’ll pretend they don’t. And one cruise company NCLH - (because really whether you go out to sea and return to the same port or get shot up in the air and land at the same port... both are tour operators). NCLH b/c of size and share float, although multiples for RCL, CCL and NCLH are all pretty similar. For NCLH and AJRD used 2018 OI but looking at last 4 quarters it's likely gonna be close to that in 2019. Was gonna include an airline too but most their valuation multiples are even shittier... so cruise lines are the more favorable comp. For SPCE I also favorably assumed that their projected revenue number for 2020 of 31 mil is actually OI. Just to inflate things a bit.

The table below shows the results.  

So that means, even if we apply BA with all its current disasters as the nearest comp, SPCE is still > four times as expensive related to its OI… or at the current price would need to post OI > 130 mil to justify a valuation comparable to BA’s. IF we say our plastic plane/glider company is probably more like a cruise line then it completely falls apart. As you look at the required revenue to justify the current price in the 2020 column keep in mind that Virgin themselves claim 31 Mil are the target for 2020. Don't know whether they mean top line or OI - so let's be charitable and make it OI. They are shooting for 16 flights. 6 pax per flight (at $250k per pax) makes 96 ""guests"", so lets call it 25 Mil revenue from operations. Where the other 6 Mil will come from, who knows? Currently they only have one plane, second one crashed a while back, but another one will start testing this year. Lastly remember even though they got 600 reservations or 80 mil in refundable deposits (read that some place)... under USGAAP accounting those are NOT revenue but liabilities.... I have no doubt SPCE has the potential to become an interesting business but right now we are getting ahead of ourselves with its valuation..  

My conclusion is that in the short run people will of course overpay for jam tomorrow, just as Saint Elon has conditioned us to do, but in the long run SPCE will come back to earth if the numbers keep lacking... so I am going short for now. If I plug the 31 mil OI projection into the “model” I get a target price of $5.50 with BA as a comp. Willing to add $1.50 for hype. So price target is $7.00 - under weight. :P

TL;DR - SPCE is totally overvalued and my cherry picked numbers prove it. Shrug.

**Note:** The date posted is a mistake - it was posted about 5 minutes before this post was.

So this is a fairly major milestone but a lot to go before we make REAL progress.  Quite a few tests which will be done in quick succession and nothing can go wrong there or we going to hurt.  This will hopefully get some syndication from the normies who are all impressed with the word space and commercial.

Not yet convinced how much this will move the stock immediately with the tremendous run-up we have had in recent days -- but it could.  At this point I think the real price moving catalysts would be opening of ticket sales and announcing the date for the first flight.

What do you guys think?  Will this have a positive effect on price or will it be a non-mover?

This supports my DD in the post linked below, however where I said this would be the next step we would see happen and discuss in a bit more detail what I think we can expect.

Virgin have 3/5 of the float still and aren't disposing of any more of their shares while PE is simultaneously trying to grab a stake in it. They're driving the market cap based on the perceived value of Virgin Galactic's tech not the fundamentals. 

It's not going down because close to nobody is fucking selling the thing. You can't even short the underlying because it's flat out impossible to borrow it. There's probably more rally to come as each PE tries to take as much of a stake in it as they can. So fucking quit it with SPCE being memes. PE guys think its worth something and they're putting their money where their mouths are.

Edit: The IV of SPCE options is >100% so calls are really fucking overpriced. Jumping in at this point may not deliver the profits you're expecting but staying on the ride can still probably bring more gains.

Step 3. Figure out what the fuck they do. 

* These shits are REITs, meaning they make a fuck ton of money renting shit out and they pay a fuck ton of money to boomers.

Step 4. Model that shit out.

* Build one of those fancy things or be an autist and call up a researcher
* Get valuation. Fair Value is 290.

Step 5. Google Search trends. People rent this shit by searching for it. More searches = more interest. You think dumbass analyst gonna know next quarter EPS? Bitch, google gonna know.

Step 6. Realize trends are up way fucking higher than these analysts think and their balance sheet is clean.

Step 7. Realize Renaissance Technologies is invested and no matter what due diligence you do, they always fucking right. Plus they bought more (13F came out this morning). We about to be rich. The god of investing in titties bought more shares recently. My ass puts them knowing more about what's going on then my retarded brain does.

Also, Life Storage, which legit full of idiots, who the fuck gonna go to their friends and be like ""Ya I store my grandma's ashes at Life Storage."" With over 162 million square feet of rentable self-storage space, PSA is larger than its next three largest competitors combined.

For those that can’t do math, that’s 14 million purchased at the lowest possible price in the auction.

That means 27 million shares will be released to shareholders in about 2 weeks. $XBIT already dropped over 30% from the tender; it has a lot more to go.

In the year prior to the buyout proposal, $TERP went up over 26%. Since the proposal was announced, $TERP has increased over 30% in just over one month, and has been growing about 1.15% each day since January 28th. If $TERP continues to grow at this rate, and it will, it will be worth $26.26 on March 20th. If you buy $22.5 calls for March 20th today, your return on March 20th will be 1800%. See chart below.

https://imgur.com/a/l2mT24T

Notice the red horizontal line. The only reason $TERP will not continue to rise is due to its earnings report coming out TUESDAY. This company's earnings are consistently shit, but luckily for us, that doesn't mean shit. The most drastic effect a poor earnings report has had on the company in YEARS has been a -8.45% price drop. Worst case Ontario, the report will affect the price this poorly and drop the price on expiry to $23.99, which still results in a 650% return.

tldr: You would have to be a retard to not long $Terp 3/20 $22.5 calls.

Although it is undervalued, there is not enough sentiment to move this up.    

But at the moment, France and Italy are in the push to deploy Nokia Airscale radio access for 5g & 4g/LTE.    

Huawei is now getting annexed and NOK will be filling some of the gaps.

I've lost with NOK in the past due to timing, but I think now we are on the edge of opportunity, I estimate about 2-4 Weeks until NOK starts to get coverage and moves out of its stagnation and into upward momentum.    

I am in because calls are cheap, stock is cheap, and potential future looks promising.

Open interest on Jan 21 2022 , $5 C is 57649. Current premium is $0.62    

My plan for myself and others is obtaining more calls at $5, and obtaining shares.

If you believe otherwise please comment why, I really need counter statements to why I am wrong, this will essentially kill my confidence and allow me to trade a bit safer with less YOLOs.

But I feel I am right about this one again, I have been receiving daily vaccinations and have a healthy diet of adderall and beets.

Even if I am completely wrong, collectively we can be right.

Hear me out.,61,f5jzwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5jzwx/thinking_gme_calls_hear_me_out/,88,1582019862.0,"I initially wanted to short the company, because fuck GameStop, right?  After some review though, I'm actually thinking that buying calls is the better play for 2020.  I know you're thinking it's retarded, and it probably is, but hear me out.

Thesis:

* Selling has been over-done as it is now trading below book value.  Book value per share \~$9 and market cap is under $300M for a company that made over $7B in revenue over the past 12 months.  Granted, their current business model is dying but bankruptcy doesn't seem likely in the near-term,  like many investors seem to be banking on, especially with the PS5 and Xbox2 consoles being released later this year.  Also, see next bullet.

&#x200B;

* Though Moody's downgraded their debt in January, they upgraded their outlook from negative to stable, citing their good liquidity profile among other things ([Source](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-GameStops-CFR-to-B2--PR_417805?WT.mc_id=AM%7eWWFob29fRmluYW5jZV9TQl9SYXRpbmcgTmV3c19BbGxfRW5n%7e20200130_PR_417805&yptr=yahoo)).   The fact of the matter is, the company is still relatively stable from a balance sheet perspective.  They still have an opportunity to right the ship if they play their cards right and switch up their business model as they say they are.

&#x200B;

* Short interest over 100%.  High potential for short squeeze.  It would just take one piece of positive news.  For example, if they were to close the poor performing stores, they could report a better than expected same-store sales next earnings.  Don't believe me?  The dumpster fire company Sears' reported increased same-store sales in their 2018 Q3 earnings ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/shoppers-return-to-liquidating-sears-stores-boost-same-store-sales.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)), which sent the stock price up like 20% if I remember correctly due to the short squeeze.  It was a slightly misleading stat as the company was still destined for bankruptcy at that point, but it was enough for investors to find hope.

&#x200B;

* The company's near-term future is dependent largely on the upcoming PS5 and Xbox2 releases.   
 The company is expecting sales to increase significantly with their releases and I don't think that is priced in yet mostly because neither console has an official release date set yet.  At the moment, both have been confirmed by Sony and Microsoft to be released in time for the holiday 2020 season.  If either company announces an official release date, that should give investors more confidence in GameStops' future sales/earnings and potentially leading to a short squeeze.
   * Supposedly, Sony is said to have an event in March, with press invites potentially going out in late February, that could be when they provide more details and dates ([Source](https://bgr.com/2020/02/04/ps5-release-date-announcement-event-scheduled-for-march/)).

I'm thinking June/July 2020 $4.5 or $5 calls to allow time for news to come out.  I'm not really interested in GameStop long term, but I think it's under-valued at the moment.  Thoughts?",2020-02-18 04:57:42

They have a 86% of revenues coming from services which they make 80% gross margins on and a 70%+ gross margin overall even counting the physical textbook business which is also going more online too so margins should be getting better there as well. With record number of students in college wasting their money on english degrees, and a low monthly payment of 15 bucks a month. I dont see any student cancelling their subscription they probably dont pay for when it helps get them degrees which can run for hundreds of thousands of dollars. They also deliver you textbooks for cheaper and give you access online to a lot of them which should actually save most students money. They havent even tried expanding internationally past some English speaking countries (Canada, england and australia). Relatively small market cap of under 5b so wsb could actually have an underlying impact if we get it trending. Discloser i own shares, have gotten calls in the past and will likely buy some calls this week. 4/17 or 7/17 $45 is what im looking at. IV is pretty reasonable with RH saying its mod 30s.

Edit: should probably mention their service is  subcription based for all their homework help which is incredibly popular to a lot of students on campuses. For any of you in college you will know what i mean",2020-02-17 21:57:23

DD,DD: Predicting a Stock Leap,149,f62ru8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f62ru8/dd_predicting_a_stock_leap/,40,1582104349.0,"I wanted to share my thoughts on why I think we've been seeing these recent huge gains and a possible way to capitalize on them.

**The Motivation**
 
I too am trying to become a rich fellow autist, just like you. Usually, I'm late to the meme stock party and miss out on profits. So, I thought to myself ""If I can think of the similarities between these companies, maybe I can beat the crowd and make some real r/wsb front page worthy shit.""^^hopefully ^^as ^^gains
  
**The Baseline Stock**

As my first stock of analysis, of course, I took the latest meme stock $SPCE, Virgin Galactic. Founder Richard Branson is a multi-billionaire with the proper financial backings to make a company huge. But, I figured that is not enough drive for even the newest of new investors to buy calls/shares in the masses and the stock price to soar. With a quick background check, you could find that Branson tried sending tourists to space back in 2008. [\[ref\]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7529978.stm) He even said he had over 250 people prepaid for $200,000 each. If that happened today, the stock would have probably rocketed to another dimension. 
  
Even better, the market $SPCE is entering isn't controlled by a single company, leaving room for huge growth and a market with gigantic potential. Fox already reported this hype that the space market is projected to reach upwards of $1 trillion. This was even before Virgin Galactic took off in December, albeit this market cap projection included weather, Wi-Fi, shipping and logistics, television and radio rely on satellite-based services. [\[ref\]](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/space-trillion-dollar-economy) This could be a factor.
  
**Past Trends Analysis**

It seems, especially nowadays, *hype* drives certain stocks through the roof. Even the slight thought of a company having a massive market cap leads to a huge response from investors. No news becomes good news for the company and good news creates huge share volumes. Most recently, $SPCE and $TSLA bulled their way to daily gains at unimaginable rates without much concrete news. Some meme stocks mentioned here do well ($AMD, $MSFT), those <10% daily gains have some premise, having solid financials to back it up. But, they do not demonstrate extreme leaps like $SPCE who hasn't even made a penny (since I'm Canadian, I should say a Nickel instead). To strengthen my original reasoning, I needed to think of other stocks that had this situation. Then, it all started to come together...

* $SPCE - Sub-orbital tourism/travel. [+320% in 2 1/2 months](https://imgur.com/a/2ODk0X7)
* $TSLA - The BEV vehicle with a bonus of technology and renewable energy market? Close enough of a guess, but who cares because it went [+270% in 4 months](https://imgur.com/a/RMhHzCa)
* $ACB^^RIP - Legal weed hype. Canada legalizing marijuana. [+376% in just over 2 months](https://imgur.com/a/gBILaZd)
* $BYND - Vegetarian ""meat"" market. Blew up [+255% in merely 2 1/2 months](https://imgur.com/a/dit7tmY)
* $NFLX - Online mass video streaming market. [+114% in 6 months] (https://imgur.com/a/gkhjCLT)  
* Though this is not a stock, Bitcoin investments when it was seemingly the first kind of major form of cryptocurrency was insane. [+2,390% in 1 year.](https://imgur.com/a/7yU03hK) I'd call this an outlier but I don't know anything about the market so maybe another will happen. 

This is a list of stocks I can think of, irrelevant of their revenue, that showed the best of best short term gains and all had that similarity. 

**Ahead of the Party**

If I want to get ahead of these parties I need to pick the $BYND or the $SPCE @ $8 before it runs up a 89.9° incline. Finding a company that has the potential to completely enter and control a market, without any actual revenue history. That's where this prediction comes in: $DEAC. 
  
*The market:* Major sports betting on the US market is not yet available and this acquisition corporation plans to change that by merging with DraftKings. [\[ref\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-23/draftkings-is-going-public-in-deal-valuing-firm-at-3-3-billion) Before this merger was made public, CNBC wrote a huge article on the sports betting, including a market projection of $150 billion (the estimated current illegal gambling market size). DraftKings and FanDuel own 83% of the legal gambling market in New Jersey. [\[ref\]] (https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/fanduel-draftkings-race-to-win-150-billion-sports-betting-market.html) This leads to a massive potential upside in having an IPO in the sports betting industry, projected to be $5 billion dollars. 

*The opportunity:* $DEAC is an acquisition corporation meant exactly for this purpose. They plan to merge with DraftKings and change to a publicly-traded DraftKings. Not only is the market projected to be large, but this deal is also said to be priced in at a market cap of $3.3 billion. By the way, $DEAC is currently at an $840 million market cap. Now... I'm no mathematician, but those numbers are definitely far apart.

*The challenge:* While a supreme court ruling allowed any state their own legalization ability for sports betting, I believe NYC just turned down daily sports fantasy betting again. It most likely will be appealed but state legalization it is something to keep in mind. Currently, it shows 21 states have DFS regulations. [\[ref\]](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/daily-fantasy-sports-blocked-allowed-states/) Tax incentives could be a push for the other states to follow and legalize DFS regulations.
  
**Conclusion/TLDR**

There's one thing in common with these huge gaining stonks, *They are breaking through to a market that's yet to be controlled*. I'm not a millionaire yet, nor I may never be, but the potential upside of a $DEAC investment seems like a great way to make people millionaires, *cough cough* calls. 


May the gains be with you all!",2020-02-19 04:25:49
DD,HSBC puts,10,f6256e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6256e/hsbc_puts/,11,1582101735.0,"Hello autists,

HSBC is planning to lay off 35,000 staff.

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/c0095f40-5203-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f

Basically they cite Winnie the Flu and the riots in HK as cutting into their profits, soooo they’re gonna fire 35k people. 

Now I’ll be honest with you, I’m kind of retarded, so don’t listen to me. But I remember watching this guy who actually made money trading on the news, and he said to short Deutsche Bank because “banks can’t shrink themselves to profitability”, or something like that. Look it up, it was a meme. Anyways, it seems to me that this is what HSBC is trying to do, shrink themselves to profitability. Idk why that it doesn’t work for banks, but there is that smart guy who says so. For what it’s worth, look at DB’s stock over the last few years, it tanked 

My second but if DD is the fact that coronavirus and the HK riots have been relatively recent, 2019 only, and so you wouldn’t think that they are going to affect HSBC so bad that they have to lay off nearly 10% of their work force. 

What makes this especially surprising in HSBC are HQ’d in Asia, and that’s where the flu n riots n shit is going on, but these job loses are going to be focused in Europe and America, not where the world’s economy has been hit hardest.",2020-02-19 03:42:15

EPS estimate is $.60/share which is pretty much the same as a year ago, meaning no growth. Judging from past earnings reports estimates are typically pretty accurate and I could see them even achieving a small beat.

My bearish sentiment on this stock is that the restaurants under this banner are intrinsically tied to shopping malls (many anchored by Macy's stores which will be closing) which are getting destroyed by online retail.

I spent a lot of time doing this research last night and wanted to share it all with you since I don't even think most of the market has noticed it.
  
TGI Fridays went public in 1983 but then was taken private in 1989.  The company was bought out by TriStar Capital last year.
  
TGI is merging with a SPAC, ticker ALGR.
  
ALGR has warrants - the warrant exercise price is $11.50.  The current share price of ALGR is $10.24.  We can see that it wouldn't be difficult for it to get to the $11.50 price.  Well, the warrants are .23 cents, currently.
  
**The ticker for the warrant is ALGRW**
  
I've done a lot of DD on this.  Here's some press articles I found that are worth reading:
  
https://www.fsrmagazine.com/chain-restaurants/tgi-fridays-go-public-after-380m-deal
  
http://archive.is/A9l82
  
^ The company is redoing all of it's bars in hopes of drawing in more customers.  TGI does $2B in franchise sales per year.  This current deal values the company at just $380M, which prices it at 1/4 it's yearly revenue from franchise fees.
  
ALGR extended the shareholder meeting to March 31st, 2020 to allow 'further time to consummate the deal.""

My thought is that once the merger is completed, this is going to be hyped up on CNBC, much like SPCE has been.  I was in the SPCE warrants at $2.  Sadly, I sold them at $4.
  
I don't see much risk here.  The warrants don't expire for 5 YEARS.

DD,Dish Network - 2/19/2020 BMO (Bearish),9,f5w6rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f5w6rw/dish_network_2192020_bmo_bearish/,9,1582079007.0," 

**Stock: DISH Networks (DISH)**

**Direction:** **Neutral Bearish**

**Price Target:** **40$**

**Type:** Call Credit Spread

**Fundamental:** Dish is currently in transition to a wireless play from their traditional hardware cable business. While its current in a downtrend, long term debt is high compared to cash on hand. In addition, DISH requires a massive 10-15 Billion worth of cash to complete its 5G dreams. While they can generate funding through banks and potential partnerships with large tech companies, it is still a very uphill battle.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving average, with visible lower volume since last earnings; a spike in volume during the Sprint + Tmobile merger announcement. MACD shows bearish divergence. RSI shows around 75, overbought. Options sentiments are very bearish in volume and bearish in open interest. Implied movement of about 8.9% or 3.61$.

**Sentimental**: Dish has been on a decline due to the rising popularity of streaming. However, with the merger of Sprint and TMUS, Dish is positioning themselves to become a 5G leader with their telecom towers and proposed new investments. This can optically revitalize the company’s image, but the logistics and capital requirements are very high and not clear enough.

**ROI: 23%**

**Risk Level: 3 out of 5, Risky**

**Sell: 2/28 44$ Call, Buy 2/28 45$ Call**  
The crux of this play is based on technical and option volume/OI sentiments. Due to the recent optimism surrounding Dish's upcoming role in the telecom space, especially due to their spectrum assets, DISH stock has jumped to the 40$ range. However, short term realities will weigh heavily on DISH in this transition period and will require DISH to show process in its ambitious 5G plans.

The wildcard would be additional updates on progress of their 5G transition. This would have a bullish and unpredictable affect on the stock price.",2020-02-18 21:23:27

From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don’t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.

China today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).

Chinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that’s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.

In December 2019, a Moody’s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China’s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.

This was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering “high yield products” to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, “because the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.” This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.

This is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron’s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:

>One area, in particular, is back at the forefront—local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities—China’s top two schools—found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.

>Put another way, 85% of China’s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.

[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China’s exposure to the world economy. I’m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:

>In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China’s] total GDP growth.

>In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.

While 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&P 500’s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don’t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon’s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.

All of this comes on top of Boeing’s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China’s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. 

In addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.

To summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing’s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.

TL;DR: China’s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing’s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I’m not saying we’re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.

TL;DR 2: Puts on semiconductors and Apple",2020-02-18 17:15:15

Looking for some air fried, delicious tendies?? Well guess what, it's time to get off your collectives, and divert your 401Ks and FAFSA student loans into $WORK. Make $WORK, $WORK for you. It's a sure thing. Here's why: 

Why $WORK? Because $WORK is Slack. Slack is messenger poised to take over communication as we know it. No longer will organizations rely on emails as the chosen method of communication, Slack is an organizational messaging and knowledge base tool which today, has been adopted as the communications model of choice for several fortune 500 companies. Including IBM. And the list is grooooowwwwing. 

So today, before the market opens know that the opportunity exists to be part of the inception of how we communicate personally, and in our corporate lives, and either hold the stock or be a part of elevating $WORK to the MOON. 

You want those sweet sweet honey mustard covered tendies? You got to put in your $WORK. Looking for a sure fire return? Long $WORK calls. Need to recover from SPCE and MSFT? $WORK

I'm telling you autists, you're going to regret it when you're salty, crying over your burnt tendies when all you had to do was put in (call) a little $WORK.

DD,Fed Repo Operations - First Draft,42,f6njq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6njq8/fed_repo_operations_first_draft/,38,1582201523.0,"So I've been wanting to do this for a while and finally sat down and did some work on it tonight.

I've been curious about the Fed Repo operations for a while - I initially was operating under the incorrect assumption that each repo amounted to a cash infusion to the market. It's not, and in retrospect it's ridiculous to assume that the fed is giving away 60B in free money every day (in exchange for treasuries and MBS).

What they actually appear to be doing is giving out what amounts to short term loans to banks so those banks can meet liquidity requirements. Each of these 'loans' or repo operations has a deal date (when the deal was struck) and a maturity date (when I'm assuming the Fed needs to get its money back from the banks involved in the deal).

A lot of the repo operations are 1 day deals meaning that repayment is required the next day, but not all of them. Actually a lot are 7 day deals or 14 day deals. This means that the fed has been running a negative balance ever since these repos started.

I decided to try and calculate what that running balance is and below are my results:

https://preview.redd.it/le2jwcl490i41.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f6f9c41f7a1079db5cb5daa016bc7761b82bc88

Numbers are in billions. Red line is total amount submitted (by the banks, meaning how much they requested - see [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-repo-overnight/ny-fed-accepts-all-73-5-bln-bids-submitted-at-overnight-repo-operation-idUSL2N2720IE)), blue line is total amount accepted (by the fed). Note the big discrepancy over the last week and a half.

This is just a first take and doesn't include reverse repos which I believe are when the fed accepts money from banks, overall these don't seem to be as common as regular repos and aren't for as large amounts.

Data source: [https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-search-page](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-search-page)

Analysis:

I'm not going to post my code (yet) but essentially what I did is for every date, calculate which repos were 'active' (meaning they had been agreed upon prior to the date and hadn't reached maturity yet, meaning the fed still hadn't gotten their money back) and add up the values of 'total submit' and 'total accept'.

Again, this is a first analysis and I'm not sure that any of this is accurate so take it with a grain of salt. If there's anyone who has more knowledge about this I'd be happy to discuss this and redo the analysis.

Edit #4:

I know correlation isn't causation... but... for fucks sake

Sad you missed out on the SPCE train? Me too, but get off your ass and stop whining. We have another chance to moon: Rite Aid is our next tendie train. Yes, I’m talking about the glorified liquor store that got fucked in the ass after the failed Walgreens merger a few years ago. 
            But things have changes. The old CEO John Standley who was a boomer douchebag that basically actively sabotaged the company and brought it from $180+ per share to penny stock status. But management had been changed with sexy CEO mommy Heyward Donigan two quarters ago and also a new COO. During Heyward’s first quarter, the company was already showing that it was rebuilding strength. It’s EPS improved and beat expected by 47.33%. Last quarter’s ER, they beat the $0.15 expected EPS by 261.47% with $0.54 actual. The stock price surged from $7-8 a share to $23.88 in a week. However, profit-taking, gay bears and short ers took tanked it, but RAD found a new support level at around $12. 
           Listening to the last earnings call, the company has very good guidance. They are planning to expand their digital platforms and other services. From the ER call: “We’ve seen the benefit of Rite Care in our business, in our third quarter results, which reflect growth in ancillary immunization of more than 47%, which is outpacing the competition.” Also, “digital sales have been growing over the past few quarters, with a 69% increase in Q3, driven by digital refills. They’ve also released Rite Aid branded ice cream, which has been huge success.
           There are going to a couple catalysts coming within the next month and a half. On March 16th, Rite Aid will be hosting an Analyst Day. During the conference call, they’ve repeatedly refused to answer some questions with the reason that they are saving it for Analyst Day. Must be good news. Earnings is on April 9th, which I am expecting to be huge. The sell-off last quarter after the earnings rally was because people were not fully confident that RAD could deliver consistently. But this ER will be bigly for the company. The last few months, the stock was struggling to break the $13 resistance. Last Thursday, it smashed into $15 before falling back to $14. It’s about to smash through $15 again today. RAD to $30 as soon as it gets moving.
*****Alright here comes the fun part.
This stock has a 36% short interest. There is massive potential for a short squeeze. The market cap is fucking tiny, at 743 million. Here is an opportunity for us to pump the fuck out of this company. A market cap thats 5x less than SPCE means 5x more tendies and options are dirt cheap at the moment. Also, coronavirus panic + pharmacy stock = tendies. The daily volume on RAD has been picking up lately. The price spreads on 4/17 calls are enormous. Guess which fucking stock had huge spreads right before it mooned? TESLA. Yes you heard it here first, RAD is the new Tesla.

TLDR: ALL IN ON RAD FOR RADICAL TENDIES. Give it the good ol’ WSB pump, get on the train before it leaves you with only FOMO tendies. 3/20 or 3/27 calls to play Analyst Day on 3/16 and 4/16 calls to play the earnings on 4/9

If the beer virus doesn't tank the market this is freest money you will ever see. Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on three companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:

https://i.imgur.com/lSB6Psm.png

Global Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US. Though Samsung did just recently win over Qualcomm, they will be splitting this deal with TSMC. Samsung also sells chips to IBM, but those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes, not for consumers. Samsung mostly focuses on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is in a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the world's largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Literally can't go tits up. Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earnings on April 16th and option prices are ripe. Go get them tendies boiz.

In short, TSMC splitting QCOM 5nm with Samsung. TSMC locked in 5nm A14 Bionic for AAPL, 7nm Big Navi for AMD, and 7nm Ampere for NVDA. They are also expanding rapidly to meet the rising global demand for chips. PS5 and Xbox Series X chips are also produced by them. They are selling chips faster than they can make them.

Edit: Forgot to mention Huawei is about to surpass Apple to become TSMCs biggest customer. Also TSMC and Global Foundries were in a patent feud for a while that was locking both companies up. They have decided to call a patent truce and won't have to worry about any restrictions for the next decade.

After this was announced, KR went from trading at 28.40~ to as high as 30.70 on Tuesday when the market opened. Full transparency, I hold positions at 30C for 2/28 and 30.5C for 3/13 that I purchased at near market cost on Tuesday.

While I could've flipped my 30C calls I purchased on Tuesday for as high as a 1,600% return at one point, that wouldn't be true WSB fashion because I'm here for the huge gains, right? Well, after doubling up on my position today when it dipped to as low as $0.24 for the 30C options, I'm prepped for the rebound after this dip to 29.54 today.

This coupled with their Expected EPS of 0.56 (up from 0.47) to be reported on 3/5 is looking to make some big tendies in the week leading up to EPS pre-market. I'm sure the 2/28 30C will be shooting up pretty high from their current dip in anticipation for that.

I'm feeling good about this because I've held NVDA through the dip to 232 and saw the gains through 290C, not that that has any relation really but the gut hasn't failed me yet. Plus, this is a Wendy's.",2020-02-20 01:18:17

This sector tailwind has boosted Zillow’s price nearly 2X in the span of less than 6 month. Zillow’s home flipping segment, while generating additional losses, has completely revitalized the revenue growth story. However, a concern is the revenue recognition method, which calculates the wholly flipped house sold price as revenue, rather than the incremental cash earned. Fishy, but not that fishy, as a secondary margin KPI tracker can be used to supplement this revenue methodology.

**Sentimental**: Redfin recently spiked off a very strong earnings with narrower losses and increased revenue. The stock shot up even after a strong quarter of price growth. Zillow here is expected to follow the same pattern, with potential to short squeeze due to 15% short float. The downside would be missing expectation and lower guidance, though I doubt management will let that narrative happen.

We're dumb as rocks, armed with margin and options approval levels that nobody in their right minds should grant a 12 year old.

So, how do we use this? We aggregate our tiny, limp sticks into one large, girthy one, and fly this motherfucker to the moon.

You see this over and over again across the history of WSB - we've lifted SNAP, PCG, AMD, and many others up from the depths of hell and into meme glory.

Here's your next ticker - OSTK.

Let's make one thing perfectly clear - this is an amazing stock. They have been crushed by Wayfair, to the point where founder and [ex-CEO Patrick Byrne has fallen completely off the rails into deep state conspiracies and crypto nutter-hood.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/19/overstocks-former-ceo-sells-off-his-m-stake-saying-hes-worried-about-deep-state/)

That's not an exaggeration - in late August of last year, Patrick finally released his inner autist and went on an absolutely epic rant during a conference call, then abruptly [submitted his resignation in a, quite frankly, selfless display of insanity and Q-anon levels of paranoia](https://www.deepcapture.com/2019/09/a-message-to-my-former-colleagues-at-overstock/).

Here's where we profit: Patrick still believes in the company. In his memo, he specifically notes his ""war chest"" of safe assets - crypto and commodities, both of which are up substantially, which he is committed to using to support the company via the purchase of stock on the open market.

""In fact, you will have not just access to capital, you will have access to the friendliest capital imaginable: my own. I have to wait six months for it to be legal, but anytime after March 17, 2020 I can provide a capital injection (if needed) by buying back into Overstock. Please remember that as you watch the global chaos. If you see the US economy cratering please do not lose the sleep you otherwise might: you will have a friend who has sunk (almost) his entire fortune into investments that will soar if a crisis occurs, and who knows your business well, and who appreciates you.""

March 17, 2020. A little under a month away and this crazy motherfucker is buying back in, and buying with conviction. April 03 calls will capture both their next ER, which should show a still-profitable business, and Patrick starting to accumulate stock again.

Stock: **Dropbox**

Direction: **Neutral**, Monster Bullish

**Price Target:** **18$, 22$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread, Call Debit spread**

**Fundamental:** As one of the old unicorns of silicon valley, Dropbox is in a bad place due to its lack of product moat in an increasingly competitive industry. However, DBX does sport one of the lowest PE ratios within the sector, leading to some value buyers eyeing the stock. DBX is somewhere in the muddy waters between Growth and Fundamental, and this can lead to some outsized price action.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, below 200 day MA.  MACD shows neutral convergence. RSI shows around 55, slightly above neutral. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement of about 12.3% or 2.27$.

**Sentimental**: Dropbox recently released its new product end of last quarter. This new product aims to smooth over some of Dropbox’s lagging technology and services. While a revenue re-acceleration was started last quarter, the increased cost on marketing, sales, and transition may affect earnings perception. Dropbox has a history of beating earnings; it also has a history of sliding after earnings. **This one is quite risky, and a bullish call is considered contrarian**. 

**ROI: 28%, 300%**

**Risk Level: 5 out of 5, 50/50**  
**I suggest the put credit spread. This overall play is much more risky, but also a very interesting case of growth vs fundamentals.**

DD,Peloton: a bull's case for puts,8,f6vgrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6vgrj/peloton_a_bulls_case_for_puts/,5,1582244684.0,"After reading r/4thebadbone's [case for calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6mikp/peloton_interactive_incoming_tendies/) on yuppie cult company Peloton (PTON:US), I felt the need to make a counterargument, despite the risk of being further castigated as a bear.  

• First and foremost: the company's [IPO lockup period expires next week on 02/23](https://investor.onepeloton.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001639825-20-000008). There's been some confusion around this: on paper, it's scheduled for 03/23. If you read the fine print, however, the terms surrounding this means that it will *actually* occur on 02/23. This means that 317 million shares will be up for sale 02/24. Given that the company continues to sell below its $29.00 IPO price, one can imagine a short squeeze followed by a massive sell-off from institutional holders who no longer see PTON as a value investment. Retail YOLO investors aside, what happens when supply exceeds demand? Price goes down, that's what. And while some might see that as a prime opportunity to buy the dip on a meme stock that Wall Street is exceptionally bearish on (112% of float was shorted before earnings earlier this month. NASDAQ isn't showing the short interest for February, but I doubt it's dropped that much if at all), the big players seem to think otherwise. 

• Although PTON enjoys a cult following, they've undercut the necessity of their bikes: the major source of their income. The Peloton app, which livestreams classes or plays pre-recorded classes, is compatible with *any* exercise bike. As [Citron Research](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Citron-Research-Presents-Peloton-Investors-Pedaling-Themselves-into-Frenzy.pdf) points out:

""...with the Peloton digital app a customer can pay $12.99 for the same connected experience without having to pay $2,245 for the bike. Peloton justifies this by saying the app is a lead gen source yet the company admits that less than 10% of digital subscribers end up purchasing a connected fitness product.""  

Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for ~~free~~ $12.99?  

• That said, PTON's price point is hardly competitive in a consumer market that, understanding the value proposed by at-home-but-still-social exercise, is producing similar products at much lower costs to consumers. PTON may see some advantage in B2B sales, but at the end of the day, it's still an overpriced stationery bike (and treadmill). 

• r/4thebadbone points out that Peloton recently won its lawsuit against Flywheel. That is not, however, the end of Peloton's legal troubles: they're also looking at a [$300M lawsuit brought by music publishers claiming copyright infringement] (https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8531541/nmpa-300-million-peloton-copyright) as well as another lawsuit against a competitor.  

Whether or not lockup actually floods the market with PTON shares remains to be seen. What also remains to be seen is PTON's long-term value as a company. Stonks may only go up, but some take a Hell of a lot longer than others: it doesn't help when they're riding bikes that don't go anywhere instead of electric cars that are heading towards Mars.",2020-02-20 19:24:44

Ok now that the FOMOsexuals have ran back to r/all and r/investing, let's talk Dunkin Donuts. TL;DR buy AAPL 4/17 $450 calls and AMD calls too because the market is too dumb to understand the difference between a GPU and CPU.  
   
If you listened to [anything anywhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/c5kcwl/apple_has_hired_arms_lead_cpu_architects_mike/) ever these past two years then you know that AAPL is moving away from shintel for CPUs and are about to unveil their [new in-house ARM chips](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/apple-is-said-to-plan-move-from-intel-to-own-mac-chips-from-2020), which is going to both drive down costs of chips+shipping, logistics and unpacking and shit etc and increase profits due to stealing market share from Intel. In addition, AAPL's attempt to short their own stock this past week failed because everyone knows coronavirus only kills Chinese Boomers and none of them have iPhones anyway. By middle of March nobody will even remember coronavirus and nobody will give a fuck about AAPL's guidance because retards care more about the future and things they can't see (see SPCE). AAPL is going to break 500 by May and hit 800 by EOY.
  
Anyway on to AMD. I see a lot of retards here thinking that AAPL is going to move to AMD for CPUs for some deluded, senseless, retarded reason. That reason is because they heard the same thing from some other autistic retard, because that other autist thought that a GPU is a CPU and they saw some news about AAPL switching to AMD, and none of those retards know that [has been priced in since 2017](https://investorplace.com/2017/06/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-gets-the-nod-from-apple-inc-aapl/) when AAPL switched to AMD GPU's.

Let's get some shit out in the clear first. The way forward for gaming is **game streaming** by game streaming I mean cloud gaming services like Googles Stadia.
* First of all **Why?**
* Hardware is expensive in gaming. Like very expensive consider your gaming pc a good high end gaming pc can easily be worth in excess of several *thousand* dollars which is often an upfront cost most casual gamers *cannot afford to cough up* anddd most importantly if the latest games keep getting more intensive on ram and cpu you will need to upgrade it eventually anyway. This means that any cloud gaming service like Nvidia's GEFORCE NOW which is free for an hour of gaming before you need to relog or for roughly 5 pounds a month you can play with decent fps on almost any steam game (something which stadia doesn't allow you to do and is more expensive with an even smaller game pool to play on). Even if you have a MAC you can play steam games which is huge for the gaming market in general.
* **What does this mean for my AMD tendies?**
Basically AMD doesn't have a streaming service able to compete with Geforce Now. Geforce now has been in apply only beta for **3 fucking years already** and has accumulated 1 million users  before it went free for everyone to access use provided they queue for available slots on the service (if they have a free account that is (you starting to see the hook and draw tactic Nvidia is playing here?)). Amd is literally stuck in the past making hardware plays whilst Nvidia storms ahead in the game streaming market. Who cares if AMD is hooking up with Apple for a swanky new Mac if people wouldn't need to upgrade to said swanky new Mac cuz their getting their gaming and other capabilities on their old Mac's using Geforce Now. 

* **Okay I hear you, most people don't buy Mac's for gaming anyway**
But... amd is fundamentally a graphics card company and if you look at it in the perspective of a games streaming service such as Nvidias which already had a massive user base BEFORE it went public and easy to access. The growth potential on Nvidia rn is crazy. 
* **So now that Geforce NOW has gone free and easily accessible how are the average consumers reacting?**
Okay firstly there isn't a lot of statistics for this out yet considering Nvidia has only just fully released it from beta two weeks ago. However, whilst playing recently it has been impossible to miss a **sharp rise in people talking about and using geforce now in game** the ability to play any game regardless of your pc and only requiring a good internet speed (see starlink for any doubters that this will hold geforce now back) is too amazing to pass up on. The average user if they get the 5pound subscription will only spend like 60 bucks a year on Geforce Now compared to the 1000 they would have to spend to upgrade their pc. Also the versatility of geforce now is frankly scary. Consider playing games on ur phone,  TV, or anything for that matter. All u need is a good internet speed.
* **In summary** for this section is suspect geforce now is going through a period of **rocket** growth **you heard it here first** keep an eye on Q2 and Q3 NVDA to see whether or not they start talking about the potential there. Amd is legit getting slept on here I'm telling u
* ----------------------
* **TLDR** NVDA is developing a Netflix of cloud game streaming that AMD is sleeping on and is UNDERCUTTING and OUTPERFORMING and quite honestly probably out selling google stadia. With 1 million beta users before going publicly available the growth potential is huge. **BUY NVDA longs at NVDA bottom and hold for YEAR END.**

Several analysts maintained their current ratings on the stock ahead of the expiration, with **two reaffirming bullish stances.** There can be pressure shares in the near-term with a rough estimate of 277M shares unlocked. About half is held by affiliated shareholders and other half by non-affiliates. 

**GOOD NEWS :** 

1) Analysts at **JPMORGAN, MKM PARTNERS, WEDBUSH** and **SUNTRUST** all maintain a positive outbreak in 2020.  

2) Flywheel admits fault and makes settlement. ([https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/peloton-wins-suit-against-flywheel-copying](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/peloton-wins-suit-against-flywheel-copying)) This means that Peloton is offering Flywheel subscribers to join them and get a refurbished Peloton Bike at no cost. There is an estimate that we can easily add 100,000 more subscribers.

3) This stock’s RSI is at 34.69 which is a good RSI score suggesting this stock is neither overbought or oversold.

4) Don't doubt **BECKYS**. ( I had 14,000 shares of LULU back in 2012 and sold it in 2014 at a loss due to betting on BECKYS. )

They are currently the only FDA backed company that is approved to use Cannabidiol(CBD) for their product this is not your ACB, and your Tilray shit they do not manufacture flowers and buds they actually sell literal CBD medicine.

**WTF is this company BRUH?**

They manufacture  Epidiolex the only FDA approved to treat severe cases of Epilepsy using CBD extract in the US and to some European countries.

**What else do they do boi?**

They also manufacture SativeX to treat muscle spasm caused by Multiple Sclerosis(MS) and its currently gaining traction. It is currently being used in 30 countries I believe it is in the preliminary stage for FDA approval.

**Tell me more.**

They are currently making a study if they can use  Cannabidivarin(CBDV) to cure all of us for our Autism this is big if true. There's going to have a cure for us. Hold on to your tendies.

**Hows the financial though BRUH?**

Currently, they are slated to lose 52c per share, but in 2018 they are reported to have lost 2.35 per share during the same quarter. That is a 79% share improvement from the previous year by the way they are reporting Q4 and Q1 on Tuesday (2/25)

“It’s an incredible launch year for any medication \[that\] I think proves that this kind of medicine is really making a difference to patients,” GW Pharma CEO Justin Gover said after selling $296 million worth of Epidiolex in 2019.

**What's** **the target price for this BRUH?**

The consensus target price for this company is $204 we are currently at $125 we are still 39% away from it we still have plenty of runways.

**But what's the big jump from 2018 to 2019?**

The reason for the big jump is that the approval of FDA for Epidiolex and they are finally able to commercialize and sell their product in the US.

**My position:** 150c 3/20

First, my condolences for your wrecked profiles on this bloody Friday but it's time to get in the green boys.

IMAX shares are down over $2.25 this month and that is RIGHT AFTER they beat earning expectations this week. After the announcement, shares rose 4% and went up to $17.30. Buy in now, it's already back to being sub $17 and all of their Chinese locations are closed right now thanks to Corunna (which is over half their total theaters). How do you think those earnings are going to look next earnings report? Here a blip from their earning reports earlier this week:

*""As it pertains to our business, the safety of our employees and Chinese audiences remains our top priority. IMAX China and IMAX Corporation strongly supported the decision to postpone the release of the Chinese New Year film slate and closure of the theaters across the country. Since January 24, more than 70,000 screens, including all of our IMAX screens in Mainland China, have been temporarily closed. We believe it was the best course of action in an unfortunate situation.""*

Oof. 70,000 screens closed currently? That cannot possibly be good for business, yet somehow the stock hasn't dipped very harshly yet. In person experiences such as theaters have the most to lose from this outbreak.

June 19 puts all cheap at a $15 strike price of 0.60. Get in while the getting is good because this stock is not going to the moon, it is going to the Mariana Trench while our bank numbers go to space.

DD,SHORT $MDLA THROUGH LOCKUP AND INTO Q4,16,f7ceoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7ceoo/short_mdla_through_lockup_and_into_q4/,9,1582326615.0,"Core reasons to short Medallia over the next 3-6 months. 

MDLA is a top of the range CX enterprise software business that has been operating for over 20 years. Although the product is extremely sophisticated and useful, it takes a significant amount of time and capital to integrate it once a business has chosen to use the software. They target the larger enterprises and yearly contract values can go into the 7 figures. 

* Recently both Qualtrics and Survey Monkey have been moving up market with far cheaper (yet less sophisticated) customer experience and survey solutions. Survey Monkey enterprise business now has over 6k customers and is growing 145% as of Q4 2019. 

* Medallia organic revenue growth has been slowing significantly despite management commentary around ""accelerating growth"". The company has been making several acquisitions that are adding several percentage points to growth despite management commentary that their revenue contribution is ""negligible"". 2020 organic growth should be below 20% for the first time ever. 

* Medallia has not been profitable in 20 years and its mid term target of profitability looks unrealistic. The company window dressed its profitability into the IPO using accounting shenanigans to convince shareholders it was on a strong path to profitability. EBIT margins straight after the IPO reversed back to negative.  

* Medallia diluted shares outstanding are higher than most sell side analysts are quoting due to stock options and RSUs. If you use the treasury stock method, MDLA is trading on 13x revenue and is only growing mid to low 20%.

* 6X the free float or 108m shares have become available to trade since mid January and CEO has already sold almost $10m of his shares. Other insiders have dumped substantial parts of their holdings including founders.

* Peer Survey Monkey is trading at 7.5x revenue, where growth is actually accelerating towards mid 20%s and the company is generating at least $40m of free cash flow per year. 

Q4 could be a catalyst for the stock to re rate lower, if it begins to trade even at a premium to SVMK at 9-10x sales the stock easily has 30% downside from here.",2020-02-21 18:10:15

AMRN main competitors have have given up development or have shown their products to be no more effective than a placebo. g_g

The Average Price Target is at $30 while current price is $18 - investors are just waiting for a good quarter to see if the company can show profit. Now the last 3 quarterly earnings beat expextations significantly and it is highly likely that they will ON MONDAY post their first profitable quarter, being no in net loss. To add to the bonertown, they will post their full year 2019 data and 2020 forecast - publicly accessible for any retard to dial in - expect GOOD news.

Looking at the option pricing there is a huge implied volatility. For all the millenials in here this means there will be a major price movement expected and I'm rdy with my bull balls and calls. 

The earnings publish on Monday before open and I'm in with two plays at $22 short term calls and $26 long term calls.

""The bull thesis on bio-pharmaceutical company Amarin (NASDAQ:AMRN) for 2020 is pretty simple. The company’s core drug, Vascepa, is in the early innings of a huge multi-year growth trajectory. In 2020, several catalysts will meaningfully accelerate Vascepa’s growth trajectory. As they do, the company’s revenues and profits will continue to soar. Amarin stock isn’t fully priced for this growth.""

""With these competitors floundering, things look brighter for Vascepa. In other words, there’s good reason why Amarin stock could head higher.""

Now, not only will they lose their biggest growth market to coronavirus as nobody has the disposable income to be buying face-lightning cream and shit, they were already on a crash course to begin with. Although I think they did it to prop the share price up so they can make a swift exit. Finish Goods are up from 2018 to 2019 but Materials and Supplies are down. They already know there is a slowdown coming up so they simply stopped buying materials.

Things are looking so garbage that they've even started getting ready to prop up their ROE and ROA for the next few years by taking an $8.3 billion goodwill impairment charge in 2019. No such charges were filed in 2018 or 2017.

From Q1 – Q4, every year their YoY revenue growth numbers rise.

This is what FY2017 looked like:

Q1: -20.51% Q2: -16.1% Q3: -13.16% Q4: -6.3%

Total FY2017: -14.39%

FY2018 was a better year however, all the numbers were still in the red, and with little variation to be able to declare a trend.

2019 went -0.09% in Q1 to 6.31% in Q3, clearly gaining momentum into Q1 2020 where the YoY revenue growth was 7.85%. However, Q2 (Ending December), PG took a hit and went down to 4.6% BEFORE the beer virus hit.

In their 2019 annual report, they said the following:

>We continue to make progress in our largest markets. In the U.S., sales grew 4%, including 7% in the last quarter. This is after averaging about 1% over the past three fiscal years. In Greater China, we grew 10% with double-digit growth across our Fabric Care, Feminine Care, and Skin & Personal Care categories.

Their biggest revenue growth stream last year was by far in the Chinese market. They placed heavy emphasis on the demand (and plenty of competition) for female beauty products in China (Idk what, but I know the Chinese buy a lot of skin whitening creams and injections shit). Beauty products account for 22% of Net Earnings.

With China accounting for 9% of total sales, and being the biggest growth region in the last year, a slow-down in sales there will erode the outlook of the company significantly. On top of that, THE SALES THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN STAGNANT for over half a decade!!

Sales 2015: $70.7 billion

Sales 2016: $65.3 billion

Sales 2017: $65.1 billion

Sales 2018: $66.8 billion

Sales 2019: $67.7 billion

Net Earnings have been shrinking YoY since 2015.

Gross Profit was $35 billion in 2014. It’s $33 billion (before even adjusting for inflation) in 2019. 2020 will be a dumpster fire of a year for this stagnant company with the loss of growth in their highest growth region.

And here is the final piece of the puzzle that ensures that this company’s price needs to be corrected:

**Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B)** is about to drop their Q4 Earnings this weekend. Over the past year Berkshire has lagged the SP500 and no one has been really giving it much attention. **This earnings report is about to be one of the top 5 largest quarterly gains of all time**. **Their investment portfolio ALONE has gained around $35B since last quarter.** Think about how well AAPL has been doing, then remember that Berkshire's largest position is AAPL. Their AAPL position alone has gained nearly $20B dollars. No one is really looking at Berkshire while everyone is losing their shit over SPCE TSLA AMD, all while **Berkshire is sitting here with over $130B in cash** and a great portfolio

TLDR long call $SPCE leaps for free money. 

Let’s take a stroll down memory lane. Famed fake meat purveyor and beloved meme stonk of 2019, $BYND, experienced massive moves from May through July over two ERs then proceeded to cuck everyone after announcing a secondary. 

This no moat nothingburger ran up to $14 billion market cap on the $1T worldwide meat TAM and a hail marry partnership from $MCD. If this $TSN assassin can pump 14B market cap then truly anything is possible. Buffet like moat. No one got a moat bigger than $SPCE. (Yes, I’m all in SpaceX and Blue Origin whenever they list - but they probably gonna IPO via Wall Street and those bastards will suck up all the tendies.)

Even if you don’t believe in the $SPCE story recognize that $SPCE is the meme stonk of 2020. It doesn’t even matter if you buy the story. By the time Sir BDB is done pumping his first flight we all gonna be eating space ship Cheerios. The noise has not even begun. Branson is the undisputed master showman of his generation. He’s neck deep in aviation and knows exactly how to print money in that industry, not to mention virtually everyone he’s been in. 

Chamath, who is sitting on a cool $1B in $SPCE tendoids, is about to roll up to a 1 hr free HSN advertisement on CNBC’s Squawk day after earnings. If you think this king maker gonna volunteer to take fire for an hr on live tv while his stonk crashes 20% you’re already in space cause you ain’t living on this planet. He knows the news is gonna be stellar. That’s why he agreed to show up. He’s gonna pump his bottom line another cool billion. I expect an announcement on first flight timeline and opening up reservations including a price hike auction system for first movers.

Institutional investors. Take a look at the millions of shares folks like Vanguard are buying up. These people have teams of PhD number monkeys figuring out whether or not they should get into something and put those somethings in their portfolios. Your (and my) baby DD ain’t even in the same airspace. Just follow their money. 

Why 50? Market cap. For those of you who can’t math you take the shares outstanding and multiply by price per share. If you’re like me you think of companies in terms of market cap. If you stick your finger in your mouth and hold it up in the air that feeling you’re feeling is all the negative interest rate free central bank money sloshing around the world looking for a home. Hence 10B market cap for Virgin Galactic easier than your sister on prom night. Ergo 50 per share. 

Media blitz. Just getting warmed up:

We all know the gay bears are out in full force the past two days,  I bet they must feel so smart. But guess what? There are legitimate plays to make on beer virus that don’t involve betting the world will end (it won’t) or stupid vaccine speculation (you really think China is gonna pay for the vaccine?? They’re just gonna take that shit and make it themselves, duh). 

Here’s the big brain play: Quarantine baby boom. I know this probably hasn’t occurred to you virgins, but from what I’ve been told, people tend to fuck when completely bored and locked up with nothing to do. Think about every weekend when the markets close. What do you all do when bored out of your minds? Most of you degenerates masturbate furiously at least 6 or 7 times each day. But guess what? Porn is banned in China, which means that they pretty much have to get off the old fashion way, aka with real people. We’ve all heard of Hurricane babies and blackout babies, well in 9 months time, there will most certainly be millions of new quarantine babies. Think about it, hundreds of millions of Chinese people bored out of their minds, locked up with nothing to for weeks on end. Not to mention the inability to go to the store and buy condoms. There is also the [video](https://youtu.be/EBUa3WkStFg) of the apartment complex in Wuhan where you can hear what can only be described as thousands of Chinese people fucking. This is the perfect storm for  possibly the largest baby boom in modern history. 

Alright so what’s the play then?
I like P&G (PG), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), Nestlé, and Mattel (MAT). The Pampers diaper brand is P&G’s largest brand by sales, and KMB owns the Huggies and pull up diaper brands. Mattel owns fisher prices, Barbie, hot wheels, and other shit that my parents never bought for me. There’s also a bunch of other shit on the Shanghai exchange. This is by no means an exhaustive list of stocks for this play, so definitely come up with your most retarded ideas and let everyone know, so we can all lose money together. Personally looking into ways to get more exposure to the Chinese divorce industry, as we all know that children cause divorces (at least that’s what my parents told me when they got divorced).

\----

Cruise lines are the most discretionary of discretionary spending. Especially as most travelers are old, they will be super careful of cruises.

They way Carnival botched the Diamond Princess does not help their image at all. The fear is often a lot worse than reality, and that's what will be on the minds of most cruise-goers during the upcoming summer season.

Oh yeah, and looking forward to cancellations, analyst downgrades, the bad earnings and outlook and a whole host of other problems. It's like when a cruise gets ecoli, there's a ton of news and backlash. Well this time, it's like the entire fleet had it.

TLDR:  

1. There will be shitty guidance (April earnings)
2. Analyst downgrades will be incoming
3. Way more sensitive than airlines who rely on business travelers
4. CCL has almost no non-tourism land holdings
5. Target market is old people, which are most at risk.
6. (Even though they are not unionized) Worker refusal to work

CCL P$30 March 20 or P$25 July

DD,Starbucks Due Diligence - Key data points and quotes from management over the last several quarters.,22,f91lzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f91lzs/starbucks_due_diligence_key_data_points_and/,20,1582620650.0,"I [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/f91ifr/starbucks_due_diligenceresearch_i_went_through_a/) in the stock market sub about going through several Starbucks quarterly reports and earnings call transcripts and aggregating the data into charts. I also took note of important quotes from management as they commented on various questions throughout the earnings call. If you want to see the entire data and quotes, you can find the URL to the research report in the original thread. Otherwise here is a summary of the key points.

&#x200B;

# Key Points

&#x200B;

**1. From raw earnings data:**  
**A)** US growth is mainly derived from increased ticket prices (approximately 3-5%), a 3% Q.O.Q store growth and not so much an increase in store traffic (transactions).  
**B)** Global and US Traffic comps have been mainly flat over the the last 9 quarters with the exception of 2019 where adding variety to their menu has displayed an increase in store traffic and transactions. Executives believe they can continue to achieve at least 1% transactional comp growth while continuing ticket comp growth in the range of 3-4%.  
**C)** Loyalty members has been steadily increasing at a rate of mid-teens Q.O.Q. Starbucks attributes this to an increase in customer engagement and a better in-store customer experience.  


**2.** Starbucks, specifically in China, is working on digitizing the industry and making deliveries more accessible. They partnered with Alibaba to make this more feasible as they see steady growth in mobile delivery orders and loyalty program members. The key feature here was to be easily accessible with Alibaba and also make it possible to join the loyalty program with only a couple of clicks.

**3.** Expanding in China at approx 150 stores per quarter or 600 per year. Expects 6,000 stores in China by the end of FY 2022. They currently operate 4,292 stores in China or 13.5% of all Starbucks locations. The locations in China generate approximately 11.5% of Starbucks  sales.

**4.** Management commented about the increase in competition from Luckin Coffee saying it is only natural. There is a large and growing addressable market for coffee in China that has just begun to get penetrated and will attract more competition. Starbucks stated that because China is largely a tea drinking culture, more competitors in the coffee industry will accelerate the overall adoption of coffee by the Chinese consumer. Starbucks argues that what is good for the industry (more competitiveness) is also very good for Starbucks.

**5.** Coronavirus will have some impact on revenues. They estimate China accounts for 10% of revenues. They will provide more transparency coming in March and closer to earnings report in April. They estimate that opening new stores contribute to approximately 80% of Starbucks revenue growth.

**6.** Most existing stores are experiencing more revenue growth from increased prices rather than an increase of traffic or transactions. Most of Starbucks revenue growth will come from creating more opportunities and opening more stores. More stores = more growth for Starbucks and China is an opportunity in this sense as they are opening stores at a rate growth rate of 16% compared to opening stores at a rate of 3% in the U.S.

The Corona virus will have effects on the stocks of whatever people believe would be affected by manufacturing disruption, especially in the short term.

The average investor in this situation will turn to gold, bonds, ect. to ""ride out"" the downturn. This is one of the more stupid strategies for a projected short term disruption.

A temporary disruption is the best time to move over to speculative stocks which have a timeline outside that of the projected effects of the disruption. For a viral outbreak, that effect will be estimated by most people to be no more than a couple of months, getting past flu season.

You may have noticed SPCE went up today, and wondered why. I honestly think only part of that was optimism about the upcoming press conference and ER, and more people recognizing that a viral outbreak primarily concentrated in Asia will have zero effect on the estimated value of a North American based, vertically integrated aerospace company who wont be launching for several more months by most estimates.

Similarly, you could look at Pharmaceuticals who are looking for FDA approval several months in the future, small cap tech based in Europe or North America with projects still in development.

Stock: **Shake Shack (SHAK)**

Direction: **Mixed Bearish**

**Price Target:** **70$**

**Type: Call Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** Shake Shack is a restaurant company that is placed within the growth category due to its constant improvement in margins and same store sales. SHAK has drawn many comparisons with Chipotle, beating CMG in margins while maintain strong same store sales growth. Looking at its growth, we see negative YoY EPS and slightly negative revision sentiments.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, and below 200D.  MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 65, coming down from overbought. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bullish open interest. Implied movement of about 14.1% or 10.44$.

**Sentimental**: The biggest change for SHAK last quarter is their move to a single delivery service. There may be effects on same store sales, but moving forward, should see a rebound. In addition, conservative guidance may hurt the stock even more, due to coronavirus outbreak hurting their international expansion. There is also 15% short interest, making this play more dangerous than normal.

**ROI: 21%**

**Risk Level: 4 out of 5, Very Risky**

DD,Tandem Diabetes Care - 2/24/2020 AMC,7,f8w2vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f8w2vu/tandem_diabetes_care_2242020_amc/,9,1582599407.0," 

Stock: **Tandem Diabetes (TNDM)**

Direction: **Mixed Bearish**

**Price Target:** **85$**

**Type: Call Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** TNDM has been on a tear in 2020, with its stock rising more than 30% in 2 month. The main catalyst is their Control-IQ pumps, which have seen some setbacks due to its later release. However, its considered one of the best products in class and have shown potential. This potential is shown in TNDM’s charts and price growth. However, much of the upside has been priced in and given the current macro situation, this trade became much more muddled. Revenue growth is high, but slowing as well.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 70, coming down from massively overbought. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement of about 11.9% or 10$.

**Sentimental**: TNDM is diabetes and insulin pump king. With the current american diet failing and diabetes on the rise, it should prove that TNDM has a lot of momentum going forward. Given the short interest, if the stock trends flat or upwards, we should see some minor short covering, especially with the short (3.5) days to cover. This one is a doozy, as TNDM has history of beating top and bottom line while still losing stock price. The macro conditions may also heavily affect the outcome, so we sell 1 additional week to potentially ride the negative macro conditions.

**ROI: 21%**

**Risk Level: 4 out of 5, Very Risky**

If you’ve been keeping an eye of KGC, share prices have been constantly rising despite the bull run we have seen from commodity hedges and the corona virus is the catalyst that will explode KGC. DWS INVESTMENTS (UK) LTD bought 14.5 million shares of the stock,  TWO SIGMA INVESTMENTS LP bought approximately 5.3 million shares of Kinross Gold Corporation, VAN ECK ASSOCIATES CORP. bought 4.0 million shares of the company’s stock.

KGC has ratios that indicate it has been severly undervalued with a p/e of 11.46 compared to its industry average of 28.78. By this metric alone we can conclude in addition to the gold bull run we see now, KGC is the play to make.

The only problem was that I didn't have a sound strategy.

Fast forward to Sunday, January 12th. I was hungover as fuck and needed some food. I drove to my local McDonald's and asked for the best thing on the menu - the bacon, egg & cheese biscuit. The teller then relays to me that they were out of biscuits that morning. That told me 3 things:

1. Americans are still fat as shit and that's not changing any time soon. We have no problem consuming copious amounts of calories in the morning. Product demand = solid.
2. If my sample size of 1 is correct, that means that this is happening elsewhere. Lots of orders going to corporate demanding more biscuit inventory. Jobs = created.
3. I now needed to order something else - probably something more expensive to compensate for the loss and disappointment I was feeling. Just like that they sucked more money out of me. Profit = maximized.

I left the parking lot with the hunch that McDonald's is a subtle juggernaut from a business fundamentals perspective. Ever since that day I have yolo'd a size-able portion of my biweekly paycheck into $MCD after checking biscuit availability at various locations. So far it's can't-lose as MCD is up around 6% on the year. Corona virus has had no(!!!) impact this far.

You've come to the right place. I have the DD that is going to save each of your portfolios. Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) is a company that provides liquidity to marijuana growers. In short, a cannabis company will sell IIPR their facility for say, $20,000,000, then IIPR will lease it back to them on a monthly basis. The average length of the leases is 13 fucking years, IIPR has these cannabis companies paying them monthly, every month, for an average of 13 years. Pretty simple shit. IIPR gives these companies funds for the business, and in return they get the land and facility.  IIPR takes the role of a bank here considering that banks cannot loan marijuana growers money.

&#x200B;

Now, here's the interesting bit, IIPR has an earnings call on Wednesday, and they should be able to beat it. For EACH one of the past 6 quarters IIPR has announced a dividend increase, and either beaten or tied earnings. They've fundraised over $400m in the past two months or so, and it's expected that they will announce more contracts with more cannabis companies using that money. With the earnings call having good guidance, beating earnings, and a dividend increase on the horizon, this stock is gonna fucking soar. Granted, the dividend increase and contract announcements could come a bit later than the earnings call itself.

&#x200B;

It was $80 a share a month ago, currently about $102, and although it's been hit a little by this shitty market day, it hasn't really gone down much, but what it has done is provided an excellent opportunity for a cheap buy. This should not be hit by the beer virus, as it's a real estate investment company in the States, there's no tangible effect CV could even have. It won't disrupt any supply chains, it won't stop business, nothing gets fucked by the CV, unless of course this shit truly gets out of hand in America, but at that point, you'd have bigger concerns anyways.

&#x200B;

IIPR is the only company of it's kind that was able to get a ticker, due to it's affiliation with marijuana companies. No other company of it's sort was even able to get a ticker, and nobody really knows how IIPR got through this process, meaning that for the time being, IIPR is one of a kind, so if you want to invest in marijuana real estate, this is your only fucking chance. Not to mention, real estate is one of the safest things you can invest in aside from gold right now.

&#x200B;

I have $115 March 20th calls for IIPR which are worth about $2.80 each, and I think the stock price will be about $122 at that time. So, we can look at other options that are currently $7 in the money for IIPR and find $95c 3/20 calls that are worth $11.40 each. Meaning, if my predictions are right, and this hits $122 by March 20th, calls currently worth around $2.75-2.85 will be worth at LEAST $10 each by March 20th, nearly a 400% gain. This stock will be how I am rebounding from the past few days, and anyone that wants to join me is welcome.

Whichever plays you decide to make today, good luck autists.

TLDR: IIPR 3/20 $115c

EDIT: I have a screenshot on my phone from last week showing my IIPR shares when they were in the mid 90s, should provide some validity.

The retards who run $TQQQ are autists just like you, they over-leveraged themselves and are now going bust. Instead of holding cash closer to 15-20-25% of their nominal exposure, as they normally do, in the past years they started holding less and less, now around 9-10% of nominal exposure in cash, and another 23-33% in STONKS (because holding stonks instead of cash = more gainz, greedy asswipes). You can find their holdings on Friday after close [here](https://www.proshares.com/funds/tqqq_daily_holdings.html) if you want to confirm. 

That works until it doesn't, and today they are blowing themselves the fuck up. After Friday's close rebalancing, TQQQ held $12,520,585,402 worth of nominal exposure in NASDAQ 100 Index SWAPS (i.e. if NDX is up 1% on Monday, they get paid 1% of the $12.5b in cash at the end of the day, and if it's down 1% on Monday, they lose 1% of the $12.5b and have to pay up at the end of they day).

Their collateral is as follows: $1,327,634,666 CASH (around 10.6% of exposure) and $4,266,859,496 in STONKS at Friday closing prices (34% of exposure).


IF NDX closes down 5% today, they have to pony up around $625m cash. This will cut the total assets from $5.6b to $5b. But 77% of their collateral assets are in stocks, which are also down. So their actual asset value will be AT MOST ~$4.3b. That's actually a LOSS of ~25% for today, not 15%. But wait, there's more. TQQQ will need at least an extra $1b in CASH on top of their loss for today, to use as swap collateral in the rebalancing for tomorrow. That means TQQQ will have to DUMP STONKS OUT THE MF WAZOO, which will bring QQQ down even further, which will mean that TQQQ will close down even more than 15% etc => feedback loop => even worse loss => real trouble

IF NDX closes down more than 6-7%, it's a straight up BUST. 

Not only are they greedy fucks, they actually increased their share holdings to cash ratio since the 19th... That's right, TQQQ bought the dip and now are gettting EXTRA bearclapping. 


Plays are SELL ANY TQQQ shares you're long bros don't be retarded and risk holding the bag all the way to 0, short TQQQ and/or back up the truck and buy asstons of OTM puts.

TLDR: TQQQ got greedy, over-leveraged themselves, and now getting their ass MARGIN CALLED by the gay bear gang and have a good chance of going BUST.

Last year my hot Russian girlfriend (sidenote: I’ve infiltrated the Russians) who is now my wife (I bought her a huge blood diamond with the tendies she made me) predicted the rise of TJ Maxx. She feels similarly confident going into earnings this week. Reasons why I agree:

1) She sent me this pic, unprompted, a couple weeks ago: https://imgur.com/gallery/azaaGJJ

2) Her friends, all firmly middle-class nurses, were over our house Saturday and my wife remarked on a sweater one friend was wearing, and said friend said she got it at TJ Maxx. Becky is a maxxanista. 

3) TJ Maxx doesn’t care about beer virus. Their stock is from 2 seasons ago.

4) No one wears expensive clothes anymore. If you’re wearing a suit with a pocket square, French cuffed dress shirt, Italian loafers, and a tie bar, you look like a douche. 

TL;DR Long TJX, don’t short them, for their great deals on short skirts and long jackets.

DD,DD Potential beer virus impact by country,38,f9n47n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9n47n/dd_potential_beer_virus_impact_by_country/,34,1582717612.0,"I see a lot of speculation here about coronavirus and whether it will or won't have a significant impact on the world economy.  Now, there has definitely been a market downturn since the beginning in January, but I wanted to perform a rudimentary analysis to determine which countries were likely to be the most damaged economically by the coronavirus outbreak through lost tourism and supply chain disruption from China.

The simplest factor to estimate is the risk to economies due to lost tourism revenues.  For this, I simply took travel and tourism as a percentage of nominal GDP in the countries I analyzed and normalized it.  From this analysis, the countries at highest risk due to lost tourism revenues are: the Philippines (2.23), Thailand (2.02), Mexico (1.60), Spain (1.47), and Italy (1.35).

Next, I wanted to estimate the impact of lost economic productivity through delays in shipments from China.  For that, I looked up each country's imports from China and calculated and divided it by that country's nominal GDP.  Next, I multiplied this number by the percentage of that country's GDP attributable to industry.  Then, I normalized those values across the countries surveyed.  The countries with the highest industrial risk were Malaysia (3.47), UAE (2.70), Philippines (2.21), Thailand (2.21), and South Korea (1.93).  Outside of Asia, the country with higher than average industry risk was the Netherlands (1.05).

However, all this information and rankings aren't useful if the impact is already priced in.  Therefore, I looked up the last month's high and current stock index value for studies countries to calculate how far they've already dropped.  Then, as you probably expected if you actually read this far, I normalized these values too. 

Now that I have sets of normalized values, all I have to do is compare them to evaluate whether or not coronavirus impact has been proportionately priced in.  If the normalized risk factor is greater than the normalized market drop, then that means there is potential that coronavirus impact is not priced in.  Here is a list of countries and tickers that you can buy puts on for them:

Malaysia: Industry risk - 3.47 vs market drop of 0.55 (3.5%).  Malaysia is in an interesting situation because their stock market was already at a 5 year low at the start of this.  However, things can always get worse.   Ticker: EWM (iShare MSCI Malaysia)

Thailand - Industry Risk - 2.16, tourism risk - 2.02 vs market drop of 1.21 (7.6%).  Ticker: THD (iShares MCSI Thailand)

South Korea - Industry Risk 1.93 vs market drop of 1.16 (7.3%).  Ticker: EWY (iShares MSCI South Korea)

United Arab Emirates: Industry risk - 2.70 vs market drop of 0.92 (5.8%).  Unfortunately, while there is a ticker, UAE, for UAE stock exposure, there are no options available for it

The Philippines - Industry Risk 2.21, tourism risk 2.23 vs market drop of 0.68 (4.2%). Unfortunately, while there is a ticker, EPHE, for Philippines, there are no options available for it

Let’s talk.

This post couldnt get posted cause my title's were all too gay. Sorry.

Im a gay bear. But I like to consider myself a smart gay bear. I haven’t shorted the market. I sit in cash and long vix to cash in on the volatility spikes. Now that that is out of the way I want to raise some points.

[https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix) Check out this link. Watch what the dark index is doing and gamma. Dark index is not buying this drop with any significance. Gamma is also falling through the floor to some of the lowest levels recorded with some serious record speed,that is opening the door to volatility which tends to mean more down. I myself have been predicting this rally in vix for awhile and I don’t think it’s done... I would wait to buy around 2990-3025 for scalping but I am just guesstimating with what I got. I like to wait for the market to show it has strength and give buy signals rather then bottom pick. I also want to mention that vix is exploding so as it pushes higher with more people rushing to cover (big banks are the ones leveraged short on vix) get ready for the flood gates to open.

Https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZiAE4Vau/ Next let’s talk technicals but large picture. One of my absolute favorite indicators is the Chaikin oscillator. Do you see how it’s been treating that as support this entire bull market? I would be very weary of that breaking. RSI broke on monthly once we close out in a couple days. MACD looking crappy. And if we tear through that pennant we built things should get very ugly this year.

Fundamentals: Coronavirus looks like crap. Yes it has a 2% death rate and bla bla bla. Who cares. It’s shit because production shuts down. The numbers are understated everywhere, they can’t test everyone and this shit is definitely already a pandemic. Good news is we probably all won’t die. Bad news is it’s going to kill consumerism. If we spend less/buy less we aint gonna go nowhere which is going to seriously fuck our already teetering global economy.

Repo market has not been resolved. Fed is looking to clean house by April so this looks to only get worse.

Inverted yield curve is not to be fucked with. It happened and time is ticking. We are living on borrowed time and this is an amazing forward looking indicator that doesn’t get the respect it deserves. (Bless up to the homie Harvey Campbell).

Bernie is looking more and more like the candidate to be nominated. As his chances increase to win expect further drops everywhere. u/haupt91 mentioned how universal healthcare on its own would essentially eliminate about 16% of the S\&amp;P500 (remember this point for later).

These past two recessions average between about 40-60% haircuts. This is no joke. No you won’t get a garden variety recession like the days of old. It’s due to inflated balance sheets and how we encourage/structure our debt in this country. Great growth comes with great loss. That is a whole different topic I don’t want to get too deep into with this post.",2020-02-26 04:33:15

If I had a large amount of capital i'd be buying GLD shares with all of it. I don't have a large amount of capital because I am (for the time) a broke ass bitch.

I bought GLD 04/17 152C last week and had 5 days of profit in a row (about 300%). Today was a loss from the start but really hurt with the selloff in the last 20 minutes of the market. I bought another GLD 05/15 168C about halfway through the day today in an attempt to BTFD.

I am staying highly optimistic for the following reason:

Corona virus causing\* a panic and correction in the stock market, which GLD tends to have a negative correlation with in regards to its value (longer than the course of a day apparently).

Gold in general acting as a safe haven in times where there is reason for cheap money to panic in the market. 

The fact that the fed has been printing money like thats the only thing they are supposed to do with QE ,which is without a doubt going to weaken the dollar, but who really knows how long that will take to result in significant inflation.

Link to activity in GLD calls for 04/17, 05/15, 06/19 that had a vol of over 200 and V/OI over .5

TLDR: GLD is a safe haven, \*coronavirus and panic selloff will be a coverup reason to buy gold when the real profits are going to be a lack of responsibility the Fed has taken through extensive QE.

Direction: **Mixed Bullish**

**Price Target:** **40$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** lol

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50 day moving averages, no 200D average yet.  MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 72, coming down from massively overbought. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bullish open interest. **Implied movement of about 23% or 8.05$. Short interest rate is 19%, about 1.15 days to cover, and about 37% of total available float is shorted.** SPCE is currently considered “hard to borrow”, putting pressure and fees on short sellers. **19% institutional ownership = much more sentiment and retail driven.**

**Sentimental**: There are several key factors at play for SPCE’s earnings this quarter. The first factor is the updated timetable regarding commercial flights. Previously, SPCE stated that first commercial flights will begin Q1/Q2 2020. **If the flight timetable is reinforced or even confirmed, it can be a very strong catalyst to keep the stock up.** Second factor at play is the revenue accrued from reservation deposits. **In September 2019, SPCE annouced they have 600 tickets sold, amounting to about 80M in revenue. As of 2/24/2020, SPCE’s website noted that all tickets have been sold out.** While a 750k revenue on 7.3B market cap seems dumb, the accrued revenue from reservations would be the biggest factor in the operational performance area. The last factor at play is the **potential for SPCE to announce an equity raise given the stock’s current high price.** **Depending on the price and shares released, it can materially affect the stock’s price downwards**. A 4th issue was concluded merely yesterday, as **SPCE finally registered its warrants.** This prevents a cashless exercise scenario, which would hurt the stock price due to a brief, but massive influx of shares. While total dilution would be smaller by 12 million or about 60%, a cashless exercise will wreck the short-term float. 31 million shares over the course of 5 years is much more manageable. One last factor is the current macro psychology\*\*. Because we are near the tail end of the longest bull run in American history, traders are looking for even more aggressive trades to pull even higher returns.\*\*

The question for this earnings is entirely a retail fueled sentiment show. If SPCE can keep up the retail hype through news and announcements, it can lead retail to stay stubborn with price action. In addition, since most of the price is driven by retail purchases, price action will reflect much more of the sentiments, rather than anything logical. Chance of a sustained short squeeze is almost nothing due to 1.15 SI Ratio.

DD,Amarin (AMRN) 2/25/2020 AMC - Profit collect later PLEASE,80,f9dzcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9dzcr/amarin_amrn_2252020_amc_profit_collect_later/,74,1582681425.0,"Stock: **AMARIN (AMRN)**

Direction: **Bullish**

**Price Target:** **20$, 22$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** Amarin is currently off a slow decline due several weaknesses, most prominent being its patent lawsuit against 2 other companies. This can hurt their profitability and market share, as AMRN currently dominates the heart disease medicine area with Vascepa. In addition, AMRN is looking to report a 80%+ YoY revenue growth on the back of Vascepa, while maintaining a decent EPS. There also has been rumors of M&A, though I doubt it’ll factor into this earning.

**Technical**: Priced below in 20, 50, 200D average, while being bullish in nature.  MACD shows neutral convergence. RSI shows around 40, going towards oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and very bullish open interest. Implied move is 10.8% or about $2. Short interest is surprisingly high at 11.5%, or about 30% float. The SI ratio is about 7. 

**Sentimental**: After its approval and label expansion for their blockbuster drug Vascepa, Amarin has faced several issues that prevented it from realizing gains. These issues include patent challenges, lawsuits, and general investor uncertainty. Last quarter, AMRN knocked it out of the park, and faced a subsequent sell off that is stabilizing just now. With huge YoY improvement in earnings performance, I believe Amarin will come up on top, even in spite of coronavirus fears. The main bear case is that of profit collecting, which may trigger if the outstanding issues I’ve listed are not properly addressed. 

**ROI% - 54%, 102%**

**Risk Level - 3 out of 5, 5 out of 5.**

2 plays 2 different level of risk/reward. Both are bullish.

Amarin is fickle. It can beat really hard and still sell off. This time might be different, but I'd suggest closing for profit earlier than later if we win.",2020-02-25 20:43:45

Walmart is now offering Fullfillment centers just like Amazon

Soon Walmart will be offering One day shipping, marketing for one day shipping and will bringing in A LOT of sellers over from Amazon

This is basically PRIME but for Walmart and at no charge

their revenue will go up, not sure about profit

Walmart will definitely start marketing more and their growth is going to be big within the next year (calls all year)

Walmart has many MANY more resources than Amazon and physical locations to hold all the new inventory from new and current sellers

Walmarts revenue is going to go up a lot, not sure about profit

Start buying Calls at least a month or two out, to get real tendies wait until after summer (Q2,Q3) to really see the difference of their fulfillment success

**Update:** for background im a seller on Amazon, currently our account is around $3million sales/year, if we add Walmart as one of our selling channels we can easily do another $1 Million in a year and are currently moving forward with sending our inventory to Walmart as a test run, stop being retarded and saying Target is better.

Conclusion: Positive Results but Fear of Coronavirus shadowed earnings and stock fell. Forward looking forecast by company projects virus fears will shave off $0.75 from 2020 EPS.

**My View**

I believe Cruise Ship Stocks have further to fall before they can mount anything remotely close to a recovery. As virus related fears continue escalating the rate of cruise and customer cancellations will continue to mount. Every new country that experiences an outbreak of the virus will lead to weary customers and softer booking rates. On Feb 12th, Royal Caribbean Cruises said “ There are still too many variables and uncertainties to make a reasonable forecast for 2020” after already having stated the due to virus related events they are lowering 2020 EPS by $.65, but adding on that if all Asian cruises had to be cancelled they would shave off another $.55 minimum, and that’s based on if they cancel Cruises through April.  Norwegian stated it expects full year EPS down $.75 per share, and said that the impact could be larger by discouraging people from booking cruises.

RCL (china represents like 7% of their bookings) operates cruises out of these 9 ports in the Asia/Pacific Region:

Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Yokohama, Singapore, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth.

For those weak on geography the first 3 cities are Chinese, the following 2 are Japanese, and the last 3 are Australian. So far, we can assume that virus fears are widespread in China, despite pooh bear clamping down virus related information spreading (in addition to falsifying infection #’s). Japan was the unlucky host to the Cruise that which had the virus spread like wildfire. In addition, there are now 700 confirmed cases of the virus linked to that ship. So, I think we can assume that the virus information is widespread in japan too, and not too many people are lining up to hop on to those Cruises. Singapore while not suffering from any large outbreaks yet, still is very vulnerable. Their airport is one of the busiest in the world and their country a popular destination for many leaving them susceptible to an outbreak sometime soon. They do have 91 cases reported as well as some others that can be traced back to Singapore. Haven’t really seen much about Australia, other than they are preparing for the virus (just like every other country so its not really pointing to much). However, in the context of cruises their populace is likely well aware of the Westerdam Cruise that was refused port in 5 places before finally docking in Cambodia. Looking at all this, I think its fair to say that we will keep seeing Cruise cancellations in the region and possibly even full region cancellations at least in the non-Australian cities. 

Add to all this the simple fact that cruises are a luxury good and no one’s going to give two shits about ditching a cruise for a full refund when their health is at stake. On top of all that if you look at the departures from Chinese airports, they have fallen a ton(Check Pictures at bottom) and I assume the impact on cruise bookings is way more significant then airline bookings/cancellations. The attachment that this virus has to the cruises is not something that's going to be easy to shake, and there's still a lot of uncertainty surrounding this virus so I think we will see further cancellations outside of the Asian region. The stock will react negatively towards those cancellations because as long as the sentiment around the industry is negative any negative sign is gonna keep pushing it down no matter how far its already fallen. The virus has a lot more places to infect and a lot more cruises to disrupt, and these stocks have a while to go before they see any semblance of a recovery. 

My play is to buy puts dated at least 1-2 months out and likely going to sell some calls. RCL looks especially weak for their earnings call, I assume it’ll be similar to Norwegian (good report, shitty projections) small pop followed by it heading straight down.

The S&P 500 is down 8% over the last 5 sessions. There have only been 44 other times this has happened over a 5 day window since 1969. Of these, 66% were higher over the next week with an average increase of around 2.2%.

[https://imgur.com/tJ3yEqv](https://imgur.com/tJ3yEqv)

And we’ve fallen 5 sessions straight. If you go back and look at every time we’ve fallen for 5 sessions straight with a cumulative decline of 8% or more, the market has risen 100% of the time with an average increase of 5%. But we only have 6 times this has happened since 1969.

Direction: **Neutral Bullish**

**Price Target:** **80$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread** 

**Fundamental:** Square has been growing very quickly and maintains its growth velocity through new product innovation and more market share capturing. SQ also lowballed EPS and Revenue guidance last quarter, making this quarter much easier to beat. However, with the global slowdown due to coronavirus, forward guidance will become very important. Square cannot sandbag guidance this quarter as any weakness shown will be exposed. 

**Technical**: Priced above 50 and 200 day moving averages, below 20D average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 45, neutral. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 8.6% or about 6.64$

**Sentimental**: Square is looking to massively beat EPS and Revenue, and is set up to guide even higher in 2020. The key concern here is the public perception and intense macro fear. **This large negative macro will affect positive earnings negatively, as it prevents a lot of buyers from jumping due to macro fear.** All things aside, square should come out of the earnings on top, but we don’t know how the market will react to a win. 

**ROI : 20%**

**Risk Level - 3 of 5, Risky**

**Close fast if profitable. Square has a very consistent tendency to go lower regardless of earnings the week after.  Sell call credit spreads a week further out if you know how.**

Direction: **Neutral** 

**Price Target:** **50$**

**Type: Call Credit Spread, Iron Condor**

**Fundamental:** Etsy is a transforming growth company that is slowly generating more and more profitability while growing revenue at a steady pace. Etsy is a niche market with a strong brand. This makes them a very attractive target for acquisition. Etsy has also been consistently profitable, though there were some margin and revenue contractions in the past. Q4 typically has always been good to Etsy. 

**Technical**: Priced above 50D MA, below 20 and 200D MA.  MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming up from neutral. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and bullish open interest, with 45P and 60C being the 2 most traded strikes. Implied movement of 14.7% or 7.50$.

**Sentimental**: Given the online niche marketplace that Etsy resides in, seasonal gains are normal. EPS improvements are none, but revenue is slated to grow 30%+ YoY, which is a benchmark for growth companies in general. Guidance was sandbagged and this quarter may see a repeat performance in both top and bottom line beats.  **The new 12% fee will also give management a means to spike guidance, which is the primary bull case for this earnings. While there have been backlash and talks of leaving the platform, the niche market Etsy operates  in will be a great moat to force compliance.** 

**ROI : 23%**

**Risk Level - 4 of 5, Very Risky**

**Iron Condor should be 45$ and 60$ with a 2$ width. \*\* This is more advanced and will require management.**

Direction: **Neutral Bearish**

**Price Target:** **80$**

**Type: Call Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** Since raising guidance in November, Best Buy has rode the economic tailwind to grow from 75\~ to over 90$ at one point. This is in addition to the cancelled electronics tariffs, along with an improving trade war tension. PE and revenue are going YoY, along with a slew of analyst upward revisions provide a slight bullish backdrop. 

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50 day moving averages, above 200D average.  MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 45, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are bearish in volume and bearish open interest, OI driven by the 2/28 74 PUT with 1500 volume and 3.8k OI. Implied movement is 8% or about 6.70$

**Sentimental**: Best Buy has been on a tear since its revised guidance due to holiday sales cheer. However, given the disruption in supply chain, guidance should be affected, which also will affect the earnings outcome. In addition, the coronavirus fears will spur defensive strategies, making a huge bull run unlikely. The primary bull case is if Best Buy smashes earnings and expectations, while keeping guidance inline. To mitigate this, we buy 2 additional weeks out.

**ROI : 26%**

**Risk Level - 3 of 5, Risky**

The [booze fest has spread to Italy](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/25/europe/italy-coronavirus-backfoot-intl/index.html) and it may bring down the shittiest Jenga tower in the world that is the Italian Banking system. Italian government [debt to GDP is well over 100%](https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/government-debt-to-gdp), [Private debt to GDP is around 160%](https://tradingeconomics.com/italy/private-debt-to-gdp), and growth for this year is expected at [a whopping 0.5%](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/01/29/Italy-Staff-Concluding-Statement-of-the-2019-Article-IV-Mission).

Now, you may say that Italy isn't actually in all that bad of shape because Italy has actually done a great job of [reducing its non-performing loans](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/italy/non-performing-loans-ratio) over the last few years (they're down to just over 8% now from literally every single loan! Lovely!), except for the fact that a loan is only non-performing in Italy when no one's thrown a meatball at it for over a year - if you set 90 days with no payment as non-performing, [17% of gross loan volume](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DDSI02ITA156NWDB) isn't doing so hot .

One good cough and that  house is blowing down, and this house is an overpriced Tuscan villa that's big enough to take the Eurozone with it.

China has billions of dollars to chuck at financial markets and can support that cash chucking with future economic growth; Italy's *optimistic* forecast is 0% growth after next year. If you think the Greek Bailouts were a shit-show for Europe, let's play the same game but with an economy 6 times the size and financial centers that represent more than bunny slopes by international banking standards. Oh, and, sprinkles on the mud pie - Germany is also experiencing an [economic slowdown](https://www.wsj.com/articles/german-growth-falls-to-six-year-low-hit-by-manufacturing-recession-11579086072), the UK is out of the EU, and euro-skeptics have gained seats in a number of European parliaments, so I'm betting the bailouts won't be nearly as generous this time around. $1 puts on EWI.

If corona hits at a given rate, an increase in travel should lead to an increase in reported cases. That's what you see in a responsible place like Canada, or maybe Singapore. See that fat point on the right of the Figure 1? That's where the rate is being massively underreported.

Now the authors of this study hid the labels for the points as to not ""implicate"" any particular country, but I'll let you in on a tasty little secret. Thailand had the greatest air travel volume from Wuhan in 2018 - at least 500 passengers per day.  

Thailand has still only reported 40 cases of corona. Singapore has 1/4th the travel and 93 reported cases. Adding up? I give it two weeks to implode.

DD,Why $GILD is Ready to Break Out 💹📈↗,131,fang8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fang8n/why_gild_is_ready_to_break_out/,139,1582885232.0,"**$GILD** is set to 🚀🚀🚀. Ride the Coronavirus fear

Yesterday,  [u/condensedOJ](https://www.reddit.com/user/condensedOJ/) made a post arguing to buy $GILD for 2/27 Market Open. I made the argument that $GILD was overbought and was likely to crash soon, and our time to buy would be within the next 2 weeks as the market calmed down from Coronavirus fears.

I think that time is Friday 2/28 **AT THE DIP** Edit: bolded it for you illiterate fucks LMAO stop messaging about buying at open

IMPORTANT DEETS:

1. $GILD leading coronavirus treatment progress overall. (Remdesivir) [https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/investing/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-who-remdesivir/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/24/investing/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-who-remdesivir/index.html)**""There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that's remdesivir,""** Bruce Aylward, an assistant director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said at a press conference in Beijing.
2. $GILD has been testing the vaccine/treatment in China and are on PHASE 3 already. They've been hyped over Phase 1 trial news in the US so far. Every Phase they pass will be a huge $$$ boost[https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/2/gilead-sciences-initiates-two-phase-3-studies-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19](https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2020/2/gilead-sciences-initiates-two-phase-3-studies-of-investigational-antiviral-remdesivir-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19)
3. \*\*\*\*Most other overhyped companies are just starting PHASE 1, and they havent even passed it yet.

Now check the graph below. Top to bottom we have 3 indicators for the last 5 days. For those in need of a refresher, we're looking at Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index, and the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator.

https://preview.redd.it/63o7zzjsjkj41.png?width=1915&format=png&auto=webp&s=811e6ec95bca9e3faa1693a3c73d8c53edf9e16e

Together, this confirms some previous beliefs, and establishes the basis for several more conclusions.

1. Prior to market open on 2/27, we see from the RSI that the security is likely to be overbought with an RSI \~70, indicating that we should prepare for a return to \~RSI 50 (our equilibrium).
2. At 2/27 Market Open, Investors scramble to buy $GILD and the price skyrockets, bringing us to the next indicator we will analyze, being the Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands show the 2 standard deviations above 2 below the SMA. We see that the Bollinger Band breakthrough causes Wall St Algorithmic Trading bots to instantly sell, driving price down and further triggering private trading bots to instantly sell and secure % gains. Thus, the hype finally crashes due to OVERhype and botting reaction to it. (70% of trading in US is algorithmic, you are not just playing with people, but also machines)
3. WSB users still autistic and bought high and going to sell low on 2/27.

🍆🍆🍆

HOWEVER, this provides us with the opportunity now to buy in on 2/28 to prepare for the weekend as the evidence below will show.

1. Look at the Accumulation/Distribution Indicator. We see over the last 5 days, there has been a gradual increase of people BUYING $GILD. The indicator is as it sounds. It's cumulative, meaning that a rise means more people are buying, and a fall means more people are selling.
2. This overall uptrend of the Accum/Dist Indicator gives us the confidence to BUY IN. But we need to get the timing right to avoid the Autistic ™  fall of those following [u/condensedOJ](https://www.reddit.com/user/condensedOJ/) yesterday (probably seeing a 30% fall in ~~put~~  Call premiums after they purchased at market open AKA losing 1/3 their money in 10 minutes).
3. Now follow the RSI line and note how it falls to \~40. This in combination with the Bollinger Bands beginning to tighten and the $GILD price evening out indicates to us that a short squeeze may be imminent (with prices shooting up likely Monday or Tuesday).

PREDICTIONS:

1. FRIDAY 2/28 $GILD goes up from Market Open and if you buy Calls, you'll be winning right out the gates.
2. If $GILD goes down after Market Open but you bought Calls already, you'll temporarily be losing money. HOWEVER, after the weekend, with the buildup of coronavirus news, California potential OUTBREAK, and DJIA going down, $GILD will be set to skyrocket anyways and you'll be rolling in the tendies 🤑🤑
3. Goes down at open. BTFD

TLDR;

Buy $GILD $80-$90 Calls for 3/20 - 4/17. If you're rich, or just 🌈🌈 then buy them out further at higher premium.

Even if a cure is found the whole thing is in the shitter.

Most factories across the world work in what they call ""just-in-time"" capacity, meaning they have low inventory (inventory is expensive) and receive new materials very often. This allow them to be very cost efficient _when every goes right_.

Now that China has been closed for a few weeks, suppliers will soon not be able to give factories what is needed to keep them working. Now factories aren't stupid, they keep enough of a buffer to not stop production at the first blip. But this is not a small blip. China will take time to scale back up to 100%, and many western factories will start to be out of material to work in the few weeks, after that suppliers will have to wait on China for new shipments, and factories will be on a stop. This will take at best 6 months to a year to come back to what production was a few weeks ago. And this could cause a fucking meltdown.
This is why China is working its ass off to put people back to work, they know they're major fucked if that happens. Because the first things western factories will do once everything is back is try to be less reliant on Chinese materials, so that next time this happen shit won't hit the fan as hard.

In my opinion, even if we have a working vaccine tomorrow, and unless beervirus gets less huggy chonky, we're still tanking.

Its not like a fucking boomer stock or anything, and this shit is also gonna rely on the upcoming 5G data transfer and network infrastructure evolution already underway.

\*You need to understand that 5G wireless technology is REVOLUTIONARY.  I'm too lazy to pull up the EXACT numbers, but this tech is going to reshape society in the way the Industrial Revolution revitalized America's domestic confidence almost 100 years ago.  

Anyway, we are actually heading into the 'second phase' of 5G's rollout and what that means for stonks now is that companies involved in TESTING 5G equipment (small cells, RF / antennas, and semi-conductors...), as well as the SUPPLIERS of 5G COMPONENTS to the big companies that will use this obviously which include Apple or Samsung or At&T...  so this means Apple isn't benefitting the most from this at the moment...  and ultimately by 'Phase 3' of 5G rollout, the stocks that will benefit the most are the service products that utilize 5G to revolutionize various industries (including health).

so basically $TDOC leaps are a potential 10 bagger play for phase 3 (thats my bet at-least) because they will allow you to order prescriptions / see your doctor over a smart phone rather than physical visit.  This and similar services will save a lot of time for a lot of people.  (These services using 5G capabilities will become MORE useful for automating smaller tasks for businesses to save money like just a basic prescription renewal visit) and by the way companies like CVS will eventually offer medication Delivery...

Now that we are staring in the face of a recession, there are no more kitchen sinks to throw, no more back up plans, nothing to save us from the impending demise that is going to be the cash flow / credit crunch that is going to unleash the hail mary of debt bubbles that will destroy anuses left and right.

With Coronavirus as the trigger, cash flows world wide across government, businesses, and consumers will come to a sudden halt, a domino effect amplified by the rise of globalisation.

What happens when that $14 trillion of corporate debt and its interest (not even mentioning the shadow banking debt, which may even be larger) becomes due and payable in the US, requiring monthly payment in an environment where cash inflows are at the lowest?

1. **Print more money?** We've seen how great that has worked in the past few years at spurring economic growth. There's a reason why Lehman Brothers wasn't bailed out in 2008, fellas. Even the money printer has a limit when we're talking about 10 digit figures that will do nothing to improve economic growth and only keep insolvent companies running for longer, further throwing money into a limitless pit that only expounds on the problem.

2. **Lower interest rates?** Interest rates globally are at near zero. Some economies have already employed negative rates and we can see how well they've done. This is not even a viable solution and the effect will be akin to trying to stop a flood with a piece of tissue

Here's what's going to happen in the coming months:

**Debt deflation** -- Undoubtedly, what the central banks will do is resort to what they've been doing for the past decade (which is what got us here in the first place), that is, option 1; print more money. However, here is the crux of the issue, **none of that money is going to go into investments or spurring economic growth.** It will all go into debt repayments to keep themselves in a desperate struggle to stay afloat as assets are liquidated, expenses are cut, employees are made redundant, etc. Any remaining money will be used for stock buybacks to futilely keep their crashing stock price from doing the inevitable.

Now, we have a situation where no cash is moving around the economy (at least not into any productive assets), everyone and their mothers are liquidating assets to repay debts and pay their bills, and the central banks are leaving the money printer on in overdrive, printing money that goes nowhere.

Lowes just announced 1.7 billion in investments towards their supply chain.

Take a look at their 5 year chart and you'll see, like many other meme stocks, its growing consistently.

If you analyze peaks (you can go look at this yourself im not going to draw it out for you) you'll notice that Lowe's has a trend. At the beginning of their dip the clock starts ticking for roughly 6 months of downtime before MASSIVE peaks.

The housing market is likely on the up. Interest rates are lower than they've been on mortgages and more people are being drawn to buy. More houses = more supply chain = more $ for retards making calls 6 months out on a projected growth.

Some Key points:

\-  Though [novel 2019 coronavirus](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-wuhan-coronavirus-is-spreading-from-china-to-the-us-heres-what-you-need-to-know)  cases in the United States have so far ticked up in fits and starts,  experts on deadly diseases say Americans should be prepared to see an  overnight boom in cases that mirror the skyrocketing outbreaks in Italy  and South Korea. 

\-  For most people, symptoms are mild to moderate. Less than 20 percent of confirmed cases have been severe, and just two percent fatal 

\-  “When the risk of sustained transmission of a highly infective disease  in a community is very high, quarantine becomes less effective because  it is impossible to trace all patient contacts,” 

\- In the aftermath of the recession in 2008, “There’s been a decimation  of public health infrastructure and capacity at the local and state  level.” 

\-  Americans should expect sustained community transmission “in the near future.” 

\-  Authorities would do best to implement social distancing—school  shutdowns, telecommuting to work, cancellation of public gatherings, and  closure of public transportation—over a quarantine or travel lockdown.  \*Note - This would help reduce Economic impact

Edit 3: I'm just a dude on the internet people, not a fucking swami or professional.  I have no clue what you should do with your positions.

I've seen too fucking much speculation lately on just how bad this COVID-19 shit is.  Some say its the sniffles.  Other say its the start to World War Z.  More specifically I've seen this referenced as the next big ""Black Swan"" event because this sub is a bunch of fucking amateurs (myself included) and they just regurgitate whatever bullshit movie or book they read and used to self-proclaim themselves the next Michael Burry (see what I just did there?  I'm speaking your language).

&#x200B;

I've read my fair share of shit too assholes.  The Big Short, Liars Poker, Flash Boys, Chaos Monkeys, Zero To One, the new /r/WallStreetBets book (which doesn't come in a fucking hardcover and looks like a fucking disgrace in my library).  What I have come to realize is there is no fucking science to stocks.  \[Yes there is, you claim.  Stonks only go up.  Science duh\].

&#x200B;

However there is science to a virus works and how a pandemic spreads.  So I've thrown together some half-assed research that you can disregard at your pleasure.  This includes charts that we are all so fond of reading.  Full disclosure, I am not a biologist, doctor, or any expert in the field of virology.  I just did some internet readings and used that data to apply my own logic.  Undoubtedly there are errors in what lies ahead.  Let's begin.

&#x200B;

COVID-19 Coronavirus is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a incestuous relative of our old friend SARS (we'll get to him shorty).  Depending on what you believe this has been caused by some starving Chinese peasants seasoning their soup with bats or the result of a Chinese bioweapon escaping its lab.  Long story short its the flu that really fucks you up.

This isn't the first virus we've seen rapidly rise to fame.  We've got a few historical examples we can look to for comparison.

&#x200B;

1) 1918 H1N1 aka Spanish Flu

The big bad granddaddy of them all, this is the shit doomsdayers point to when they want to really incite some fear.  Firs appearing in January of 1918, this fucker infected almost 500 million and killed anywhere between 40 million to 100 million.  \~28% of the United States was infected with a 2%-3% case-fatality ratio.  

&#x200B;

2) 1956-1958 H2N2 Influenza A aka Asian Flu

A bad nickname since most of these could be called Asian Flu.  This gets the crown since it was first.  Originating in our dear friend China, this spread to Singapore by February of 1957, Hong Kong by April, and the US by June.  69800 deaths in the US with 1-4 million worldwide (WHO estimates 2 million).

&#x200B;

3) 1968-1969 H3N2 Influenza A aka Hong Kong Flu

Arriving on the scene July 13th, 1968, this hit Vietnam and Singapore by the end of July and was widespread in the US by December of 1968.  Case-fatality ratio of 0.5%, it killed 33800 people in the US alone.

&#x200B;

4) 2002-2003 SARS

Probably the last real panic over an Asian virus, this was declared in November 27th of 2002.  There apparently still is no cure.  That said, only 8098 cases with 774 deaths occurred (however that is a fatality rate of 9.6%).  There were only 27 US cases.

&#x200B;

5) 2009 H1N1/09 variation aka Swine Flu

What looked to be the sequel to SARS but really was just a lame prequel, this had a case-fatality of 0.01%-0.08%.  WHO statistics as of July 2010 attributed 18000 deaths to the virus, but later revisions estimate somewhere around 284,500 deaths.

&#x200B;

All of these have led to COVID-19 and speculation is rampant as to it's impact on the globe.  More specifically for the retards here, it's impact on their portfolios.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately we don't have a ton of good data on how any of these affected markets.  For starters, the stock market today is quite different from 20 years ago, and the global economy is much more entangled.  News travels faster, and we have a way of sensationalizing everything.  We can look at the markets during each of the aforementioned virus' (minus the 1918 Spanish Flu.  If this happens there won't be a stock market).

The most recent two virus', H1N1/09 and SARS, both have unusable market data.  Why?  Because when both virus' struck, we had just popped two of the largest bubbles in history.  H1N1/09 struck in March of 2009, right in the midst of the Great Recession.  The market had already bottomed, the Feds were writing blank checks, and the economy was already in triage.  SARS came to fruition in November of 2002, one month after the NASDAQ hit bottom from the DotCom bubble.  What impact these virus' had on the world market is tainted by the preexisting financial landslides.

In January of 1957 the S&P 500 was valued around \~418 (inflation adjusted).  When the virus hit the US in June, the S&P 500 was actual up to \~434.86.  By December of 1957 the index value was 363.23 points.

I feel however, that the 1968 Hong Kong Flu is our best comparison to COVID-19 and any impact the virus could have on the overall market.  Just look at these numbers.

&#x200B;

S&P 500 (inflation adjusted)

July 1968           722.49 (virus reaches Singapore and Vietnam)

December 1968       754.75 (widespread in the United States)

February 1969       707.12

August 1969         665.90

June 1970           483.52

&#x200B;

H3N2 struck a year before the Recession of 1969-1970, a recession that ended the third longest period of economic expansion in US History.  According to Wikipedia:

""At the end of the expansion inflation was rising, possibly a result of increased deficit spending during a period of full employment. This relatively mild recession coincided with an attempt to start closing the budget deficits of the Vietnam War (fiscal tightening) and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates (monetary tightening).\[2\]  During this relatively mild recession, the Gross Domestic Product of the United States fell 0.6 percent. Though the recession ended in November 1970, the unemployment rate did not peak until the next month. In December 1970, the rate reached its height for the cycle of 6.1 percent.""

However I would once again argue this is a poor example, as the market didn't seem to rock much during the actual outbreak, and some of the surrounding factors of the recession were different than those of today.

So what does this mean?  In my opinion we are facing a somewhat unknown scenario.  Markets don't like unknowns.  And there is a lot of fear being tossed around regarding this virus.  Markets don't like fear either.  So is this unknown fear worth panicking about?

&#x200B;

Let's look a pair of charts.  Some really unhappy charts.

This first one graphs all the cases of COVID-19 since its inception on December 31st, 2019, the day China contacted WHO and let them know shit was about to get fucked.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sd9u8lu40gj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=72b0923a47fb0c2c19336440d8e86486c1c45341

For the first month of that chart, you don't really see much.  Then you see one really big fucking line go parabolic in a hurry, and more recently a bunch of little tiny lines that don't seem to be doing anything.  That first line is the number of total COVID-19 cases, dominated by primarily China (>95%).  China has had a runaway explosion of cases that \*tentatively\* seems to be slowing down.  Already the panic from this has caused our recent markets to approach/enter correction territory in the matter of a week.

&#x200B;

Now lets go zoom in on those tiny lines:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/09ubl9360gj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7529cf1eaedf0c4a4019c3e19da0515ce5fe9f97

Holy shit, they are fucking going parabolic too.  After a rough incubation period of about a month, we start seeing an explosion of cases in infected countries.  South Korea has especially been taking it through the teeth.  These are fucking exponential jumps.  If these were stocks, they'd be memed to death already.  If you were investing in virus outbreaks in countries, you can bet your fucking ass most of this sub would be buying calls on every fucking one of these nations with new cases.

&#x200B;

So lets see, we have an economy that is nonsensical, in a trade war with a nation who is ground zero for a sweeping health crisis.  We have recession indicators blowing up everywhere, fucking Twitch streamers jumping into stocks, markets getting spooked to death over this virus, global supply chains being interrupted, the Feds pumping the markets desperately, and now this virus has decided to start going apeshit?

&#x200B;

WHO declared this an international health emergency on January 22nd.  WHO has YET to declare this a pandemic.  We overtook the SARS death toll on February 9th, three weeks ago.  People went nuts about SARS.  According to Wikipedia in regards to Swine Flu, ""Critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading ""fear and confusion"" rather than ""immediate information"". The WHO began an investigation to determine whether it had ""frightened people unnecessarily""'.  So if WHO took flak for overselling Swine Flu in 2009, I would wager they are underselling COVID-19 now.  

Did you watch that speech last night people?  What about any of this is inspiring confidence?  I don't want to imagine what the presser would be if the number of US cases went parabolic.  Hell it might already have done so.  This wouldn't be the first time the current administration has fudged numbers.

In just the last week:

Denmark, Estonia, Greece, North Macedonia, Georgia, Norway, Pakistan, Romania, Croatia, Austria, Brazil, Switzerland, Algeria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Israel all reported their FIRST cases.

Iran and Italy have gone parabolic.  South Korea looks like its gonna hit China numbers from a month ago soon.

We have outpaced almost every historical example of a major pandemic BESIDES the 1918 Spanish Flu.  Also this virus is matching the %2-%3 case-fatality ratio.

I'm buying puts out the ass across the next two months.  Could this thing fizzle out and blow over in two months?  Yes of course.  Could this entire post be full of shit and age incredibly poorly by next week?  Absolutely.  But this sub isn't about investing its about white collar gambling.  You have to take the odds when they are in your favor.  An overextended market gets hit by an unprecedented external force?  The odds have titled.  It's time to lay down some fat fucking bets while it exists.   Or keep throwing money stupidly at meme stocks and hoping SPCE moves 2 fucking points.

Edit 2: In the mere hours since I posted this gibberish, Kuwait, Switzerland, Iran, the UK, South Korea, Iraq, Finland, and Lebanon have reported more cases and deaths.  Australia says pandemic inevitable, the US has 
its first case of unknown origin who wasn't tested for days, and Saudis Arabia just cancelled the fucking pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.   After a few hours sleep I feel even more confident in this assessment.

DD,DD on GILD 🚀 💰 - The company that will 🛑 the 🍺 🦠 while making us lots of 💰 💵 💰,118,fb5fpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fb5fpz/dd_on_gild_the_company_that_will_the_while_making/,123,1582970128.0,"Alright fellow autists, here’s why GILD has the best chance to win the Coronavirus 🍺 🦠 biotech horse 🐎 race. 

As I’m sure you’ve already hear, GILD developed an anti viral medication called Remdesivir, THE only treatment endorsed by the WHO. Bruce Aylward, senior advisor and international leader of the World Health Organization's China COVID-19 mission, said “There's only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy. And that's remdesivir."" 

Here’s all the proof as to why GILD will be shooting up like a rocket over the next few weeks: 🚀 💰
-Gilead is a solid company with many successful drugs in the market. They’re profitable with a Market Cap of over $87Billion and sitting on about $26Billion in cash. Not to mention they’re a virus specialist. For decades they have thrived on their HIV (a Lentivirus) therapy. 

-Gilead had the advantage since this is an anti-viral treatment while other companies are working on vaccines 💉 that will take way longer to get approved. 


💊About Remdesivir:
Remdesivir has been used to treat humans against Ebola (a Filovirus). Remdesivir specifically attacks a part of the virus that's common to all coronaviruses including COVID-19. The drug has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal models against the viral pathogens MERS and SARS, which are also coronaviruses and are structurally similar to COVID-19. Bioinformatically, the target of Remdesivir is very similar to that in the SARS coronavirus, 99% similar and 96% identical. 

💊More about the drug:

-Remdesivir has already proven effective in lab tests against a range of coronaviruses.

-Remdesivir worked against various coronaviruses in mice.

-Remdesivir has been shown to prevent and cure monkeys (rhesus macaques) afflicted with the MERS coronavirus. [link](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/12/1922083117)

-Remdesivir worked against even the most divergent coronavirus called Porcine deltacoronavirus. [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682219303010)

-Remdesivir has been proven to work against every coronavirus tested against whether in lab or animals.

—A U.S. patient and a French COVID-19 patient both recovered after being administered Remdesivir on a compassionate use basis.  (translated with Google translate): ""The 48-year-old patient infected with the new coronavirus and released from the Bordeaux University Hospital on Thursday, after 22 days of hospitalization, was treated with remdesivir, a ""promising"" antiviral, said his medical team on Friday."" [here’s the article](https://www.la-croix.com/France/Nouveau-coronavirus-patient-Bordeaux-recu-remdesivir-2020-02-14-1301078321)

🧪Gilead next moves:

-Clinical Trials: Gilead-initiated Phase 3 Clinical Trials Initiating March 2020. Clinical trial results are anticipated in April 2020. 

-Compassionate Use: Gilead is working with government and non-government organizations and regulatory authorities to provide remdesivir to patients with COVID-19 for emergency treatment in the absence of any approved treatment options.

-Increasing Manufacturing Capacity and Supply: There are currently limited available clinical supplies of remdesivir but Gilead is working to increase its available supply as rapidly as possible.

-The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, has initiated a Phase II adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial into remdesivir as a potential treatment for hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19. [link](http://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/coronaviruses)

-CDC officials told the medical team treating the infected man in Washington about Remdesivir after his condition worsened. Meaning both WHO and CDC are currently recommending this as a last resort compassionate use option.

But let's take a look at its effects on gold, specifically the **ETF:GLD**.

&#x200B;

Let us take a look at the numbers.

On January 4th 2016, GLD was 103.13

February 1st 2016, WHO declares Zika an outbreak, GLD was 107.54.

July 29th 2016, CDC confirms 4 cases of Zika in Florida, GLD was 125.91.

August 29th 2016, CDC confirms more cases of Zika in Florida, GLD was 126.00.

September 19th 2016, CDC lifts travel advisory in Florida, GLD was 125.32.

The year would end with GLD at 109.61.

Between these given dates, GLD reached a **high of 130.52 on July 28th, 2016.**

&#x200B;

GLD is slowly declining from a recent surge. Take what you want from this information, but from what I can tell viruses or diseases spreading lead to a high in GLD (which most of you probably already know), and I believe we have already reached that high.  

&#x200B;

EDIT: In regards to come comments saying that the Fed lowering interest leads to gold going up, according to these sources, there is no correlation to that. In some cases, raising the interest rate actually helps gold. See below.

I believe markets are underestimating the spread of the Coronavirus in Brazil, and I believe the ""smart money"" is chasing this hypothesis.

Global Coronavirus heatmaps indicate Brazil has one confirmed case (as of this post):

* https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html

* https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-map-confirmed-cases-2020-n1120686

I believe the true number of cases may be much higher.  Just like Germany, Brazil recently held Carnival - hundreds of thousands of people in confined space doing who knows what.

* https://www.insider.com/brazil-carnival-festival-parade-photos-rio-de-janeiro-2020-2

Long incubation period + close proximity + mass groups of people = rise in confirmed cases and negative market reaction (that's the theory anyway).  

Is anyone else looking into this?  Looking at EWZ you wouldn't necessarily think so.  They've followed similar percentage declines as the S&P 500.  But, using Google Trends, there has been a spike in ""Coronavirus Brazil"" searches and in the past month there has been a parabolic rise in these searches coming from. . .  New York and D.C., among others.  

* https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&geo=US&q=Brazil%20Coronavirus

Now do we think there's a localized group of Brazilian nationals centered in financial districts frantically searching for what's going on in Brazil?  Or, since the amount of information coming out of South America is a fraction of the Western world, are hedge funds and speculators trying to get a leg up?

What's the point?  I'm not a doctor but I recall the 2016 Summer Olympics where Brazil couldn't keep algae from growing in a pool.  

* https://qz.com/755164/why-did-the-olympic-diving-pool-turn-green/

Despite years of preparation (i.e., knowing the Olympics were coming), event organizers couldn't keep algae from growing in an outdoor pool for two weeks.  Do you think they are prepared to handle an epidemic?  I hope so because these are people we're talking about.  Hoping for minimal quarantines and speedy recoveries, but hedging against downside.

This is not a post PRO or CON on Corona or any specific stock.  This is Harvard Medical's Corona FAQ.  (THANK YOU HARVARD) Use accordingly to make your Bull and Bear plays.  In being respectful to Harvard please use the site directly.. I've taken a few summary points for the short read.

[https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/as-coronavirus-spreads-many-questions-and-some-answers-2020022719004](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/as-coronavirus-spreads-many-questions-and-some-answers-2020022719004)

the virus can spread from one person to another, most likely through  droplets of saliva or mucus carried in the air for up to six feet or so  when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through viral particles  transferred when shaking hands or sharing a drink with someone who has  the virus.

An  incubation period is the time between catching an illness and showing  symptoms of the illness. Current estimates suggest that symptoms of  COVID-19 usually appear within around five days or less in most cases,  but the range could be between one and 14 days.

Fever,  dry cough, trouble breathing, and sometimes pneumonia are the common  symptoms of COVID-19. There have been some reports of gastrointestinal  symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) before respiratory symptoms  occur, but this is largely a respiratory virus.

Those who have the  virus may have no obvious symptoms (be asymptomatic) or symptoms  ranging from mild to severe. In some cases, the virus is  life-threatening or fatal.

No vaccine is available, although scientists are working on vaccines. In 2003, scientists tried to develop a vaccine to prevent [SARS](https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-sars.html) but the epidemic ended before the vaccine could enter clinical trials.

Currently  there is no specific antiviral treatment for this new coronavirus.  Treatment is therefore supportive, which means giving fluids, medicine  to reduce fever, and, in severe cases, supplemental oxygen. People who  become critically ill from COVID-19 may need a respirator to help them  breathe. Bacterial infection can complicate this viral infection.  Patients may require antibiotics in cases of bacterial pneumonia as well  as COVID-19.

A  specialized test must be done to confirm that a person has COVID-19.  Most testing in the US has been performed at the CDC. However, the goal  is to send test kits to state laboratories so testing can be performed  locally.

As of  February 25, 2020, the reported confirmed cases and deaths in China  suggest the mortality rate is roughly 3%. It is important to remember  that early on in an epidemic there is a “tip of the iceberg” phenomenon  where we overestimate more severe cases and mild or asymptomatic cases  go unrecognized, so the mortality seems higher than the reality.

Obviously APT already skyrocketed, and even MMM went up a little the last two days. MMM is too large to really go up just on mask sales. But there's a company that doesn't just make masks but makes ALL the stuff you need to survive coronavirus.

[Kimberly Clark is the \*\*third largest N95 mask manufacturer\*\*](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/top-suppliers/surgical-mask-manufacturer-suppliers/) by sales revenue. So that's a pretty obvious boost to mask sales, whatever.

But what happens to all the people who get coronavirus and AREN'T sick enough to be hospitalized? They sit at home coughing and blowing their nose into KLEENEX TISSUES. Only 20% or less of people with coronavirus get sick enough to need a hospital-everyone else is just at home using endless Kleenex.

People are also **panic buying hand sanitizer**. Hand sanitizer is sold out on [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), all the local store shelves are empty of Purell (seriously, I checked Targets everywhere and even the stores claiming that it's in stock don't have it because they got kleptoed). [KMB is also a huge manufacturer of hand sanitizer](https://www.kcprofessional.com/en-us/products/skin-care-dispensers/hand-sanitizer) for both consumers and commercial facilities.

So we have a company that literally makes MASKS, HAND SANITIZER, and TISSUES but hasn't spiked in price yet. Sales of half the crap they make are going nuts. They're too large of a company to have a batshit run like APT but I can see this going back up to to the $150's when the public realizes KMB is selling half the shit people are hoarding during an outbreak.

All the OTHER shit they make also doesn't stop selling during a pandemic. Are you going to stop using tampons just because people have the beerflu? Are you going to let your kids shit their pants and not buy your Huggies? Hell no, all their other products will keep selling like they always have. Sales can only go up massively.

EDIT: Since idiots are claiming that hand sanitizer doesn't work against coronavirus I'm gonna point out that it's [**literally recommended by the CDC**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html) for preventing COVID-19 from spreading so stop posting bullshit about how it's not antiviral.",2020-02-28 19:02:47

Meanwhile, stock to cash held has increased from 253.66% on 2/19, 428.75% on 2/25 to a whopping 950% yesterday.

The swap notional value is $9b as of yesterday's close.

No one knows for sure. But consider the following data:

1. Past outbreaks over 20 years have seen SP 500 down from 6-13% (we are in the middle of that range)
2. We see recovery fairly quickly historically- in months (exact data linked below)
3. With points one and two in mind I would expect a little more pain though is possible because a) we have a hit to a manufacturing sector b) retail leverage and stock marker prices are at an all time high
4. Media outlets only care about the ""dramatic"" - the will say ""worst drop ever""  ""1,000 points"" etc. They will start to reference ""points"" vs percentage in headlines for the dramatic effect (a 1,000 point now is not as significant as a 1,000 drop a decade ago)
5. Expect wild swings due to retail investors who never saw a drop and leverage being used - especially in the afternoons as people get margin called.
6. Dramatic increases in volume will also be a sign of a bottom (The Bottom) as people finally ""give up"" and go back to their fast food job
7. The hit to China is UNDER estimated while the hit to the USA is OVER estimated.  We are not China. I spent a lot of time there... Friends and Family from China travel to the US for products and health care.  China has almost no healthcare and shit sanitation.  If they are not all dead the virus cannot be that bad.  The USA is one of the cleanest countries with the best hygiene. We consume most the worlds deodorant. Any thought of a germ freaks us out. We will be fine.
8. WSB will mostly get it wrong (sorry) - especially with all the new guys in due to FOMO.

Buy calls on QGEN. They specialize in lab testing, and even if the virus doesn't take off to the point where vaccines are needed, lab testing will be needed one way or another. [CDC's testing](https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download) recommends rNA testers by them, which led me to look into them and saw [this article](https://corporate.qiagen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2020/20200226_coronavirus) about how they're shipping out testing kits. Also, it probably helps that they are well respected and widely used for other testing and lab supplies within the medical community. I'm just a poor boy, so I got 1 contract of 4/17 $38 CALL this morning, and it's already up quite a bit today. 

As panic spreads, more people will want to be tested for the virus (even with the slightest of coughs) and this company is supplying those testing kits (or at the very least, parts of the official CDC kits). I'll probably sell off some more stuff tomorrow to buy more calls, which I'm thinking of aiming for after their Q1 earnings would be announced for as high as I can afford.

1. Their media lies and only speculate that they are recovering. Leading indicators like PMI tell a different story.
2. They went absolutely ballistic in their response due to SARS fears.
3. No other country (except Singapore) is taking the crackdown response China has. Other countries are gonna take a harder hit than China.
4. The US in particular was inflated. You all think its from fed injection and repo markets but let me tell you, the massive bull run was primarily due to the weakness of the global economy.
5. The world had a TINA market for the US. Foreign countries were injecting money to prop their economies up... and this money got quickly invested into the US as a safe haven. Just look at Italy's 2019 debt bubble.

(Hint: domestic funds stopped investing as much cash into the US starting in 2016. We also didn't inject enough money into market to make up for the increased market cap, even if 100% were immediately invested.)

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, Chinese supply chain is a huge indicator for us. Wu flu started in 2019 and we are barely feeling it now in 2020. It'll be months before we can even think about recovering, even if China is recovered (and they're not.)

My notes from the call today. TL;DR at bottom for you illiterate degenerates.

Anyways:

* Movers
   * Big pharma to visit WH Monday to discuss detection solutions, possibly vaccines.
      * No name mentioned, just 'industry'
      * Original meeting was to discuss lowering pharma costs (so Trump said).
   * 3M contracted for 35M more masks. Markets may have reacted to this Friday (see: [https://ibb.co/nrP5n1y](https://ibb.co/nrP5n1y)). Hard to say. I just like pretty pictures don't @ me.
   * Travel bans and restrictions announced, more considered. Airlines gonna be hurting.
* Markets
   * ""Fed should be doing more"".
      * Wants lower rates for us, as well as to refinance debt for a better rate.
      * Compared us to other countries with lower rates.
      * No specifics mentioned outside of doing more, lowering rates.
   * This is just a funny side note: 10 minutes later, responding to another question, Trump said market will take care of itself. lmao
   * Asked directly about gov't intervention (i.e., tax cuts). NO TAX CUTS to accelerate market.
      * Declined to say they were considering anything not already announced (read you idiots: priced in) such as the middle-income tax later this year.
* New travel restrictions
   * Travel BANNED from Iran
   * Travel advisory level 4 (highest) from parts of S. Korea and Italy (where infected people are duh).
      * Also talking to those gov't about medical screening for incoming travel.
* Virus Specifics
   * lmao don't be around sick people.
   * Will see more cases.
   * Literally said ""Do not panic"".
   * Honestly seems like they're making serious efforts to contain it. We'll see how it plays out in practice.

&#x200B;

Summary

Long or short big pharma, who fucking knows. Wanting to discuss lowering prices is probably going to cause fear for investors around profits, but having the WH dick in your honeypot for the cure to the beer flu probably looks good. Goodluck on this.

3M Long, prior to Jan 28th traded for >175, sits at 150. My play would be 4/17 170c and wait for tendies. Will probably spike up though Monday morning on briefing, so, you know, buy high you idiots.

Short AAL, UAL, SAVE, DAL, etc. Further restrictions likely coming.

Didn't really inspire confidence in market but I wouldn't be surprised by a statement from JP Sunday night re: rate cuts and an optimistic market moving into Tuesday. After that who fucking knows I'm not an oracle, just a gambler with a problem.

As always, disclaimer: My positions are 3/2 3/4 3/6 and 3/6 puts on SPY.

Many of those deals have been adjusted for future generations but boomers still collect on the gravy train deals from the 60s and 70s. Once corona kills many of them off, states will have a lot more money for infrastructure deals, get lower rates due to better credit ratings. So municipal funds are a good buy now, you get tax free money in dividends and you're going to see a bump in price after investors see the high rates collected are as good as it gets and pile in before the lower rates get in. 

I like DTF because...duh, FMN and any other municipal based funds that lend to pension obligated municipalities. More of a long term play than a quick bet, but if you guys see any of these funds with options, go for leaps.

Also short any retirement homes shit. Like LTC, a retirement home exclusive REIT

I dare say, things are not as dire as to incite a full on crisis a la 2008-09.

From **The China Response & Next Steps**:

> In the face of a previously unknown virus, **China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history.** The strategy that underpinned this containment effort was initially a national approach that promoted universal temperature monitoring, masking,and hand washing. However, as the outbreak evolved,and knowledge was gained, a science and risk-based approach was taken to tailor implementation. **Specific containment measures were adjusted to the provincial, county and even community context**, the capacity of the setting, and the nature of novel coronavirus transmission there.

This by itself is a remarkable achievement for a demographic as enormous as China's, which is still not in the ""developed"" world ranks.

> China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic.A particularly compelling statistic is that on the first day of the advance team’s work there were 2478 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported in China. Two weeks later, on the final day of this Mission, China reported 409 newly confirmed cases. **This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real.**

The decline is *real*. Before we go full-on conspiracy retards, consider that WHO experts are staking their reputation on that assessment. I don't claim that *this is it*, the virus is contained globally (more on that late), but the source has been neutralised to a great extent. It might take a few months, but there is a real possibility of these few weeks being the peak for this virus contamination.

> **China is already, and rightfully, working to bolster its economy, reopen its schools and return to a more normal semblance of its society, even as it works to contain the remaining chains of COVID-19 transmission.** Appropriately, a science-based, risk-informed and phased approach is being taken, with a clear recognition and readiness of the need to immediately react to any new COVID-19 cases or clusters as key elements of the containment strategy are lifted.

We all saw [the record drop in China's PMI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-29/china-feb-manufacturing-pmi-at-35-7-est-45-0?srnd=economics-vp) earlier this morning/late night. But the turning point might have been reached. Not saying that ya'll should go full retard on Calls now, but future strategy has to be informed on present change in momentum. All the big institutional investors simply closed their positions to avoid heavy losses *now*, but they'll be back to pick up stocks at dirt-cheap prices in a month or two.

**BUTT** (and there's a big one here), it is on the rest of the world to limit the contagion. Lots of work to be done there. Thankfully, China has for once set a respectable example for rest of the world (**The Global Response & Next Steps**):

> China’s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response

> **Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China.**

So there will be a lot of ""BREAKING NEWS"" going around, ramping up the hysteria and fear, going anus-deep in every new case to make it sound like the End Times. People are bored, they want something ""exciting"" to worry about. Human nature. This virus is definitely a massive check on global economy, but it might not be the ""Black Swan"" event that people are making it out to be. For that to happen, there needs to be a *Fundamental* shift in global economics and finance. We are not quite there yet, despite the inverted yield curves, negative yields on bonds, slowing growth. The bubbles are not massive enough to pop yet.

Best of luck, autists.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR**: DON'T FUCKING GO ALL IN ON CALLS, *YET*. But this is not the Black Swan event people are making it out to be. It will be rough, like wiping your ass with sandpaper, but also have a pleasurable after-effect, once it's over. Trust me on that.",2020-02-29 14:59:43

DD,Current economy as a transfer function,55,fc5k1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc5k1v/current_economy_as_a_transfer_function/,139,1583146930.0,"Ok, in engineering we learn about Transfer functions. Take a complex system and distill it down to a black box. You can test inputs and outputs and see the results based on the transfer function of the model.

Economics is just a massive number of transfer functions that are merged into several final transfer function that is the SP500, DOW, Hang Seng, etc. Each transfer function can consist of any number smaller transfer functions; some of these are highly coupled, some are not.

Transfer functions can be stable or unstable, depending on the feedback method. FIR, IIR, pick your poison. Regardless of the model, when implementing in a real system, you will either:

* Work as predicted
* Oscillate at a certain frequency
* Damp to 0
* Explode to one system energy points (voltage, photons, whatever)

The bottom 3 results are pretty worthless, as any number of input signals can be interpreted as the same thing and the whole system is worthless. Any large change to the input signal can cause instability and lead to the last 3 results. Oscillation is rare, but should always be considered, but probably not in this example.

My theory, backed by anecdotal Twitter / WSB / Reddit, is that we are about to hit one of the last 3 outputs of a system, not in a good way. 

The Iran Drone Strike is an example of a high energy, short term event, which can be handled by most systems. COVID19 is a high energy, long term event that most systems will either damp to 0 or explode to one of the power supply rails, both results are essentially the same.

Worse, there are subsystems and phase delays we haven't even talked about. The supply chain is an example of a subsystem that has a phase delay of weeks or months. I request an order from China, they fill it 3 weeks later. That phase delay has been modeled correctly for years, until now.

Injecting more energy (money) into the system doesn't help.

TLDR: We are going to damp to 0 or rail to a voltage until we disconnect the input signal and reset power to the system. Injecting more energy doesn't help.",2020-03-02 06:02:10

DD,The new move on Monday: Puts on PG,77,fc1yd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc1yd6/the_new_move_on_monday_puts_on_pg/,37,1583130869.0,"The stock market is going to open red on Monday, and probably fall this week just like before. China's manufacturing is still taking a shit, the virus is spreading like crazy in France, Germany, the UK, USA, Spain, Italy, and South Korea (all of which are globally relevant nations), China's new cases per day are accelerating again, and Trump told the market to fuck off on his briefing on Saturday, saying the virus is his only concern and that the stock market can take care of itself.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, the IV of options on all stocks is quite high lately. Look at the shit people (including myself) have options on right now - TQQQ? SPY? SQQQ? IV is huge, this means premiums are high and you're making less profit because the market is essentially pricing in the probability that your put is going to be profitable.

&#x200B;

PG is Procter and Gamble and makes a fuckload of recognizable brands of products, just go look at their list, it's truly astounding. They're a massive corporation. They manufacture 90% or more of their shit in the USA. But, that's final manufacturing of the completed product.

&#x200B;

Guess where the precursors and components they use to finish their products, come from?

&#x200B;

China.

&#x200B;

[Nobody in the USA makes the components. Only China.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/21/news/companies/trump-trade-war-china-procter-and-gamble/index.html)

&#x200B;

Guess what country is still shitting itself from the Omega Flu? Yes, also China. [Their manufacturing PMI was awful](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3052985/coronavirus-chinas-factories-activity-plunges-all-time-low). They're not ""back online."" Manufacturing isn't back to normal yet.

&#x200B;

[105p 03/27 only costs 1.88](https://prnt.sc/ra124j), that'll go up on Monday (since Monday is definitely going to be red), but you can load up on these, watch PG tank over the next week, and sell for easy money. IV is lower than indexes - especially the leveraged indexes like SQQQ - and they're *going* to fall more. You don't need to wait for them to fall to 90 or some bullshit, you buy during a spike in the market on Monday, wait until later in the week to sell for 50% gains (which would only require about a $4 dip in their price, which is less than 4%, and the entire market including PG has experienced drops of a similar degree in intraday trading *multiple* times last week). Could hold for 100% gains, but obviously that's riskier. But this is DD, not shitpost. So I'm advocating this play for 50% returns over the course of a few days, assuming the market continues to slowly bleed itself to death.

DD,DD: Chinese Manufacturing,137,fc1c74,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fc1c74/dd_chinese_manufacturing/,73,1583128362.0,"Listen up, you smoothed brain retards. You think that just because the markets have fallen farther than your pants when you're at the urinal (with your shirt tucked under your chin) that it's time to buy the dip?   


Well that's why you're a smoothed brain retard. we are going to have sustained supply chain disruptions well into Q3 and Q4 that will continue to provide 🌈🐻 gang with the premium non-generic brand tendies. 

China released its Manufacturing PMI on Friday, which was a whopping \*\*35.7\*\*. For context, the lowest it's ever been was 37.8, and that was during november of 2008. Moreover, the only thing that china is consistently good at is lying about official numbers, so that numbers in reality are most likely closer to 25-30.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-february-manufacturing-pmi-drops-162233535.html  


Furthermore, analysts were anticipating that number to be somewhere around 47, but clearly the yoga they have been practicing since new years has gotten them flexible enough to get their heads far enough up their asses to think that quarantining 700 million people in the largest manufacturing country on planet earth would only drop the index by 6-7 points - ie the true consequences of this supply chain disruption hasn't been priced in yet. 

What's the play? any retail that heavily relies on chinese imports. For example, WMT will most likely see the largest hit, as their logistics structures are centered around lean invetory management - meaning that they forecast and order from their vendors every week to keep inventory levels low so they don't waste money on storage and moving unnecessary products. Even if they order enough in large volumes now to get them through the next few months, it will be may-June that they start seeing major disruptions in their product lines because there's nothing coming behind it. And for a retailer that lives on 2-3% margin, they're going to get absolutely ass blasted. 

If WSB wants to really vandalize the markets, start compiling lists of retailers and manufactures that rely on chinese goods - and start looking at puts with expirations of June-July. ",2020-03-02 00:52:42

[S&P500](https://preview.redd.it/ufbbklvlm4k41.png?width=3104&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ba084a2ae053653ccd7134eeac90b359c290f43)

In the last several weeks we saw basically two corrections. The first one was when millions of Chinese were put into quarantine. The S&P500 dropped by 3% and a couple days later, achieved its ATH of 3393.52. This ""correction"" is totally absurd by itself. Nothing was priced in by this time. 3%? You telling me nobody knew about the disruption this would cause to supply chains? The info was right there for everybody that this must cause supply chain disruptions.

Now, last week resulted in a -13% decline from the S&P500 ATH. It started with Apple's warning on revenue guidance and a bunch of other events. Ask yourself: Did this correction price in the current situation of the world (supply chain disruptions) **AND** impact on growth **AND** a possible widespread infection of the EU and the US?

IMHO, this correction *partially* priced in supply chain disruptions, but remains basically completely ignorant of US and EU infections. The market is still priced as if:

* Corona didn't arrive in the US and the EU
* the supply chain disruption is a little -13% inconvenience and not a total clusterfuck
* printing money in the system could fix the problem

tldr: SPY puts strike 270 or lower, next two weeks. I expect at least -20% from ATH (2,714 / $270) or more. Same for DAX and other EU indexes.

I already hold puts worth of \~70K€ on SPY and DAX and am considering buying more.

Patients on chronic dialysis have at least one chronic medical disease (kidney failure) and usually also diabetes and high blood pressure.  They are also usually older people.

Davita makes its money by performing dialysis chronically for patients, fewer patients = less revenue.  It has had a 35% increase in its share price over the last year.

If it loses 8-10% of patients this year and possibly next year earnings will definitely take a hit.

This panic is getting close to overblown for the long term. People still need shit, companies are going to have to make products and provide services. There may be a supply shock in the short term and one analog to look at would be the oil crisis of the early 70s. There was a fierce bear market that dropped the market almost 50% in a year. Stonks are going to do fuck all this year if we start seeing economic effects. 

But I think one possible outcome of this panic that's getting overlooked here is triggering inflation. What's going to happen when products start to become scarce and people need to outbid others for more of them? You guessed it. Yet the 10 year yield hit a record low. I think the coming rout in bond prices will be the next big shoe to drop if we start seeing actual supply shocks. I might wait until we get any announcement from central banks on rate cuts. That should be the final nail in the coffin and should cement an upward price (inflation) spiral. 

This isn't necessarily about the short term supply shock which would sort itself out in a few months, but about central banks overreacting and getting on the wrong side of inflation.  Bond prices will have to crash to reflect higher interest rates as central banks start to play catch up. 

TLDR: start shorting bonds especially if you start hearing talk of rate cuts. This is a contrarian play. TLT puts, or buy TBF, TBX.",2020-03-01 19:38:58
DD,"Short-Term Puts on GLD, Long-Term Call",75,fbwjis,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbwjis/shortterm_puts_on_gld_longterm_call/,47,1583109473.0,"I've been working on a thesis about gold, thinking that there could be some massive tendy potential if played right. Most of this is based of an [article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/28/why-gold-stocks-are-plunging-today.aspx) I read* on Motley Fool with some interesting analysis. 

Surprisingly, gold dropped this week, bad (GLD took a 6% shit this week), despite it's usual safe-haven quality when the market takes a shit. The reason for this is likely that big fucking fish are pulling out all their gold gains (literally a gold mine on the year GLD up 20%) to make up for losses elsewhere.
> However, investors have since started cashing in on their gold gains to raise cash and cover losses in the market. Further, gold investors now think that central banks will work to stimulate economies due to worries of deflation, which is bad for gold since it thrives on inflation.

Same idea was posited in a [marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/theres-a-simple-reason-that-gold-is-falling-along-with-coronavirus-afflicted-global-stocks-2020-02-28)
>This time around, however, given the steep stock-market declines, gold has become the asset of choice among investors to generate cash. “Investors are selling anything with a bid and running for cover, and that includes typical hedges like gold,” said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter.

Both articles though predict that gold will bounce back this week thinking that the worst of the sell-off is already over. But the worst is not over. Rates are not fucking going down, no matter what big daddy Fed tells you. We are not fine. There will be blood on Monday. If this week is going to be even fucking worse than last, and the bulls and boomers are all telling us we're fine when we're not, market is going to plummet again. Monday in a gay bear bloodbath. Big fish are going to need to keep selling their positions on gold for cash to make up for their refusal to accept the god damn bloodbath that's coming. This tells me short-term puts ($144p 3/13) on GLD (also exploring short-term call options on inverse etfs like DUST $10c 3/13 which will give much more leverage) will be dumb profitable while everyone expects gold to bounce back due to traditional haven status. 

On the long though, gold is going to bottom out when the sell-off ends. You won't see it drop more because big fish will stop needing immediate cash when volatility decreases. All the boomers scared of losing their 401(k)s will funnel their money into it and it will go up. Some time this week I'm going to buy some long ass call options (think summer 2021 GLD $180c 6/18/21) on gold thinking they're gonna be cheap as hell and make me some solid tendies.

Feel free to call me an autist or actually a retard, just explain why I am so I can milk your brains for ideas.

Ticker: KOS

Market Cap: $1.2B

Enterprise Value: $3.3B

Current Price: $2.91

Price Target: $6

Implied upside: 105% 

Potential catalyst: Energy Mini-Conference next week in Houston (March 10-12) & oil price stabilization. 

Kosmos Energy Ltd. has had a rough week, exacerbated by the dip in oil prices over the Corona Virus. 

1. Kosmos expects to retain a higher interest in Mauritania and Senegal

Management made the strategic decision to retain a higher stake in its Mauritania and Senegal assets, by holding a larger stake in Tortue. Between the three hubs - Tortue, Birallah and Yakaar Teranga, KOS expected 30 mtpa of LNG capacity to be constructed. The company now expects to retain 5 mtpa of LNG exposure, primarily through a larger stake in Tortue while using the expected asset sales process to fund additional capital spend requirements. While KOS had previously targeted a sale of 20% of the asset (leaving them with a 10% ownership), targeting 5 mtpa of LNG implies the sale of ~13% of the assets (and retaining a ~17% stake). The sales process at Mauritania/Senegal is still in progress; management has seen discussions with different buyer pools including end users, utilities and supermajors.

2. Capital spend requirements to increase post drawdown of the BP carry

Management has pointed to the ~$500 mn BP capex carry ending in mid-2020, with Mauritania and Senegal capex of $250 mn in 2020 once this has been exhausted, but expects additional capex to be funded through its anticipated divestiture program. The capital budget guidance for 2020 of $325 mn to $375 mn does not include the capital for Mauritania and Senegal.

3. KOS provided a more positive update around its Ghana assets

Following negative implications for Kosmos Energy after its JV partner, Tullow, announced a production and resource downgrade at the TEN and Jubilee assets, management has indicated that the partners have since executed a gas handling expansion project, enabling higher gas throughput and ultimately, higher production levels. Production levels have now reached around 90 kbpd, with further work to improve gas compressor reliability to enable stable flows at this rate. KOS has also pointed the addition of a rig in 1H2020, to further underpin consistent production.

Banks are trading so closely to the overall market because they are leveraged to the tits on derivatives. BAC is no exception. A rate cut helps the underlying assets perform, but cuts at their core business, making money from interest. 

Banks can handle a shit market OR 0% rates, but NOT BOTH. 

If the rate cuts fail to stimulate growth, the banks will be in big trouble. Not only will their derivatives be at risk, their liquid assets will not appreciate. 

The FED is taking a big risk at dropping rates like this. It will force banks to make even riskier investments to make money. It won't happen overnight, but if the market stays in a downtrend long enough and rates stay low long enough, we're looking at a serious shitshow.

Direction: **Neutral Bearish**

**Price Target:** **14$**

**Type: Calendar Strangle**

**Fundamental:** Tilray was originally one of the biggest IPO winners in 2018. However, the hype and the demand both died down as reality set in. Tilray is currently cutting workforce as well, showing some weakness in its operation model. TLRY currently does not generate a profit, though it is look at 250%+ YoY revenue growth. Whether the market accepts this growth is up for debate, especially in current macro environments.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 40, oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and bullish open interest. Implied movement is 18.4% or about 2.6$ Short interest is at 8%, with 4.6 days to cover.

**Sentimental**: Coming off a massive beat from CGC, Tilray is aiming to repeat its success through huge topline (not bottom) beats. Continuing on the CGC thought process, the stock had held its highs for 2 days before it came crashing down again. I believe this is due to current macro conditions that hurts speculative plays such as cannabis and fake meat. Even with a beat under its belt, there are currently safer and more profitable stocks on sale. **This is a contrarian call against option sentiments. Be careful**

You know who you are. You are probably losing money on puts right now.

My previous post about this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei8vl1/my\_last\_buy\_of\_the\_second\_decade\_of\_the\_21st/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ei8vl1/my_last_buy_of_the_second_decade_of_the_21st/)

The company owns various social media platforms that mainly catter to regions other than NA and Europe. Mostly China, the ME and India. That doesn't sound to exciting but bear with me for a sec. Let's talk fundamentals. Over the last 4 years the company has had an average revenue growth of 40%, EPS ratio of 13. The company is currently profitable. 50% revenue growth from 2018 to 2019 AND current revenue (taking into account 2019 and 2018 reports) is sitting at 3.14 Billion USD. And posted net income (after deducting every possible expense) was half a billion dollars in the same period. Balance sheet looks healthy, low debt and doesn't have problems meeting it's debt obligations.

So you have a company that is healthy, great revenues, great revenue growth and fat margins. Tbh, I'm completely and absolutely befuddled about what could possibly the market be telling us about a company. In theory this should be impossible. This company, compared to $TWTR or $SNAP is an absolute winner in every possible way. Yet, the market currently values YY at around 4 Billion dollars.

Right now the company is trading at a crazy low valuation given the corona scare. It has a pretty significant support at 52, so you'd be entering the trade with theoretical 5% downside risk, I honestly don't see this going any lower than that unless, the HQ explodes or something.

My positions:

&#x200B;

$YY calls 04172020 strike 60

$YY calls 01152020 strike 85

TL;DR Company is stupidly undervalued. Have no idea why. Trading near it's significant support.

At first I thought AAPL was obvious, due to their China exposure, but there are a lot of ways it can go sideways…same with semiconductors, etc. I’m was sticking to my DAL puts this morning but sold.

In light of the nursing home fatalities in Washington State, I decided to look at specific industries that the virus will affect long term: industries with exposure to old people. Its pretty dark, I know, but you gotta find value where its not being efficiently measured.

1. If things continue like they are, senior living facilities are going to be hit hard. These are the people that are “ground zero” for the virus. Right now is supposedly only kills 15% of the 80+ demographic and 8% of the 70 +, you also need to factor in the risk of what happens when the medical system is overwhelmed.
2. Additionally, you need to factor in the optics of it…boomers are really motivated by fear, moreso than other generations. You have a natural animosity towards “going into a home” and now, when these homes are going to see REALLY high mortality rates, I think it will hurt the long term outlook for them. Imagine a senior assisted living / nursing home REIT that suddenly loses 15% of its tenants, possibly more, another few % flee their lease to get out and stay with family, while simultaneously decreasing the “next generation” of tenants through some mortality but also the optics of these areas being “ground zero”.
3. I looked around at REITS for this and settled on Welltower $WELL. Its not a nursing home play, but rather, 55% of its income is derived from private payers (people with money—see people with options to leave if they want). These REITS already have slightly higher vacancy rates than others, and if you see a 15-20% decrease in tenants over the next year, it’ll hit them hard. This also gives you a play on real estate as a whole which, if anything is guaranteed, a Chinese housing crunch will lead to similar housing crunch here, which is likely in the next year. Sure, fed rate cuts will help REITS, but look at how Japan’s 90s crunch affected our housing market. $WELL's facilities are largely in urban centers like NYC. If the virus does what its doing in other areas, these facilities will be hit harder due to their demographic and geographic location.

Some alternative plays here are $OHI and $PEAK, but I avoided each of these for various reasons. OHI is nursing homes and people that are in there don't generally have financial flexibility to leave (OHI derives its income from medicare). $PEAK is less of a pure play.

TL/DR: Shorting senior living REITS (non gov-reliant) due to the virus’ targeting these areas, and then playing on the resulting disinclination for people to live in these facilities. I picked up some $WELL puts today, may buy some more soon.

[https://imgur.com/a/PtnTRMx](https://imgur.com/a/PtnTRMx)

Long story short, I still think they market has not fully grasped what this is and early this week is a good point to start betting on either a small bounce with a precipitous drop to come while hedging against a complete recovery.  Nothing but bad news came out this weekend and I think the market corrected on the idea of a China disruption and eventual virus containment.  Large events being cancelled is signaling to the market that there is still a belief that this can be contained.  I don't think they have ""priced in"" the idea that this virus won't be contained, or they have and this week is a huge trap to get some last bit of dinero.  

""It's just the flu!"" - normal flu doesn't kill like this.  Normal flu doesn't put 10% of the world's population in quarantine.

""Summer is coming, that will stop the virus"" - Singapore, Thailand, Australia, and even Ecuador are seeing a rise in cases.  Ecuador - that's the damn equator.  It's perpetual summer there.

""This is an overreaction.  Media just hyping it up"" - called my mother back in the midwest this last week - she hadn't even heard of it.  We haven't even come close to peak fear levels yet imo.  US cases is still under 100 and we just had our first death.

In the Kubler-Ross Grief Cycle, we are still in denial.

I'm looking for a good entry point today and then wagering half my \~5k portfolio, saving the other half in reserve in case I'm terribly wrong or terribly right.   I would also bet on me being terribly wrong.   This is not a ""safe"" investment.  This is a ""I drive a 24 year old car that's dying and want a new one, but I also have a really solid job and if I'm wrong I'm only out next weeks paycheck and that's just $2.5k less I can blow in Vegas in a few weeks"".

The market is currently in a downtrend and doesnt look thats going to stop. A 50bp cut on interest rates gave it an erection before the erection decided to become flaccid, like my dick after I see Winker's mum.

10 Year Bond Yield went below 1% for the first time in history. At the time of writing it is 0.965%. Thats bloody low. 

For the people who dont know what bond yields indicate. The lower the yield, the less confident the market is in the market and they trust the US govt more than the stock market. 

Japan owns the most debt of all countries out off all nations except of course the USA. It's current debt holdings stand at $1.15trillion. Its GDP is around $5.3trillion dollars. Its last GDP report showed negative GDP growth and if it gets another report of negative growth - its called a recession for Japan at that point.


With China being under lockdown still, global trade slowing down, yields going down and Japan on the brink of a recession. EWJ puts are the best play. Japan's age demographic is old. In 2014, estimates were 33% were over 60. 25% 65+ and 13% 75+. While compared to the US, its 39% for 45+. With intrapolation, thats around 25% over 60 in 2010..

The median age in Japan is 48.4 while in the US is 37.5

Japan is also considering cancelling the Olympics due to CoronaVirus. That has some impact (not fatal) on the economy.  CV fucks old people more than young. So take that how you will

* Besides the two incidents of bad news near the time of the ex-dividend date the stock has consistently increased in the 3 weeks leading up to it's ex-dividend date.
* The next ex-dividend date is coming up on 3/24/20 which is in about 3 weeks.
* The dividend will be paying out 8% which is comforting to people looking to invest in safe stocks with high yield, especially in this current volatile market.

Direction: **Neutral** 

**Price Target:** **84$**

**Type: Call Credit Spread, Iron Condor**

**Fundamental:** Dollar tree has been a staple is the discount shopping segment, with its primary competition coming from Dollar General. DLTR has seen some recent declines due to weak forecasts and higher than anticipated expenses relating to the trade war. It has a very low PE with strong revenue. It’s currently projecting a -9% YoY EPS with lower revenue as well. DLTR has no dividend payout.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 35, oversold. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and very bullish open interest. Implied movement is 7.6% or about 6.25$ Short interest is at 1.9%, with 3.3 days to cover.

**Sentimental**: Dollar tree was heavily affected by the china trade war last year and the stocks suffered due to soft guidance and missing earnings. As of now the stock is current very undervalued, and there are plans to have store turnaround that focus on interior remodeling and modernizing. While the trade war impact is lessened, the disrupted supply chain may continue to affect Dollar Tree’s earnings, and given their previous mistake in underestimating a macro situation, I believe DLTR’s management will guide meekly, leading to a relatively flat price action.

Direction: **Neutral Bearish**

**Price Target:** **23$**

**Type: Call Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** Urban Outfitters has a great low PE and strong margins. Recently, it’s debt levels exploded and cash-on-hand are dwindling. This paints a mixed picture of a company trying to transition through growing expenses. While last quarter and Jan sales guidance were lackluster, some of its non-core brands are performing quite well in their respective niches. Outside of macro issues, a key focus will be Nuuly, its digital experience.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish neutral. RSI shows around 35, oversold. Options sentiments are very bearish in volume and very bearish open interest. Implied movement is 9.8% or about 2.30$ Short interest is at 8%, with 6.1 days to cover.

**Sentimental**: There are several macro headwinds that plague all of the retail sector, especially on their forward guidance. In addition, there may have been massive Adspend and development costs that will be factored into the earnings. Urban Outfitter’s incredible margin is a bright spot in this muddy analysis. In addition, we will be updated on the performance of Nuuly and see if there are incremental gains and updated progress towards a digital transformation. I think the main bull thesis is the “light in the darkness” potential. If URBN beats really hard and everything else is red, there is a chance that traders flock over. However, any negativity or weakness will be exposed and drive stock prices down.

The Korean government fast tracked remdisirvir and approved it for stage 3 clinical trial 4 days after Gilead applied for it (usually takes 30 days). Now remdisivir will be available at 3 major hospitals in Korea. Previously they've been applying symptomatic therapy for patients with mild symptoms and prescribing Kaletra (HIV drug) for those with more severe symptoms.

I don't personally have any positions in Gilead myself, but if stage 3 clinical trial results come in strong, it looks like Gilead make $$$.

I will link their entire report but one thing I wanted to highlight is this paragraph. Let me just note my opinion before I do. I've had many discussions with people who will say to me 'its just like the flu, who cares'. The problem isn't that this virus is deadly, the problem is how much treatment it requires when you contract it and how fast it is spreading. Right now we have a R0 factor of around 3 but we all know that is more likely around 4. We have 100k cases within just over a month and it's now hit North America. 

The problem isn't that this virus is severely deadly. The problem is the high percentage(20% of patients) of patients who NEED hospital care for WEEKS. Hospitals are equipped to give care for roughly 1% of the total population, and for the majority of cities those beds are almost at 100% occupancy year round. 

Let me repeat that one more time. Out of all patients in China who contracted this virus, **20% of patients needed hospital care for WEEKS. **

If hospitals can only accommodate 1% of the population at a given time and 20% of patients require hospital treatment, well you do the math.

I'm done listening to people talk about how it's just like the flu and not to be worried. People should be worried. Period.

Quote from WHO with link to article

* 

**>Healthcare system: 20% of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases**. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response, the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago.

So the CDC just announced TODAY that they're loosening the criteria for patients to be eligible to get a COVID-19 test. Up until now, the only time that patients were even tested for the virus is if they're in a HOSPITAL with a FEVER.. that means you could be walking into the doctor with a cough, runny nose, and sore throat, and they wouldn't even bust out the test kits. Let that sink in. This explains why the death rate for corona cases in USA is way higher than the average for other developed countries (\~7% vs \~2%). the US was only testing severe cases, which supports the story a supposed patient posted in the /r/coronavirus sub a few days ago, claiming they were sent home untested despite showing symptoms.

The US saw the first community transmission case a WEEK ago - since then we've had potentially contagious people being sent home untested. The old testing criteria probably damaged containment efforts, and the new testing criteria is going to cause an enormous spike in reported cases, guaranteed. We all saw how markets reacted when Italy reported a sudden spike in cases on Feb 22.. 

Still not convinced this is a problem? This virus is more contagious, and more deadly than seasonal flu's. Here's how the COVID-19 outbreak compares to similar epidemics in recent history. SARS, 2003 and MERS, 2012, the biologically most closely related viruses were not nearly as contagious and had almost no cases in the USA. We saw no disruption in daily lives. Now consider the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009. Over 43,000 confirmed cases and over 1,200 deaths in the USA. Much more contagious/widespread than SARS/MERS with a similar death rate. Yet none of the above viruses had any negative impact on the markets. Basically, the flu is also less contagious than COVID-19. The average person with flu infects 1.3 other people, while beer virus infects 2.2. This is because a lot of people already have a naturally built up immunity to a lot of strains of the flu, while no one is immune to corona. 

Combine this with the fact that there is no vaccine in sight for the next year, you're gonna see some shit. During a calm year, the flu has some 10 million cases in the USA. If corona reaches even this level, we'll see deaths in the six figures. Hence the (failing) scramble to contain. Some people are speculating that the virus will go away with warmer weather, but both SARS and MERS flourished in the summer months, so good luck. 

And unlike the first death over the weekend, or the rate cut, a sudden spike in cases is not priced in. People were expecting a red Monday just because someone died over the weekend? The US had more than 60 cases at that point. With a death rate of some 2.5%, a death was highly probably. After today's rally the S&P 500 is less than 9% below its all-time-high. Plus, if technicals are any indication, this back and fourth volatility is all the more reason to suspect we haven't hit the bottom.

TLDR; Hope you're using these green days to buy cheap puts. Give it a few weeks before panic sets in.

But we might not get that high which mean biting the bullet at 1.90-2.00.

Keep an eye on LK as it spikes. Earnings is coming up on Mar 11th. We will go with 20th because the 11th is not announced and firm. The last earnings report was up to Sept 30th. Thus Q4 coming up will report on Oct-Dec. They will have a loss per the norm. But just imagine guidance for Q1 (Jan through Mar)! It will be a disaster. Even today stores are not back to normal. Restaurants are closed. Take out is the norm for what is open. The news around LK has been very quiet the last 2 weeks giving fomo a chance to form. SBUX said things are getting back to normal which helped the fomo.

We have a short report:  [https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1223274746017722371](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1223274746017722371) Now I do not know how accurate it is but it never helps even if only bits and pieces are true. Some sketchy crap in there from many different angles.

Short interest sits at 46.4% as of 2/15. Quite often short sellers do a lot more research then longs. I don't need to mention the gone death flu is still causing some chaos. Raw coffee prices are spiking and sit above $1.20 a lb. Previously they could count on sub $1 pricing quite often during 2019.

The recent rise is probably traders wanting to cause a short squeeze before the big crash coming. Naturally they swill switch to shorting it once they are done. Because who in the duck is paying 40 plus right now?

I have no position at the moment but I am watching carefully for a slow rise up. I need a rise in SP price to offset some of that IV. Price target is below 35 after Mar 11th.  Looking for a 20% drop. I normally let option prices come to me to give me an edge.

Edit: Earnings date still unknown. mar 11th highly unlikely. 18th sketchy. 25th seems reasonable. FYI.",2020-03-04 23:16:59

Direction: **Mildly Bullish**

**Price Target:** **160$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread**

**Fundamental:** Splunk is a growth company simply for its 16 quarters of consecutive double digit growth. Splunk sports a very high, but not astronomical PE, with decent profitability and a consistent record of beating earnings guidance. The recent acquisition (6 month) of SignalFx gives them further footprint in the booming cloud computing sector. An additional note is an announcement of a DoD contract with some huge numbers on it. While I cannot explain its actual effects, I do believe this is a positive for Splunk. 

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50 day averages and below 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 48, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and bullish open interest. Implied movement is 9.1% or about 13.85$ Short interest is at 4.6%, with 5.6 days to cover. One thing to note, the ATM straddle is actually getting cheaper, with a tiny IV contraction. While not a strong signal, I believe this is bullish for Splunk, as contracting IV is not a normality in current macro environments. The skew to call side reinforces this idea. 

**Sentimental**: Splunk has been beating and raising for more than 4 years. This track record of growth and performance weights positively. Analyst sentiments are bullish with a higher price target than SPLK’s current price. Numerous partnerships with kings like AWS, CISCO, Accenture give Splunk a competitive moat. While not directly affected by the coronavirus, Splunk will need a massive win to command a big upward move. The main wildcard is the DoD deal updates, which can be a massive boost. Primary bear case is missing estimates and guiding lower.

6. If statistics are anything to go by, the U.S. is/has approached their 50 cases. It will soon explode. Note that these are statistics from countries that have actually ""tried"" to mitigate the spreading, the U.S. is putting an absolute abysmal amount of effort towards the beer virus. I imagine it'll get a lot worse pretty quickly.

8. India is no longer shipping meds out in fear of a global shortage. Let me repeat that. India, one of the world's largest exporter of meds, is done exporting meds because **they fear there will be a global shortage.**

10. Napkin math: U.S. death rate from the flu is .1%. Let's say (ignoring the fact that the coronavirus is much more quicker to spread) the infected numbers are the same. 34,000 deaths from the flu, on average, would mean 34,000,000 infected at a .1% death rate. 34,000,000 infected with the coronavirus would mean about 1 million deaths.

It’s simply a matter of time before someone in power, or someone in the public eye, catches this boomer eliminator and the media freaks out. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr fed can't hold the economy up on these paper stilts for long.

This is only brief DD. The virus hasn't been portrayed accurately in the media for fear of spreading panic, but once it starts raking the country, specifically retirement homes, people will begin to notice it's nothing to scoff at.

-Nikola was founded in 2014.  As stated on CNBC, they have a moat around their company now because they are the only ones who have working hydrogen fuel technology.
  
-The are building the world's only hydrogen infrastructure and it was stated that all other hydrogen-powered vehicles will use their infrastructure, as well - it wont be just for Nikola.
  
-Elon Musk says hydrogen vehicles is impossible.  Personally, I think he's worried about losing market share and afraid of the competition it can create, especially since Elon is looking into semi trucks himself.
  
-Nikola deal was backed by Fidelity Investments with $500M+ invested by them.
  
-Nikola confirmed Anhueser Bush made an $800M reservation in their move to make a more sustainable play for the company.
  
-Total of $4B in pre-orders.

Usually there is a big event, a massive market fall out, and then volatility while the market tries to figure out the new equilibrium. Sometimes there is an actual economic downturn that can lead to a recession.  

So usually, long options in a high VIX environment is a sucker’s game because you lose that sweet premium even if you pick the right direction. And sure, there are some bumpy times along the road as companies announce how they are affected by the big event. 

But past VIX spikes have followed single, relatively contained events. Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy happened at one point in time. The market fall out lasted a long time, but all of the following events could theoretically be predicted by a smart enough person. 

This is different. We have no idea whether coronavirus will be a minor hassle that resolves itself in the next few weeks, or an ongoing nightmare that just picks up momentum. Every day we get a new clue - more cases, less cases, trials, deaths, more countries, etc. The potential economic impact is constantly evolving and we don’t know how long that will last. 

I don’t think we can use past charts to predict what happens here. Nobody knows. But I don’t think long options are a bad play right now, despite their cost. I actually think that’s where the real money is. Get the options and wait for the fireworks. Or, if you’re in calls, the lack thereof.

Firstly, I always believe that when a government tries to cover up something, it usually mean the situation is way worse than we can imagine. If it is only a little horrible, the government can say, “It is very bad but we can still fix it, that’s why we are telling you the truth.”. But if the government tries to cover up, it usually means the truth is beyond horrible and there is no way for them to be transparent about it. And that is usually when I am really worried.

Here are some facts from the more transparent countries. For those who don’t know, the following charts (credits to Braydo25) shows exponential growth in the number of infected people. For people who don’t understand the power of exponential growth, if you have a dollar on the first day, and it doubles each day, you would have more money than the entire world combined in less than 2 months.

And this is the number of critical patients whom will need ventilators to help them breath when the virus took over their lungs. Combine this with the exponential growth of the infected, one can’t help but come to the conclusion that the healthcare system is going to be overwhelmed by the number of patients coming in.

If it is growing exponentially, then why is China and Iran telling the entire world that everything is good and dandy? And this is the part where government cover up is in play. Do you remember the few whistleblowers of the coronavirus situation? 2 of the doctors are dead and 2 of the journalists whistleblowers had been arrested and never heard from again.

Iran is another country trying to play down the numbers. If one is willing to look for it, there are videos of mass graves being dig in Iran right now (Source: https://en.radiofarda.com/a/lawmaker-in-iran-dismisses-official-coronavirus-death-toll/30460224.html ). In fact, 8% of Iran's parliament has tested positive for coronavirus. Source: https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/h_13306122baecfcaa123a7ca59478d0d6

What is the percentage of parliament people to the total population of Iran? That may give you a clue as to the actual cases in the country so if you see Iran only reporting 2000 cases in a country of 81 million people, take it with a grain of salt. If Iran only reported 20 people dying from the coronavirus but they are digging mass graves for the bodies, then it is really suspicious
.
Like I said, if the government is trying to cover up, it simply means the truth is beyond your imagination and they are not able to be transparent about it.

TLDR: The world is not only going into a recession, but the healthcare system may be overwhelmed during this epidemic. Governments are trying to coverup because the situation is so much worse than you can imagine. SPY Puts all the way until it drops another 15% in the coming few months.",2020-03-04 10:32:57

Simple:

- high debt, more vulnerable to supply shock, higher risk of going belly up in the next few months
- $QQQ likely will rally harder because of tech, which will hurt when holding the inverse

Live Nation own's a ton of venues. The company's income is directly from the entertainment industry. The unfortunate part for them? It's GIANT venues, in the most crowded places in the U.S. Public safety and police involvement in not optional. It's regulated by law and controlled by state/government. 

There's going to be a ton of cancellations, like really soon, reallly soon. Spring Break happens from the 14th-27th of march, (hint the no earlier than expiration for max gains). Huge groups are announcing cancellations ahead of time. (I've seen it in my own industry, you've seen it in the news.). LIVE NATION DOESN'T HAVE A MASS AMOUNT OF EVENTS SOON BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT. 

Spring Break cancellations will SHOOT this issue up. We've gone from the steps of international troubles, to supply chain yata yata yata. What's been massively missed? Internal entertainment and mass crowds. The entertainment industry has a massive red dildo about to be shot up (down?) its ass. Also, people are going to be holding onto their money (see 2008). The spending on entertainment is directly related to the economy, we're going down folks. 

The government is closely working with these groups (CDC) and trying to suppress as much public panic as long as possible. They're trying to minimize damage. They want to stall as long as possible. It's really bad. I've personally seen a TON of events cancelled.

Forgot to put strike/date at the top: I'm in September BAC $18 puts. Banks will start failing later this year. It's hard to tell which ones will fail, due to the *shadowy* nature of the *shadow lending* market. That, and the dollar will moon. You want positions spoonfed to you? Fuck off. This post is half food for thought, half explanation. Trying to follow the money here is *hard.* If you're lazy, just buy puts on indices like $INDA and $EWG and $EWY: any country that's loaded up on eurodollars.

&#x200B;

Alright, you tards, listen up: this is going to be a long, confusing post.

&#x200B;

First off, I'd like to say that I'm not smart. But that doesn't concern me, because you're not smart, either. I just began reading about repo operations a few days ago. I've seen a few posts on here lately remarking on the repo ops, and a lot of misconceptions about what they *are* and what they're intended to *do*. I've learned all of what I'm going to post here from other users on here and from my own research.

&#x200B;

The most important thing you need to understand about the repo market is that it's a black box. It's an **interbank loan market** **where securities (ideally bonds) are put up as collateral for short-term cash loans**. The transactions are private and the market usually sets the rates. Repurchase agreements are semantically different from fed repos, but **operate in the exact same way.** This is important. Banks, per federal legislation, are required to keep a minimum amount of cash on hand to prevent liquidity issues. The repo market exists as a way to circumvent these requirements; banks run as close to the reserve requirements as possible to maximize their profitability, and sometimes run below the limit. In this case, the bank posts collateral on the repo market in exchange for liquid cash to meet the requirements again.

&#x200B;

In September of last year, the fed was forced to offer hundreds of billions of dollars in repo agreements to banks. This is because the interbank repo interest rate had reached 10% due to liquidity problems. I'm still not sure, and I'm not sure that anyone else is sure, why the liquidity shortage arose, but it did. If I were to hazard a guess, it's because big domestic lenders, sensing volatility abroad, started to pull out of the repo market. Since then, the fed has been, on-and-off, offering repo agreements to large banks (designated banks are called Primary Dealer Banks \[PDBs\]) and they hold a special status and maintain accounts with the fed. Once these PDBs post collateral (again, securities), money (kind of) is transferred temporarily to their fed account. These PDBs then distribute the cash in the interbank repo market (which is anonymous) at a slight profit. The fed repo interest rate was around 1.6%; on Tuesday night, it jumped up to 1.8% because of the emergency demand.

&#x200B;

The fed had planned to cut repo ops to 0 by April of this year, essentially weaning the US banking system off of liquidity infusions. This didn't happen. Due to supply chain disruptions and market volatility, the fed was forced to offer several hundred billion in overnight repo agreements this week to PDBs in an effort to maintain liquidity. In fact, this month is set to hit record repo lending balances. Furthermore, the [fed is expecting another $130b](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/repo-reverse-repo-agreements/repurchase-agreement-operational-details#monthly-summary) to be repaid in the next three weeks, sucking even more liquidity out of the market.

Edit: The fed was also pondering establishing a standing clearing house for fed repos to smaller entities like hedge funds. Hopefully, they're walking that idea back, because it's a fucking *terrible* one.

&#x200B;

Now, here's where I learned I was wrong, and this is a point of confusion for some: **the banks don't need the liquidity for themselves.** They need the liquidity for their *borrowers*. See, these PDBs float money anonymously in the repo market to lots and lots of entities, both domestic and foreign. This is *shadow banking*. Remember when I said the repo market is a black box? Right, well, American banks have been lending money to foreign banks that don't have as stringent of regulations as American ones do. In the US, between two US banks, when a loan is written, some percentage of the loan size must be physically transferred over to the borrower (the reserve amount). Between an American bank and a foreign bank, though, no such requirement exists.

&#x200B;

From this discrepancy in regulation, the eurodollar is born. **The eurodollar is imaginary money** that is printed by American banks: when they make a loan to a foreign bank, the loan exists only on the balance sheets. There is no physical manifestation of currency transfer. Consequently, eurodollars get *leveraged to shit*. Instead of the fractional reserve system, the ideal interbank loan system in America, eurodollars can get loaned indefinitely, forever. Eurodollars are paying factory workers, building bridges, and trading as currency. But it's *not* currency. And because eurodollars are what circulate outside the US, real USD are becoming increasingly rare.

&#x200B;

You see, the USD has become the de facto global currency. There's a lot of confidence in it. It backs virtually every exchange of goods or services in the world. Right now, though, emerging markets' banks aren't really using it; they're hoarding it. Additionally, they're accepting *awful* collateral in exchange for eurodollars, because they know the USD has intrinsic value and eurodollars are imaginary. Collateral like subprime loans. Sound familiar? It should, because the 08 crisis was global *because of the international monetary system*. The mortgage defaults here at home were just the impetus - just like the supply chain disruptions this year might be. The subprime mortgage scandal was just the scapegoat for the **underlying fragility of the eurodollar system.**

&#x200B;

Now, PDBs are aware of this. That's one reason they're starting to become stingier with their lending. They know that their borrowers are accepting garbage collateral in exchange for eurodollars. They know that foreign banks are leveraging themselves up to the tits on *low-grade collateral,* which means, in essence, the fed is, by proxy, making out hundreds of billions in loans to banks in places like India for fucking used car loans instead of treasury bonds. So, say that Shyam over in India can't make his car payments this month because he hasn't worked since the quarantine began. And his neighbors all do the same. Without US liquidity injections, channeled through the PDBs and into the shady repo market, that Indian bank will fail.

&#x200B;

Now, that's why it matters that US lenders are pulling out of foreign markets: with supply/manufacturing disruptions and increasing volatility all over the world, foreign banks are direly hurting for liquidity so they can make out loans for businesses and manufacturers and individuals and all sorts of entities. If they don't get this liquidity, they're likely to default. And what happens when these capital groups and small banks die? They default on *their* loans. So on, up the chain. Say JPM takes out $50b against its treasuries from the fed. It then sells that money on the repo market. Eventually, that money finds its way to Yong Jiang over in China, who took out a loan to keep the lights on in the McDonald's Toy factory in Hubei. Well, three months later, sales haven't made up for lost revenue during the quarantine, and Yong Jiang becomes insolvent and defaults on his loan. That default makes its way back up the ladder to JPM. Now, JPM can either default on its loan from the fed (and bonds get dumped on the market) or it can liquidate some of its assets to pay the fed back.

&#x200B;

JPM has made this calculation and decided, fuck no, it wants none of that. The problem is, though, that the loan has already been taken out by Yong Jiang. Say Yong Jiang's bank needs some liquidity because Yong defaults. Well, JPM has stopped taking fed repos because of the risk, so there's no money to buy on the market, and Yong's bank fails. This happens dozens of times, across dozens of countries. Pretty soon, the international banking industry faces systemic collapse. For reference, the global repo market [is valued at $12T](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=2ahUKEwjqgof02IToAhXwm-AKHY3rA8gQFjACegQICxAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bis.org%2Fpubl%2Fcgfs59.pdf&usg=AOvVaw21Jay8zD6uNqWJcspNvCXa) USD, and only 3/4 of it is backed by ""pristine collateral"" - government bonds. **That means that $3T of it is in equities or derivatives.** The fed's balance sheet is only *$4T* USD in comparison. Additionally, $.5T is in private capital groups, which are entirely opaque and likely have rotten fucking lending standards. No way to see who they're lending to, or what collateral they're taking.

&#x200B;

We're already seeing this beginning: [India's Yes Bank is about to be nationalized](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/india-s-central-bank-to-seize-yes-bank-to-help-revive-lender) due to, you guessed it, *liquidity* problems. It's been involved in shadow lending practices, and American liquidity is starting to dry up across the world. China is also heavily dependent on eurodollars, but I'm not sure how that relationship will shake out. Their economy might be so big and so vital that we're forced to prop them up. If not, China's banking system will go tits up, too.

&#x200B;

The question then becomes, is the fed willing and able to meet global liquidity demands? And beyond this, how do they force PDBs to keep printing eurodollars and continue to assume risk, risk which may violate their fiduciary obligation to shareholders? Trillion-dollar question.

&#x200B;

So, what does all this mean? Who can we short? Honestly, this is hard to say. Personally, I have september puts on BAC for $18, and I'm still looking for anyone else who might be vulnerable. Any of the PDBs with accounts at the fed might be at risk. I'm going to start hunting for SE Asian, African, and South American banks that've been taking repo money. Those are likely to be the most probable to fail. On top of that, as banks start dropping like flies and the global economy tanks, the USD is going to fucking \*moon\*. That's a worthwhile bet, too. The issue here is that the repo market is anonymous, so it's hard to follow the money. If anyone has any recommendations for specific banks or lending groups to target or look into more, please feel free to let me know.

&#x200B;

If the global banking industry started to fail, though, look for it to hit full swing later this year. This is going to be driven by large amounts of defaults that will be spurred by the manufacturing disruptions, the extent of which won't be fully felt until at least midway through this year. Add a few months for missed loan payments, and I'm wagering that you'll see banks start *really* failing by August or September.

&#x200B;

There's a lot here I'm going to continue to research, and if there's anything I've gotten wrong or anything you'd like to add, please speak up and correct me/educate me.

“Stocks resumed declines in Asia as optimism about fiscal packages round the world to address the blow from the coronavirus evaporated. Bond yields tested fresh all-time lows at the end of another turbulent week for global markets.

“All we know now is that we don’t really understand what’s going to happen next,” Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management LLC, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s probably four, six, eight weeks before we’re going to have any useful information as to what the trajectory of the virus is and what the actual economic fallout looks like.”

To explain to those who are truly retarded (and not just high functional autistic like the rest of us), how expensive puts are can be measured by their implied volatilty, and IV for most stonks have been going through the fucking roof. For everyone's recent favorite whipping boys CCL and AAL, it's gone from 30s to about 110.

But, IV crush can be a double ended dildo, so instead of being pegged by holding puts when IV decreases, why not peg the IV back? If you're pretty sure stonks will go down but IV is high, you can *sell calls.* Currently, my favorite whipping boy AAL has 3/20 20 on sale for .33 cents, which means they'd need to go to 20.33 from 16.04 to be not profitable. I mean, AAL *could* moon over 27% in the next 2 weeks, but I doubt it.

Granted, selling calls doesn't have the same 420+% porn of some put buys, but it seems like a good directional bet now that also takes into consideration high IV costs. So what about it? Who's down to get freaky with some double 🌈🐻 action with me, bear on a stock and on IV?

DD,Don't Miss The Boat on Gold,99,fe1lpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe1lpb/dont_miss_the_boat_on_gold/,53,1583469319.0,"**Situation**

Currently, when investors are choosing between a corporation (a massive group of people with resources, real estate, plans, and intellectual property united for an endeavor) or a shiny rock, they are picking the shiny rock. I recommend that you also pick the shiny rock, there are a few reasons for that.

The first is that gold has been on the way up since before the coronavirus was even a thing. This is not part of a short term trend. A part of the reason behind its rise in value is the negative interest rate environment of much of the world, and the anticipated results of fiscal stimulus. 

Another part is that gold production is peaking. There is not a whole lot of gold discovery going on, at least, of gold that is accessible and high grade. A recent find in India, for example, was alleged to be 3000 tons. That number has since declined to 150 tons that might be extractable. 

Meanwhile demand remains strong and increasing, in part, this is driven by the increase in the global population of the middle class across Asia, but it is also driven by demand from sovereign states and banks. This is putting price pressure on the material and increasing the value of the businesses that extract it.

While some might note the wild swing in gold prices last week, it's important to understand why gold fluctuated. It is because in order to meet margin calls, traders had to sell something. They sold gold because it retained more value than their other assets-- selling gold is much better than realizing millions of dollars of losses on other securities.

As a recession starts to look like a reality, we can expect gold to continue to rise. While yes, it is spiking now, last time a recession happened gold continued to rally until it doubled in value, all while the S&P declined and eventually returned to flat.

The best part about buying gold is that the ideal time to sell it also aligns really well with the ideal time to get back into equities. Even if you intend to keep a huge equity position, storing some gold along the sidelines and cashing it in when you want to buy is a good way to mitigate risk.

**Ways to Play**

There are a lot of different ways to get in on the rise in gold prices. The first is simply buying GLD stock. Or, for those who really thirst for tendies, buying GLD calls. If you do want to buy calls, please look at the scheduled federal reserve meetings. The closest ones are as follows:

March 17-18

April 28-29

June 9-10

July 28-29

Strike dates two weeks out from the meetings might be best if you want to be less risky and give yourself time to recover if the Fed does not act as expected.

If you want to buy shares of the ETFs (GLD, IAU) it looks like the middle of the week, after 2:30pm ET, is a good sweet spot for getting a good price. GLD is nice because it is super liquid. IAU is nice because you can be more precise in the amounts you want to trade. You can just wait for a dip as well, like anything else. 

Be careful on buying before weekends. The price usually spikes on Monday, that can be great, or it can be very not great.

The other way to get in on the action is through companies that mine gold. While there are sector ETFs, I think that it might be better to pick individual companies. There is one that Cramer shills, he covered it sometime recently.  It is pretty good, but there are others.

The reason to avoid just getting all gold miners, is that this is a capital intensive business. A lot of mining companies are in debt and might not have access to the credit they need to continue operations. When/if that happens, they sink like a rock. So, perhaps create your own basket of securities rather than buying in on the premade ones.

Lastly, some people might want to buy physical gold. I do not recommend this just because the fees you would pay at spot price wash out your gains. Also, storing and securing gold can be a challenge. If you are going this route, I recommend getting 1 oz Kruggerands. Rather than buying them online, try to find a gold dealer near you that is highly reviewed on online platforms. You should not pay more than $5-10 above the spot price of gold for that day.

**Resources to Learn More**

Honestly, it is hard to get very good analysis of gold from the sites that sell it. They have a pretty obvious agenda and say crazy stuff like Gold to $2000?! just to generate hype and sales. 

Instead, I recommend going through any sort of general market analysis or newsletter. These are often put out by large financial institutions. They will almost always mention gold and it is worth looking at what they have to say.

tl;dr There is still opportunity, wait for a good time to buy and then buy, call strategy should align with expected moving dates.",2020-03-05 23:35:19

Direction: **Neutral Bearish**

**Price Target:** **125$**

**Type: Call Credit spread, Iron Condor**

**Fundamental:** OKTA has been a cloud darling since 2017, with the stock exploding in 2018. Currently, OKTA is not profitable. OKTA has beat earnings 100% of the time for the past 2 years. However, the earnings performance was not always positive. This means that outside of beating earnings, OKTA must navigate both profit-collection and lackluster guidance. Okta currently does not pay a dividend. One risk factor is OKTA’s D/E Ratio, which is 230+. This is incredibly high and poses a risk for long term OKTA holders. 

**Technical**: Price at the 50D moving average, below the 20 day MA and above the 200DMA.  MACD shows bullish divergence. RSI shows around 50. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and bearish open interest. Implied movement is 7.4% or about 9.56$ Short interest is at 6.6%, with 6.9 days to cover. 

**Sentimental**: Being an unprofitable tech growth company is current macro conditions is very risky. Extrapolating SPLK’s earnings, we can say that the market expectations for profitable company was already very high. OKTA must continue its streak while proving that they can hit profitability. Any mistakes will be heavily punished. Currently, its EPS and Revenue revisions have been very bullish, in addition to a recent price correction from the 140’s. While I believe OKTA will beat earnings, the guidance will not be bullish enough for the stock to pop.

**Price Target:** **320$**

**Fundamental:** Costco is one of the most respected and trusted consumer retail companies in the world. From sales transparency to its customer-focused business model, everything about Costco screams wholesome goodness. The market has rewarded this rare type of business with a monster 36 PE. (TGT - 17.5, WMT 22.23, BBY 13.8) This is really really expensive for a retail sector company. Costco pays a dividend of 2.60$. It has a relatively high institutional ownership of 70%.

**Technical**: Priced above 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bearish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement is 4.8% or about 15.26$ Short interest is at 1.1%, with 2.1 days to cover. Support at 306$, with all time high being 325.26$

**Sentimental**: Costco suffered a steep selloff like the rest of the market. However, it has recovered 75% of the drop this week. One macro sentiment fueling Costco is the stockpile phenomenon. With coronavirus breaking out, many are going to Costco and purchasing out sized bulk goods in preparation. This should lead to an uptick in sales that will help Costco beat Revenue estimates. EPS may be affected due to sickness and preventive measures. Guidance might be affected as well, though I believe that has already been priced in. The main bearish move would be a lackluster guidance or missing EPS.

Also, the U.S. was in it's first year into being off the QE tiddy milk.  If we look at the relatively flat returns of bingeing Fed teddies since that start of 2015 through the diarrhea at the end of August 2015 (Fig 2.), we can relate a same like-ness to whats transpired over the last 10 days.  The difference is that we've had a huge run up last year with an even greater dependency on Chinese growth than in 2015.

Let's just go through the implications behind the flying AIDS that we call the beer virus.

&#x200B;

1. The 10Y treasury bond yield is literally at astronomically low levels. What does this imply? The people are fleeing from conventional ""safe-havens"" in search of something even more safe. Smart money is aware of how badly this shit storm is about to get. The yields are a direct representation of consumer confidence plummeting.
   1. [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx)
2. Recovered patients have been fucking dying due to the permanent damage that is being caused by the virus itself. No explaining here. Population will take a hit.
   1. [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3065091/coronavirus-recovered-patient-dies-china-reports-139-new-cases](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3065091/coronavirus-recovered-patient-dies-china-reports-139-new-cases)
3. I want to reiterate this point: **the U.S. is putting zero effort towards this cause. The U.S. will literally not even come** **close to their goal of X amount of masks by weeks end. Nowhere near close enough.**
   1. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/u-s-won-t-meet-coronavirus-test-rollout-goal-senators-say?utm\_content=business&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=twitter&utm\_campaign=socialflow-organic](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/u-s-won-t-meet-coronavirus-test-rollout-goal-senators-say?utm_content=business&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic)
4. The U.S. is literally just about a week into public testing and case deaths, and we've already had a **50 basis point rate cut** and banks are **already in search of bailout money.** What does this mean? It's fucking bad. The fed injections and repo will have to come back around soon (specifically repo funding), and some of it will even have to be paid back next week.

5. The unprecedented fucking double-sided supply shortage is unprecedented. There are supply shortages and labor shortages on every fucking end of the globe, and this will cause massive amounts of supply chain problems in the foreseeable future. On top of that, drug shortages (India is done shipping) will be a monumental issue.

6. The amount of events being cancelled every day is unprecedented. Not only will these cancellations hinder advancement in certain fields, the entertainment cancellations will ensure public panic soon enough.
   1. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/05/coronavirus-update-list-canceled-events/4950641002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/05/coronavirus-update-list-canceled-events/4950641002/)
7. The primary issue won't be the deaths racking up from the Coronavirus (although that will be an extreme issue), it is the fact that hospitals are not equipped for the ensuing storm. People will be body-bagged (check Iran) and sitting in hospital hallways. Hospitals will become a petri dish. The sick around sick will cause immense issues. Imagine you ""recover"" in a hospital, you are surrounded by people carrying potential mutations and variations, and your immune system and lungs are already weakened. You're fucked.

8. The U.S. is racking up horrific death statistics. This could be caused by the lack of actionable effort by the government, the quick community spread, the lack of testing, or all of the above and more.

9. This virus is bringing the U.S. inequality crisis to light. People are literally scared of not going to work because they won't get paid. Companies are sending people home with unpaid leave. So many families are living paycheck-to-paycheck. This will fuck the U.S. labor force while simultaneously getting everybody sick AND increasing the evident future homelessness rates as people can't afford it.

And I’m starting to feel really shitty. 

Let me explain. 

We’re all having a good time “making tendies”. It’s ain’t that fucking hard... short any flagship equity within a sector that’s directly impacted by the beer virus. All of you ass clowns let emotions get in the way of a good short and hold, and the ones that don’t crush the gainz. 

That said, here’s the sad, and uneasy reality, that’s starting to set in... This virus isn’t a game, and people are about to die. [A lot of people. ](https://twitter.com/sethbannon/status/1236125593290276864?s=21)

It’s all fun and games, until you realize your parents and grandparents are older than 60, and face the real prospect of critical illness. 

Maybe it’s something more innocuous, like [the NBA playing the rest of the season with no fans. ](https://twitter.com/shamscharania/status/1236122231656378373?s=21)

Either way, this is starting to feel like the prologue to a dystopian nightmare. In the span of tying this, I received four separate emails from various companies about “how they are dealing with COVID”, and an alert from my own healthcare provider on how I can order doctors on demand to lower my risk of exposure. 

So again.. making money right now isn’t hard. Before you “positions or ban” me, scroll up and click the link and stfu. Grow some balls, make a basket of put options that short indexes and equities from impacted sectors, then go long on inversely correlates equities (ie hospital care providers). The market will generally drift down, and flash crash in the coming days (assuming this isn’t too late and it all goes down Monday, given the fire hose of shifty news). 

But as your laughing all the way to the bank while watching the world burn, I encourage you to step back and take some stock in what’s actually happening here... because it’s really fucked up, and about to land on your doorstep. 

I wish you all you fellow WSB’ers the best of luck and health through these tough times.

* Their valuation cratered from 1.1B to less than 600M prior to their IPO.
* As of right now CSPR is trading at less than 10 dollars and a valuation of less than 400M
* Casper has never made a profit and has lost more than 300M dollars over the last 5-6 years.
   * Casper serves more countries than PRPL and PRPL is now growing faster.
* &#x200B;
* CSPR subs their manufacturing to another company.
* CSPR currently loses money on every mattress even though their gross margin is 50%+
* CSPR will likely not be profitable for 18+ months.
* CSPR has chosen to partner with target and open their own stores. Currently they have opened 60+ stores.

Purple is due to release earnings @ 4:30 Eastern on Monday, March 9th. The following items are DD that I have been doing over the course of the last 2 years.

* Purple has been vastly under the radar as it went public through a reverse merger. At the time of the merger PRPL had just completed their second full year of business and they had net sales of 188M.
* In purple's third year, they grew sales to 284M.
* In 2019 (PRPL's 4th year) the company has projected sales of \~400-425M. They report earnings on Monday.
* Prpl has drastically improved their wholesale business.
   * in 2018 Wholesale revenue was less than 25% of their sales.
   * in 2019, Wholesale revenue is approaching 45% of their business in the latest quarter.
   * At the end of 2019 purple was in approximately 1400 wholesale locations and had 5 mattress Max machines.
   * See S-3 filing date below. Average selling price for a mattress is almost 1800.00 dollars.

The CEO has recently made comments that in 2020, PRPL anticipates bringing on 4 more machines and improving operations to double capacity.

* These machines lead me to believe PRPL might provide guidance of 650-700M which would be 40%+ growth.
* PRPL's gross margin in Q3 was 45%
* PRPL just released a new Harmony pillow.
* PRPL has barely started penetrating the mattress market (Insert Mom joke here)
* there are \~30,000 furniture stores in the USA, PRPL is in less than 3% with ample room to grow.

Macy's. 

Probably you've heard this randomly put out there, I know I've said it for a few weeks. But lemme tell ya. While jc Penny's exists as a stock at the 75c range, Macy's could very well get close to this by late fall.

They are a mall based outlet that has failed over the past few years to online streamline thier products and keep up with the times, they rely on consumer facing and people mall shopping. They rely insanley on chinas manufacturing and tons of companies that they stock as well. They haven't gotten any better with it.  That's all about to go to shit completely soon. 

My mother is a huge online shopper and used to ship there big time in stores, she and all the people she knows are all about JCPenneys, Amazon and all that other middle age Becky shit, Macy's has fallen off. 

They are cutting 200 stores and 2500 jobs throughout. 

Fully understand they have good revenue past few qts and been around expectstions but the decline is constant. The that dividend they are putting out is absolutely retarted. If they don't cut it it's gonna pull back more and more and with the wubeersuperflu coming, the white mom's that do go to Macy's will be scared shitl.ess to go outside little lone a fucking mall.

Thank you to u/prayers4wuhan for posting a short DD on GIS. I bought some calls after I saw his DD and I am 50% up so far.

After reading his DD, I did some more research on GIS to see if the company actually has good potential to go up.

**SO, here is my DD :**

***ABOUT THE COMPANY***

It is a global leading food company that serves us the food that we love such as Cheerios, Haagen Daz ice-cream, Nature Valley, Annie's, Yoplait yoghurt, Betty Crocker, Pillbury, Yoki and many more. During 2019, they generated net sales of $16.9 billion. If you want to know more about the company then [CLICK HERE.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-mills-webcast-fiscal-2020-213000477.html)

&#x200B;

***PAST QUARTERLY EARNINGS***

They were able to beat all of their last 4 quarterly earnings.

**Q2 2020 :** Expected EPS was 88 cents and their reported EPS was 95 cents **(Beat 8.4%)**

Expected Revenue was 4.43B and their reported revenue was 4.42B **(Missed 0.16%)**

**Q1 2020 :** Expected EPS was 77 cents and their reported EPS was 79 cents **(Beat 2.58%)**

Expected Revenue was 4.08B and their reported revenue was 4.00B **(Missed 2.00%)**

**Q4 2019 :** Expected EPS was 76 cents and their reported EPS was 83 cents **(Beat 8.52%)**

Expected Revenue was 4.24B and their reported revenue was 4.16B **(Missed 1.74%)**

**Q3 2019 :** Expected EPS was 69 cents and their reported EPS was 83 cents **(Beat 20.39%)**

Expected Revenue was 4.21B and their reported revenue was 4.20B **(Missed 0.16%)**

&#x200B;

If you notice they always over performed their EPS. Expected EPS for this quarter is **77 cents** and it seems like they will probably beat that considering they mostly had an **EPS of 80 or more.**

&#x200B;

According to [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/consumer-defensive-stocks/?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo), General Mills (GIS) is the one of the best value consumer staple stock with a 12 month Trailing **P/E Ratio of 15.5** and a market cap of **$32.6B.**

**This stock is expected to go up especially once people start stocking up Cereals & Canned Foods.**

The stock is currently trading at **54.77.** The calls for **3/20** **60$c's** are **cheap** right now. **Expected earnings on 3/18 premarket.**

DD,DD: Theme park wait times and closures,95,femv9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/femv9x/dd_theme_park_wait_times_and_closures/,29,1583568512.0,"I live in LA but I spent the last 10 years living in Orlando and visited the theme parks probably one day a week on average; mostly WDW, but also Universal, and SeaWorld. I know that sounds like a lot, but they offer FL resident discounts on annual passes, and when you live there, you end up with a lot of friends in that sphere.

First off: They don’t reveal daily park attendance numbers, but you CAN download apps for any of these parks and see live wait times. The Disneyland (CA) app is different from the Disney World app (FL). In the SeaWorld app you can view all 3 locations (FL, TX, CA) in the same app. And finally, Universal Orlando and Hollywood are also separate apps.

Wait times are generally pretty consistent which makes them a good indicator of park populations. Newer rides are generally higher (Hagrid’s Motorbike ride is newer and ~100 minutes today), and weekends are busier. But if you see the big IP attractions like Avatar / Star Wars get down below 30 mins on a weekend, that should be a red flag. I was looking at SeaWorld and it looked pretty slow, but it’s also a Friday, so I’m checking tomorrow and Sunday.

Second: WDW rarely closes. Since 1971 they’ve closed less than 10 days or so, mostly due to hurricanes. If they take the same measures as the Disney parks in Asia and close for weeks, hopefully you’ve already bought puts.",2020-03-07 03:08:32

DD,Buy solar where the sun is still shining upon the market: SolarEdge (SEDG) DD,27,fem7gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fem7gy/buy_solar_where_the_sun_is_still_shining_upon_the/,25,1583565604.0,"In the face of significant market headwinds - I humbly submit for your consideration a bull case for SolarEdge (SEDG).

&#x200B;

For the last year, SEDG has continuously beaten market earnings expectations in spite of the now year and a half old [25% tariffs](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/472691-analysis-trump-solar-tariffs-cost-62k-us-jobs) that were placed on photovoltaics against China - which has significantly diverted production to other areas of the world and at the time was seen as a potential pitfall for investment in solar.

&#x200B;

Second, the company is for all reasonable purposes operating without any significant debt (D/E of 5.68) - which gives them a ton of wiggle room if we do enter a recession as a result of eurodollar/covid 19 problems. Additionally, it will insulate them from shock related to failing zombie companies who are leveraged to the tits.

&#x200B;

Third, the stock is uncoupled from the broader market (-.25 Beta) and is still trading near ATH - implying that smart money is still pouring in despite broader market fears.

&#x200B;

Fourth, in the last year SEDG has significantly expanded its foreign operations - [signing new deals](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solaredge-supply-enfindus-inverters-1gw-080000014.html) with European solar installers like Enfindus. As a result of this and its 33% earnings surprise in December its 2020 EPS expectations have been revised up 11 times in the last 30 days.

&#x200B;

Fifth, I believe that SEDG is in a stronger overall position than its primary market rivals [ENPH](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ENPH/analysis?p=ENPH) and [RUN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RUN/key-statistics?p=RUN) in large part due to its larger market share and lower total debt than either, giving it more potential leverage for growth than either moving forward. (Actuallly, interestingly, a very strong bear case can be made for RUN as a result of its negative EPS and total debt being greater than its entire market capitalization).

&#x200B;

In conclusion, I believe that SEDG represents both a long term growth opportunity and a good short term hedge against market volatility. It will continue to perform better than its major peers for the foreseeable future - and I believe that the future demand for renewable energy will only continue to increase. For this reason, I believe that bulls looking for a play to ride out this market will find SEDG to be a really good addition to your portfolios.

&#x200B;

I have no strong convictions regarding call plays in the face of short term market headwinds - but I would strongly support LEAPS or actual investment into the company. In short, make tendies where the sun shines.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: SEDG good company, SEDG make many tendies, you buy SEDG for tendies",2020-03-07 02:20:04

I haven't seen much talk about Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) recently. A couple mentions in the comments, but no threads. It went up about 50% today (dipped a little at the end), and it's up about 300% from a week ago. This is all because it's entering human clinical trials in April. Well, so the fuck what.

We could talk science. But I'm an anti-vaxxer and a flat-earther. I say science is for nerds, so here's two key things to stuff into your Adderall-addled brains:

\- The success rate for clinical trials is 10-15% ([https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/02/a-new-look-at-clinical-success-rates](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/02/a-new-look-at-clinical-success-rates))

\- Clinical trials can take years (even though CEO Mr. Kim said things would be accelerated). If all goes perfectly, this vaccine will be ready by the end of the year. The beer virus could very well have mutated (see SARS) and/or not be a big deal at all at that point. 

I'm assuming most of you can't read, so here are some colorful charts that prove my hypothesis:

They just got their first two confirmed cases this week, have two more today, and for a country of more than 240 million who is one of China's largest trading partners, they have only tested 143 people; they won't even test the family members of those confirmed to have the virus.

1. they have a theocratic government which hates evidence-based approaches to healthcare and it's kind of comical. Their ""health minister"" keeps downplaying the importance of hygiene and other precautions for the virus because he literally believed that ""prayer, not masks"" had kept Indonesia from detecting the virus prior to this week. Now, we know it's there, and people are returning from Indonesia with beer virus with no idea how they got it: the total is 7 people so far that have caught it after leaving Indonesia. Now, with the 4 confirmed cases, the tourist they say brought it to these two people was free in the country for long enough to spread it, and one of the women who initially caught it went 2 weeks symptomatic before finally going to the hospital. More cases will come out soon, it's just a matter of them not wanting to test because they're in religious denial. 2 days ago [their health minister reiterated that](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-coronavirus-covid-19-patient-two-weeks-before-tested-12491484?cid=h3_referral_inarticlelinks_24082018_cna) ""The most important thing to do is to pray. If we are paranoid our immunity will go down"".

2. They're pumping stimulus into their economy; another $700 million was announced Monday. Tourism is a major industry of theirs, though, and no amount of stimulus will make people fly into Indonesia to catch coronavirus. They can't put stimulus into that industry as cases go up because travel will have to shut down, meaning that industry will remain in freefall. [They've already stopped putting money into tourism. ](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/03/03/government-delays-incentives-for-foreign-tourists-after-covid-19-hits-indonesia.html) 13% of all tourism in the country was by Chinese nationals, so that is also out the window.

3. They have the fourth highest population of any country in the world and aren't equipped to handle the virus when they realize it's out of control; they only have one lab in the country equipped to handle samples and so far [they've only tested 143 samples.](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/how-come-indonesia-has-no-covid-19-cases-jakarta-post) For perspective on how little of a shit they give, their neighbor Malaysia has tested thousands of people already and only has an 8th of the population that Indonesia does.

4. They're one of China's larger trading partners. [30% of all of their imports come from China, comprising over $44.5 billion dollars in 2019.](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/02/04/jokowi-asks-aides-to-assess-coronavirus-impact-on-economy-indonesia-china-trade.html) This means they have high exposure as supply chain disruptions continue in China.

5. They're desperate to avoid the economic consequences of coronavirus which gives them an incentive to push it under the rug - for years they have been viewed by international investors as a raw materials exporter only, and are trying to get into manufacturing, and so they're pushing back at all costs against low investor confidence. They even have banned shortselling in their own markets, allegedly because they fear the ethical consequences of ""profiting off of suffering"".

Edit: ETF ticker for Indonesia is EIDO, strikes can be $19 on 3/20 or 4/20 

http://imgur.com/gallery/544TXHx is what I have so far. I bought $24 strikes while the stock was at $25, now it's down to ~$21.50, I'm an fast food working econ student with 1k or I'd be more invested

As it already is, these cruise ships are half full and people are canceling so it isn't unreasonable to believe that the people thinking ""oh its a great sale"" are going to stop thinking that once the actual government makes an official statement telling Americans to skip cruises and only do essential traveling for a few months to prevent beer virus spread. You could argue that the drop today in cruise stocks was the impact, but no way.. now that people will be told to stop going on them, they will listen and it should drop like 6-10% since the last of men going on cruises are now being taken away from cruise companies.

I bought CCL 26.5p 3/13s this morning. Seems like the fed Is trying really hard to keep these guys alive but clearly airline companies are more important so they are the ones who really have the fed's backs.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - the hopeful people who think cruises are 'on sale' right now are about to take some horse shit to their faces once they realize the government is going to discourage cruises. impact not fully realized yet. buy puts.

&#x200B;

EDIT: people are saying IV is so high... so what? I bought CCL puts today not even at the peak and im up 20% on them. you'll make good money from the stock price drop. IV crush unlikely until coronavirus dies down ",2020-03-06 20:41:03

Boeing's 737 Max was “marred” by technical problems, a lack of transparency and other issues, according to preliminary findings of a House investigation into the beleaguered plane.

The planes have been grounded for nearly a year after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. Regulators have not said exactly when they expect to permit the jetliners to fly again but they are reviewing changes Boeing made to improve their safety.

The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure began probing how Boeing developed the planes and how regulators approved them three years ago. The crisis over the crashes, which had been Boeing’s bestseller, has cost the company billions, prompted it to suspend production and cost the former CEO his job.",2020-03-06 20:14:10
DD,DD on Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY),87,fefxrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fefxrq/dd_on_bristolmyers_squibb_bmy/,62,1583540975.0,"**Introduction**

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies - around since 1887. They have just recently went through an acquisition of Celgene (formerly CELG). More on this later.

I truly believe that this company has a lot of potential. Firstly, they were named a [Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Top Pick](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bristol-myers-is-named-a-top-pick-at-bank-of-america?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo) on March 5th and that kind of went under the radar due to the coronavirus news.

The same article explains that BMY has a buy rating and $75 price target. Shares are currently \~$60 each, and very much oversold due to panic.

Their current drug product offering includes 8 different medicines, and these combined sales in 2019 exceeded $36 billion – each and every product was in the green compared to 2018. Verify via their [Q4 earnings released February 6th](https://bristolmyers2016ir.q4web.com/iframes/events-and-presentations/event-details/2020/2019-Fourth-Quarter-Results-Conference-Call/default.aspx).

**Financial Statement Health:**

Their December 2019 balance sheet has them sitting on \~$15 million in cash, and $130 million in assets. Operating expenses is at \~$12 million, and gross profit is at \~$18 million.

Additionally, the company has *SIX* new products in the pipeline that is estimated to bump up revenue by $1.5 billion in 2021, and increase EPS from $6-$6.20 to $7.15-$7.45. They’re laying pipe and even announcing how much it will grow during their **research/development day on April 2nd**. I believe that the shares will explode following that day.

Most pharmaceutical companies trade around \~15 times their price/earnings multiple, and the new price target will only put them at a 12 multiple. **They are currently trading at only a 9 multiple.**

Back to the acquisition – in November BMY formerly acquired CELG. This was an interesting move because CELG is currently the market leader (first to market and most effective) in CAR T therapy. CAR T therapy operates by manipulating a patient’s own blood and then using that blood as therapy for treatment of myeloma cancer. This therapy product is called ide-cel, and in December 2019 [Bloomberg posted the positive results of their phase 2 study](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-12-06/bristol-myers-squibb-and-bluebird-bio-announce-positive-top-line-results-from-the-pivotal-phase-2-karmma-study-of-ide-cel-in). They are almost ready to submit final FDA submission to get ide-cel into a commercialized state, which would yield huge tendies.

Disclaimer: the acquisition caused BMY to take on Celgene’s debt, and this is reflected in their current debt of \~$51 million.

Now for the more exciting news – coronavirus. Come with me – this is kind of a longer leg. The drug thalidomide (sold as thalomid) was developed in the 1950s and originally served as a miracle drug for anxiety, sleeping, and morning sickness caused by pregnancy. Unfortunately it was determined that this drug caused about 10000 baby deaths. This drug actually is what spawned the generation of the FDA and all of the drug product regulations. Rights to the drug jumped hands several times since then, **but it was acquired by Celgene in 2006**. Through their research they introduced Lenalidomide (Revlimid) that is also used to treat multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. The amazing part is that **thalidomide has actually been linked to some treatments for the COVID-19 coronovirus flu**, as indicated [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/7Qi164UOPks9h2ekHsvJyQ) and [here](http://m.wzrbw.cmstop.cn/p/117954.html?from=singlemessage&isappinstalled=0) (translation below).

*Translation: Secretary of the Party Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University used thalidomide tablets to treat pneumonia brought on by coronavirus and the preliminary results showed effectiveness. Patients who took thalidomide daily showed a dramatic decrease in symptoms after 3-4 days, and full recovery and discharge after 14 days.*

With the [uncertainty that a vaccine may not be effective](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-reinfection.html) due to reinfections, a treatment other than vaccination is another important part of dealing with this world event in both the short and long term.

**The Play:**

I am currently betting on the R&D reports on April 2nd. I think realistically this can excite investors and balloon the share price to \~$65 by then, $75 if they announce anything related to the possible non-vaccination treatment of coronavirus utilizing thalidomide. Right now these calls on 4/3 and 4/9 are less than a buck – a complete steal IMO.

**Summary:**

This is an older company that is continuing to innovate treatments for high priority illness. They have extremely promising press, financial backings, and their financial statements look healthy. They are currently undervalued and oversold, and top investors already know this. The BMY drug product offering is already incredibly strong and has plenty of gas in the tank to laydown the pipeline in 2020 and 2021. They also hold the rights to Revlimid and Thalidomide which some doctors believe can drastically help treat the symptoms of the coronavirus.",2020-03-06 19:29:35

&#x200B;

With the economy seeming entering in to the next recession (or worse), we are all wondering where we can get our money in to become the guy from the Big Short.

&#x200B;

As noted in the TL;DR at the top for all the autists who can only read TSE, I believe the auto industry will be the next one to crash.

&#x200B;

Here is why:

US households are absolutely jacked with car loans. As stated in this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/personal-finance/american-debt-auto-loan-debt/), "" Auto loans now make up nearly 10% of all household debt, the third largest debt category behind mortgages and student loans. "" While this may not be that surprising, the point is these things are an extremely heavy burden for individuals. Additionally, cars are a significantly more liquid asset to sell than a home... more on this later.

&#x200B;

Similar to what was observed in the run-up to the housing market crash, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of sub-prime loans for automobiles. You can read about this [here](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/auto-loan-subprime-crisis/).

&#x200B;

Essentially, what we are seeing in the auto industry is the same thing as the housing market: people are taking out way too large of loans they cannot afford.

&#x200B;

**How does this relate to the current state of the economy?**

&#x200B;

All of this being said, we know what happens when an economy is hurled into a recession. Companies layoff employees, debts stop being repaid, and people / businesses begin defaulting on their loans.

&#x200B;

Since people are extremely leveraged on their car loans, any hiccup to their income may cause difficulty in repaying the loan. This will cause millions of car owners to either sell their car or it will get repossessed. Here is the intro to econ level analysis of how this scenario plays out:

&#x200B;

People lose jobs

...................**This causes demand of used cars to increase**

Can't afford car loan

Sell / get car repossessed

...................**This causes supply of used cars to increase**

The increased supply and increased demand of used cars causes total quantity demanded to increase (rather dramatically, depending on your opinion of the future of the economy).

&#x200B;

There are only so many cars being sold around the country / world. With the quantity demanded of used cars increasing, the demand for new cars will decrease. As a result, firms such as GM and FCAU may struggle to stay in business, let alone make a profit.

&#x200B;

Short GM and FCAU... Also Wells Fargo seems interesting. Also I am stupid don't listen.

EDIT: I keep seeing people bring up TSLA. I am too poor for that. I would assume the same rule applies. The biggest concern would be the government subsidizing EV companies",2020-03-06 16:32:40

The more it all doesn't work. Money is pieces of literally useless paper (as are numbers on an LCD screen) that only have any value because we agree that it does. Think about that. 

Repo is a poor choice of meme word but for what it represents it's agreements between banks and financial institutions writing contracts saying eachothers money exists and will tomorrow and that you can borrow it for a day or two for a price ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Banks will leverage this between each other in order to provide LIQUIDITY.  If you don't need it you're selling the repos if you do need it you're buying them. This is a good thing. Think about that. 

 If repo interest rates went up because all the money was already invested in this epic bull market and one entity saw an opportunity to raise the rates because it's a free market, don't be surprised or think the system is broken. Banks literally exist to find any and all opportunities to make money off someone els s money. It doesn't mean the system broke it means for a short while some bank saw an opportunity to charge a higher overnight repo rate similarly to how sellers on Amazon are selling coronavirus masks for $270 for a pack of ten when a few weeks ago that same thing cost $19.99 Think about that.

If you look into the details of the filing, it indicates an original issue discount (OID), so there is an imputed amount of interest based on the principal value of the notes and the issue value (looks like 997,950,000 euros). That comes out to about a 0.205% yield from issue to maturity, and based on the prospectus dates, that is about 0.041% annualized yield. That's what you get when the government (EU) has negative interest rates with their crazy QE over there.

It's crazy that there are people who want negative rates here, just to prop shit up more. This bull market of 10 years age is somewhat artificial in my book because the fed has kept interest rates at historical lows most of its run, dousing consumer spending with QE and inflating the stock market to levels that have begun to show instability for the last six months or so (earnings have been fairly flat across the S&P 500 yet the market continued to rise).

I think the Fed needs to let the market take its course (in fact, the more they cut rates the worse the end result could be). If they don't, they may only be delaying the ground falling out underneath everything since the banks will eventually pull the money when they aren't getting any yield.",2020-03-08 08:08:45

Anyway

According to some supreme Supreme Court ruling, private prisons have to provide healthcare for their “guests.” The two largest public private prison companies are GEO Group (I hate them) and Core Civic (I hate them too). Now I’m not sure about Geo Group, but according to a wHaRtOn BuSiNeSs ScHoOl study, healthcare related costs are the 2nd largest expenditure for the company (EDIT: Corecivic) behind, you guessed it, staff (not the staph infection).

There are reports of the beerflu spreading among prisoners in China but there’s not enough data to say definitively what the rates in their prisons are. However, in Korea (there’s only on real Korea) there are reports of nearly ALL patients in a psychiatric (similar in quarters to prisons) ward contracting the virus.

Now it’s seems like Geo Group owns more prisons near the coasts while Core Civic owns more inland and in the Midwest. Would be nice to get some age demographics on populations of each companies “guests” but I haven’t been able to find that really.

Basically once this virus starts to hit prison populations their malnourished guests may legally require a lot of treatment, expensive policies may have to be put in place to reduce spread, and there will inevitably be lawsuits from negligence.

Someone tell me why I’m a retard and why this is all incorrect before I buy some puts on GEO or CXW 3 or so months out.

This after Gray bought a minority stake in $TGNA’s OTT ad company Premion for $100M last week and then made a $8.5B offer for TGNA broadcasting biz. 

TGNA sells their broadcasting biz to either GTN or Apollo and then takes their Premion biz public. Premion is probably more valuable than Tradedesk $TTD that trades for $260 a share. 

For $18 a share you can own a stock that is gonna cost Apollo or GTN $25 a share and then they’re gonna take the leftovers (Premion ) biz public.",2020-03-08 06:40:57

**Quick Background**: 

India has a population of 1.4 billion. It has a growth rate of 1.1% in 2017. It has a mainly young age demographic is 28.1 (2018 est. ). Because of this young population which has been rapidly increasing, its GDP has been rapidly increasing, alongside its influence worldwide and building deeper and more intricate trade relations with other countries, however its growth has been limited by extensive govt corruption from local to national level, high level of inflation, massive amounts of protectionism for its poor farmers – instead of spending to education the farmers instead. 

The urban growth rate of India has been slowing down in recent years but is still above the global average. India : 2.3% compared to World’s 1.936%.

Now the actual numbers and where options come into play:  
 

There’s 2 ETF’s for India. INDA and SMIN. I will be doing INDA. Easier to do so as its larger caps. The INDA ETF is made up of:

1. RELIANCE - .  is an Indian conglomerate in all sectors ( like the Indian version of Samsung without the phones, DRAM and other electronics).

2.HDFC is the largest bank by market cap in India and is the largest lender too.

3.INFY -  Infosys Limited is an Indian multinational corporation that provides business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services.

4.ICICIBANK  is the second largest bank in India in terms of assets and market capitalisation.

5.TCS is an Indian multinational information technology service and consulting company 

6.HINDUNILVR is the Indian subsidiary of Unilever

7.AXISBANK  is the fifth-largest Indian bank offering a wide assortment of financial products.

8.BHARTIARTL is the third largest mobile network operator in India and the second largest mobile network operator in the world with over 411.42 million subscribers 

9.INR, is the Indian Rupee. 

10. BAJFINANCE - a subsidiary of [Bajaj Finserv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaj_Finserv), is an Indian Non-Banking Financial Company ([NBFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBFC)). The company deals in [Consumer Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Finance), SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) and Commercial Lending, and [Wealth Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_Management).

All these are consumer-based companies and all are quite strong from the little DD I have done on each individually but that can be done later or not at all depending on my mood. Im here to talk about the whole thing instead. 

Now India is suffering from social, biological and economic problems and I will break them down one by one:

**Biological**: (namely the Beer Flu): 

There are currently 31 cases of Covid- 19 in India across the country, looking at numbers from countries that are cleaner and have better healthcare systems – that number should be around 500 and the testing is not being done fast enough or the cases are about to come out very  soon assuming the Indian govt is ahead of the virus and testing kits. India is very dense in the cities, polluted and many areas are proper shitholes (come at me, but it’s true). This is prime infection areas for the virus. Indians lack the idea of personal space – this is seen by the overcrowded trains with people everywhere on them, the pictures of the roads and other transportation systems. (Don’t call me racist – its true. Ask a civilised Indian like moi).

The Healthcare system in India is 6/10 as many doctors leave for the West in hopes of a better quality of life. The healthcare system in India is the most privatised healthcare system and is relatively cheap for Americans. The public system is much more corrupt than the private sector which is quite ironic for the commies reading this.

Healthcare and drugs in India have a large component of their raw materials coming from China – and the imports from there have decreased. This is going to affect India YUGELY. [https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/coronavirus-spotlights-india-drug-industrys-reliance-china](https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/coronavirus-spotlights-india-drug-industrys-reliance-china)

According to the [United Nations](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html), in India, about 48 out of every 1,000 newborns die before reaching the age of five. It is one of the [highest ](https://www.unicef.org/publications/files/UNICEF_SOWC_2016.pdf)under-five child mortality rates in South Asia (behind [Afghanistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html) at 91 and Pakistan at 81). In terms of numbers, [India](https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/india.html) has the largest share of global under-five deaths at 1.3 million annually.

However, India has been able to stand up to the Polio and eradicating it, the swine flu pandemic in 2009 and the later Nipah virus (which ironically came from bats as well.) India has been able to handle these viruses by detecting them early and doing whatever is necessary such as the killing of a million pigs. India has been able to coordinate testing and has tested over 600,000 people at major airports and is currently monitoring 27,000 people near the border of Nepal. 

On the other hand, Indians can be retarded – homeopathic remedies are going viral over Whatsapp across the country. A couple of weeks ago, the Indian authorities actually recommended homeopathy as a measure. [https://www.sciencealert.com/india-s-government-is-recommending-homeopathy-to-ward-off-the-coronavirus](https://www.sciencealert.com/india-s-government-is-recommending-homeopathy-to-ward-off-the-coronavirus). 

( I’m not going to carry on but here’s a link ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51747932](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51747932)).

**Macro-economic** – 

India’s inflation rate is high, currently the 2020 level is 7.59%. ([https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/inflation-cpi))

Much of it led by food inflation which has been destroying lower middle class and working -class citizen’s buying power. It has reached double digits before and is currently at a rate of 13.63%. ([https://tradingeconomics.com/india/food-inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/food-inflation)).

It’s CPI is currently 50% higher than it was in 2012 ([https://tradingeconomics.com/india/consumer-price-index-cpi](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/consumer-price-index-cpi)) and has been generally increasing at a rate of 7.6% YoY.

India is corrupt from the bottom to the top as I said before and this is the main reason why China was able to advance at a much quicker pace than India was in the last 40 years even though both countries started off in similar positions after wars during the 1940s. India has many laws and regulations in place that have stopped the Indian economy from actively building momentum using FDI and domestic investment. It has relied on a cheap rupee, its education that teaches Indians English at an early age and the large ass population that can be exploited by TNCs and domestic users. The middle class in India is expanding and getting richer – however this doesn’t help the country when people are highly regulated by both culture and the government – with high barriers of costs to start a business up in India – which funnily enough doesn’t apply to larger international players i.e. Coca Cola in Rajasthan. 

Now looking at the Indian stock market in general: 

The SENSEX has risen by 114% since Mar 2010 while the SP500 has risen by 152%. Seems reasonable, right? NOO! Look at the fucking inflation. If you put in $1000 in the SENSEX, and after inflation, pulled it out – you would currently have $1350. If you put it in SPY, you would have $1574. That is a difference by about 17% which is a year’s earnings for the long term investor and is 2 years of SPY growth at 8% YoY. 

Now India has had a growth of nearly 200% in GDP since 2010 but its stock market has risen by only 114%. While the US GDP has increased by around 50% and 152%. That shows a difference in both countries’ ideas on the stock market and the difference between a silent administration expanding the stock market through QE and rate cuts, compared to a country that does neither frequently if at all.

Currently, 10 Year Indian Bonds have a yield of 6.185% which may look inviting but looking at the inflation rates, it might as well be a negative yield compared to the USD. ([https://tradingeconomics.com/india/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/india/government-bond-yield))

Ill break down the INDA constituents with their exposure to China as that is going to lead to the most losses in revenue first before hitting the Indian economy and then them lowering guidance with a decrease in revenue and profit for these companies.

Reliance – Reliance was affected during the Sino – US trade war, it had a decrease of 4.5% in its petrochemical sector exports. That’s not a lot. Like a percent maybe. However, that number will explode as the numbers come in and people start to see the effects of a slowdown worldwide in economic activity – including India.

Reliance is involved in energy, petrochemicals, textiles, natural resources, retail, and telecommunications. All of these except for maybe telecommunications will be massively affected by the corona virus and impending bear market coming to kill all perma-bulls. 

Tl;dr : all of these companies are going to be hit. I haven’t done the necessary DD but if there is enough demand for DD on all of these companies then I shall answer the people in a 2nd part in due course. 

However, all these 9 companies make a profit and profit-making companies can use the money (especially finance companies) to start the economy back up again. Loss making companies (more likely in the small cap ETF) will be massively affected by this upcoming shakedown maybe even recession. 

Social:

Ooh the big one affecting the economy more than the ETF but wider reading is always better and makes you sound better. Currently the Prime Minister of India is a man named Narenda Modi. (read more: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra\_Modi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi)).

A BJP politician and supposed Hindu Nationalist according to r/india and muslims on social media. ( don’t attack me because I call him supposed, I don’t really care what you call him – this is about the Citizen Amendment Bill). The CAB is a new bill that has been passed which removes the chance for Muslim refugees/asylum seekers and immigrants to get citizenship easily while still allowing all other religions. Now this bill fucked shit up across India- riots across the country in Muslim states in the East, fights between Hindu nationalists and Muslim Nationalists across the capital and the police doing nothing. Indians already didn’t care about personal space but this changes it because people are dying, there’s much more contact between people that is very good for the virus as it gets to spread but its not good for the Indians who get it but then again – kinda deserve it for beating the shit out of their fellow men for no reason except tribalism and religion.

Social problems also include the caste system: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste\_system\_in\_India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India)

And corruption. Now if this was a macroeconomics/politics, I would go in more depth and if you would like me to then comment below telling me to do so and I will post a much more in depth post about the social issues of India along with the DD of those 9 companies. 

INDA is currently trading at $30.67 and is currently down 15.71% from market highs.

My actual thoughts on INDA: I believe it will go down further but it requires puts a few months out for the CV to hit the market. I think the ETF will hit at least a price of $27 in the next few months ( around June to September) unless a vaccine comes out in the next 2 months ( highly unlikely) and I doubt the vaccine can save this market from hitting -20% to -30% ( for all countries not just India).

{Disclaimer: I will be buying puts this week. I was unsure of where India was actually heading until my DD was completed. There are 3 parts I haven’t put in properly: social issues, DD of these companies and the actual extent of the corruption across the country}",2020-03-08 04:53:44
DD,Puts on UK $EWU,27,ff46j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ff46j2/puts_on_uk_ewu/,22,1583655106.0,"Why we should be worried for the UK

Some notes about the UK's lack of preparedness and proactivity that will likely contribute to a sustained and costly epidemic in the region. Note that many of these factors are applicable the USA and various other European regions.

Nb. This is intended to be informational for people within the UK so please comment if I have missed anything or if you feel any corrections are warranted.

* No social distancing measures.

* Telling the general public that masks are not effective. In Taiwan, HK and Korea the official line is that wearing a simple surgical mask will make you 5 times less likely to become infected from exposure and significantly decrease the likelihood of the wearer infecting others. TVBS, SCMP etc.

* Daily UK TV news spots claiming ""This is just a Flu"" whilst WHO have reported that Covid19 fatality rate is 34 times higher and the hospitalisation rate is 10 times higher for severe cases and 25 times higher for critical cases. BBC News, Sky News etc.

* UK media reporting a 1% CFR even though the WHO has explicitly stated 3.4% CFR numerous times. BBC, Guardian, Sky News, Daily Mail, Telegraph etc.

* Number of positive cases in the UK being portrayed by local media as the ""Total number of infections"" and not qualified as being the ""Total number of known infections"" which is a considerable difference. BBC, Guardian, Sky News, Express, Daily Mail etc.

* UK govt building projections re: hospital demand around a 4% hospitalisation rate whilst the WHO have stated this is a steady 20% (and worse in Italy) with 25% of hospitalised cases requiring ventilators which are already in short supply in UK hospitals.

* UK quarantine guidelines are still based around the 2 week incubation model which we now know to be incorrect as of latest official figures from WHO. UK media still publishing incorrect information with regards to incubation periods. Guardian, BBC etc.

* In the UK, the rate of hospital beds per person is very low compared to China where most epidemiological data has been collected on Covid19/SARS-Cov-2 thus far. Per WHO figures, China has hospital capacity for 0.42% of the population whilst the UK has capacity for only 0.24%, most of which is already in use year round.

* UK media and Govt. are repeatedly leaning on the talking point that ""..many mild cases are being missed"" even though the WHO has stated officially that they do not believe such cases were missed and the majority of ""mild"" cases were still pneumonic to some degree. So much so that chest CT was still effective in identifying mild cases.

* Massive local shortages of masks and hand sanitizer.

* Steady proliferation of disinformation re: the Covid19/SARS-Cov-2 on UK social media. Eg. ""Masks not effective, hand sanitizer only kills bacteria etc.""

* Already high demand for existing hospital beds. Eg. Very sick non-Covd19 patients already unable to get a bed in an appropriate ward much of the time.

* Existing staffing issues in NHS hospitals will likely be compounded as the epidemic progresses.

* Indirect non-Covid19 deaths will likely occur due to lack of hospital beds / risk of contagion prohibiting hospitalisation of the elderly and infirm.

* Higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions in the middle age to elderly risk group compared to China where most of the epidemiological data has been collected with regards to SARS-Cov-2/Covid19.

* Limited capacity to provide chest CT scanning in UK hospitals. Chest x-ray, for which most UK hospitals have some capacity is not effective in detecting signs of Covid19 as shown in Chinese and Italian data.

""Yeah, yeah, but Disney went from 140 to 115 already."" So fucking what? Closure of the parks is inevitable and will be the main catalyst for the drop to 80. California is already closing schools, it's only a matter of days when Disneyland closes there. It will be followed by Florida sooner or later, not to mention Paris. Some moron responded to my comment a few days ago ""Do yOu ReAlLy ThInK DiSnEy wIlL cLoSe PaRkS?"" Nah bro they'll be all chilling there while we'll have over 100 deaths followed by 2000 cases, empty shelves in Costco and nationwide panic-picnic next week. Parks in Asia have slim influence on Disney's revenue because the company owns only 43% of Shanghai's resort, 47% of Hong Kong's, and 0% (!) of Tokyo's (the company gets pennies from licensing fees). BUT the resorts that are making almost 20% of entire Disney's revenue have not been closed yet, and this is your opportunity to buy puts, retard.

Second - Mulan, and Black Widow premieres. Mulan was supposed to be huge money-maker for Disney this year, with main revenue from China. Hey, guess what - almost all movie theaters in China are closed (soon the majority of the theaters in Europe and the US will follow) and I don't feel like people there will be in the mood, even a month from now, to go out with 100 other randoms to chill and watch Mulan without Mushu, locked in some tiny dickhole building. Disney DID NOT reschedule movie premiere yet - but recently No Time To Die was moved from April to November, so think about it. The number of cases in Europe and the USA at the supposed day premiere of March 27th will be almost as gigantic as the play you are reading about rn. As of today, the USA tested only around 2000 people. Yes, 2-fucking thousand ONLY. 

But I'm here to give you strike price and expiration date, not to convince you about the beervirus seriousness. Remember, whether or not you believe this is just flu - market will not see it that way. So go fuck yourself and buy $90p 3/27 or if you like the risk $95p 3/20.

**TLDR: Company go big boom many money. wife cuck husband make him buy solar panel. Calls $23-28 March 20 capitalize on big volume or may options for earnings $25+**

**Solar doesn't seem affected by 🌈 🐻 beer virus. Sun keeps shining**

This is what I'm talking about. You see those solar panels in the rich neighborhoods? That's SunRun. It's the perfect company for middle-upper class suburban normies to feel better about their footprint and so all the housewives can tell eachother how green they are. Super foods? Nah. Kale chips? Nah. Solar panels motherfucker. This shit right here:

https://i.imgur.com/TzSjcJA.png

Even bestbuy is getting on board selling this shit.

SunRun takes the hard part out of the equation. Their solar panels and batteries are resold Panasonic equipment. Panasonic just canceled their solar panel deal with TSLA, but they're still strong with SunRun:

https://marketwatch.com/story/panasonic-drops-out-of-solar-panel-partnership-with-tesla-2020-02-26

Panasonic knows its easier to just pump these mother fuckers out to companies like SunRun than form some 🌈 🐻 partnership with Tesla.

Sunrun is in my area (MA) and they're booming, look at this:

https://i.imgur.com/R8FuX7I.png

They're pumping out offices to sell solar panels to housewives at an extreme rate. It's already all over California. They even formed a partnership with my energy company, and our energy company gives us incentives to go with Sunrun.

**Company Hiring**

Let's focus on their hiring for a second. They're hiring a billion retards for their massive growth:

https://i.imgur.com/AZOAtaF.png

687 Listings on LinkedIn, 500 on indeed, more on their website. Anything from Software Engineers to VPs to marketers, etc.

They're in the process of expanding their company nationwide and hiring out the yahoo to do so, practically handing out jobs. One of their main issues last year was they couldn't hire enough retards to sell this shit, what kind of company can say that.

Once a housewife buys this shit, she tells all her friends and they **cuck the fuck out of their husbands to get solar panels too.** Even better SunRun is ran by an empowered super woman. Check out this article showing you how brave and strong she is:

https://nytimes.com/2020/01/23/business/lynn-jurich-sunrun.html

**Earnings**

Good or bad earnings, these guys JUMP insanely on earnings news. Next earnings date is in May.

Q3 2019: Beat EPS by 450%

Q4 2019: Missed EPS but beat Revenue

This is normal during a hyper-growth stage, more money is being put into company spending, they're also buying back stock, opening new offices, hiring a billion people, etc. It's no worry as revenue did not miss, which is what you'd expect. Plus who the fuck buys solar panels in the winter?

They are floating **a ton of cash** for a company their size. Their assets are dank AF and show they're getting ready to POP. Don't believe the 🌈 🐻that tried to downplay sunrun last earnings, they have already recovered, eating away all the losses.

**Take a look at any neighborhood near you on Google Satellite, and you'll see just how popular solar panels are getting, its the next big thing. Buy whatever the housewives want, they control their husbands.**

**Volume**

They have great volume for their size surprisingly. I haven't played the options market with them yet, but it seems like a steady amount of activity, mostly bullish. 

**Here is some of their option activity I've seen by major investors:**

https://i.imgur.com/N5XE59B.png

**Recent off the market print @22.47 a share (current $20.22):**

https://i.imgur.com/y0SkDWy.png

That's an 18% volume print.

**Competitors and Similar Companies:**

SunRun is a bit unique, they don't seem to have any competition that is moving this fast, spreading to this many markets, etc. 

**One of their main competitors was SolarCity, and SolarCity is dead, and Tesla Solar (solarcity) just lost their Panasonic partnership.**

**Conclusion:**

I think SunRun is in a position to greatly grow their company, they're already expanding at a ludicrous rate, hiring as many employees as they can, and emerging in new cities, forming deals with local energy companies for incentives to the buyer, etc. I knew nothing about them until my energy company National Grid sent me information about them. They've mailed pamphlets to all their customers, and in MA we care a lot about sustainable energy (we even get to pick if we want our energy to come from renewable resources).

With the recent market activity regarding them, it seems that the major investors are waking up to this too. With the recent downside we've seen across the market, they're sitting at a very tolerable price for new investors.

For options taking into consideration the bullish major investor purchasing, I'd say any March 20 calls ($23,$24,$25,$27,$28) to capitalize on any pop and for an earnings play, you'd want May 20 ($25+). They're pretty cheap you could pick up a few yolos for 20 in tendies.

Intro of the Eurodollar

An introduction about the repo liquidity crisis in Sep 2019 – Dec 2019

How did the beer virus changed everything and the possibility of having another financial system collapse

Is Deutsche bank the new Lehman Brothers?

&#x200B;

Please tell me if there are any problems with my DD.

&#x200B;

Intro of the Eurodollar:

Firstly, the USD is the global currency that everyone uses for most economic transactions, but most of the transactions outside of the US was done in the form of Eurodollars. In the 1960s, there was a full-fledged Eurodollar market operating entirely outside of the US banking system and therefore without US regulation.

So, what are Eurodollars? According to Milton Friedman, Eurodollar system creates new US dollar money supply out of thin air at the stroke of a bookkeeper’s pen with no backing by gold or by physical cash issued by the US Treasury. Because all of this was happening outside of the US banking system, it was exempt from regulation that would have otherwise prevented it from occurring inside the US banking system.

The leverage ratio was mostly made on a 1:9 basis (100000 USD creates an additional 900000 USD to banks outside of the US) but not a single dollar was moved and remains as a interbank liability, which should means that the money still remains in the bank of the US, but banks outside of the US still has 9 times leverage thanks to US banks giving it US liquidity.

According to Jeffrey Snider first PowerPoint (link of his podcasts and the PowerPoint could be found at the Res section) The origins of the US dollar shortage during the crisis are linked to the expansion since 2000 in banks’ international balance sheets. The outstanding stock of banks’ foreign claims grew from $10 trillion at the beginning of 2000 to $34 trillion by end-2007, a significant expansion even when scaled by global economic activity. The year-on-year growth in foreign claims approached 30% by mid-2007, up from around 10% in 2001.

So, the world was short on dollars due to over expansion and over lending which led to a shortage of USD/ a liquidity squeeze and the market collapsed fearing the lack of USD at least according to Jeffrey Snider.

The feds than step in and starts to print juicy USD to satisfy the masses known as QE.  The world was back to track and continues to lend out those Eurodollars like normal to outside of the US, until 2019.

&#x200B;

Repo liquidity crisis in late 2019:

While the feds have been pumping 100 Bn repo loans to banks in Mar 5 due to high liquidity shortage:

New York Fed had pumped $100 billion in 1-day repo loans into the trading houses on Wall Street, $8.6 billion short of what the trading houses had sought to borrow. Even at the peak of the repo loan crisis that began on September 17, 2019 and through the end of January 2020, the Fed had never pumped out $100 billion in 1-day repo loans on a single day. Yesterday, the Fed pumped out another $100 billion in 1-day repo loans against demand for $111 billion – further evidence that Wall Street firms are in need of liquidity.

The fed has been pumping smaller amounts of repo loans beginning during a crisis between Sep – Dec 2019, nobody knows what trigger it, but it just happens suddenly:

In the week of Sept. 16, a lot of cash flowed out of the repo pipes just as more securities were flowing in -- meaning that suddenly there wasn’t enough cash for those who needed it. That mismatch drove overnight repo rates to 10% on Sept. 17, from about 2% the week before. And the feds begins to step in and provide liquidity to the masses again by the Not QE operation.

September 27: at least $75 billion in overnight repos, and at least $30 billion in 14-day repos

September 30 to October 10: at least $75 billion in overnight repos

In total more than $320 billion of total repo market support from the Fed since Sept. 17, when for the central bank began pumping in daily liquidity after overnight lending rates jumped to almost 10% from nearly 2%.

Pic of the total repo operation Sep-Dec 2019: [https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2019/12/03/Photos/NS/MW-HW284\_Bianco\_20191203143402\_NS.jpg?uuid=dc0fca12-1603-11ea-90a4-9c8e992d421e](https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2019/12/03/Photos/NS/MW-HW284_Bianco_20191203143402_NS.jpg?uuid=dc0fca12-1603-11ea-90a4-9c8e992d421e)

JPMorgan even secretly swapping dollars out for U.S. Treasury instruments, estimates could be high as $250 billion worth.

But nevertheless, a crisis that people outside of the financial circle never know about was safely avoided and while there could be a crisis in the future, 2019 is safe for now, the crisis may come one day but not that fast…. Until the beer virus suddenly rams through the door.

&#x200B;

The beer virus:

In an interconnected world where money, cargo and people travel across continents more frequent than ever. The beer virus has suddenly created the First Global Supply-Chain Crisis and causes an unprecedent demand and supply shock that no one knows what would happen.

Picture of the economic impact of the beer virus to countries: [https://promarket.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CORONAVIRUS2.jpg](https://promarket.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CORONAVIRUS2.jpg)

The fed suddenly went into panic mode, the 2008 crisis was caused by many debts (including debts from real estate) and not being repaid, imagine what would happen on a global scale when everything suddenly comes to a halt?

A 50-rate cut comes but the market still drops down, the banks are in extreme panic and there are massive bonds buying everyday but the buying was already started since Dec 2019. This shows that there might be some problems the big banks/feds may know about, but they seems to be hiding about it.

Remember the Eurodollar that was being used by everyone and was leveraged around 9x ratio? Even if there is a small liquidity squeeze, a chain reaction would occur and bring the global financial system down. So, I would not surprise a 75 point rate comes, but the virus is causing a supply chain problem and it seems that the point cut is unlikely to save the market unless the Fed starts to QE again since the repo market is already facing liquidity problems again, with 116 Bn shortage on Mar 5 and the Fed is just pumping 100 Bn.

So keep an eye on the repo market, the more liqudity shortage is has the more possibly the banks would need to sell its assets for cash causing a further market decline (see Short intro about the repo market)

&#x200B;

Deutsche bank the new Lehman Brothers?

When most banks stock prices climbs up above or at least remains at around 2008 levels, Deutsche bank stock price in 2008 is 24.39 and now is just 7.59 with a market cap of only 15.86 Bn. Considering banks like BOA has a market cap around 220 Bn, the fourth largest bank in Europe  had total assets of 1.541 trillion dollars and total liabilities of 1.469 trillion dollars but with just a pathetic net income of 341 Mil in 2018 and only 15.86 Bn market capital should show you that there is high probability of it to go bust.

But the problem is Deutsche bank could be the new Lehman Brothers because it has 49 trillion dollars in exposure to derivatives, it puts Deutsche Bank in the same league as the bank holding companies of U.S. juggernauts JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, which logged in at $48 trillion, $47 trillion and $42 trillion, respectively, at the end of December 2018 according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Furthermore, Deutsche Bank is heavily interconnected financially to JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America as well as other mega banks in Europe.

The negative interest rate have made banks in Europe unable to generate profits and some debt defaults like 2-4% rate would already send the bank to bankruptcy combine with a potential USD shortage and the beer virus spreading in Europe causing havoc, Deutsche bank could become the new Lehman brothers and with its high exposures to derivatives should ring some warning sounds to all of us.

A graph of its connection with other banks: [https://wallstreetonparade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Systemic-Risk-Among-Deutsche-Bank-and-Global-Systemically-Important-Banks.jpg](https://wallstreetonparade.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Systemic-Risk-Among-Deutsche-Bank-and-Global-Systemically-Important-Banks.jpg)

Conclusion:

I would highly recommend to pay attention to recent news since there are so many factors that any of it could easily make the whole modern financial system collapse and also remember that we are also facing a supply chain event that there is no historical precedent. So have fun all

Tl;dr I think we are F’ed

Edit 1:Thanks for the award, I'm tired after writing this. I see that my post doesn't have any critical mistakes, but simply something went missing.

So there is the Libor market which is the largest middle man in the world and there is also a global swap network for central banks, currently it seems there are some problems with Libor too, anyway I think I don't want to read more about Libor and other stuff, since is sort of out of the subject? I can't find something about Libor and the liquidity shortage on USD

The point of the whole post is that there is already some cracks in the financial system in late 2019, if it wasn't for the beer virus people the liquidity crisis would mostly be forgotten and the market would be unlikely to drop for like 1-2 years . Since trump doesn't want the market to go bust .

But the beer virus suddenly happened and the Fed are printing those juicy USD again+ we are all in crisis mode, so the post just focus on repo since the subject focusing here was the potential future and the history about USD liquidity shortage.

After all, only the US Fed could print USD and other banks can't make USD out of thin air especially if you already leverage 9x from your original USD.

&#x200B;

1. They refused ship's request to disembark because it had sick people on it (ship was required to submit paperwork before docking, as per protocols)
2. They refused ship's request to get 2 passengers medivac'd out via Grand Turk island.

... so not only are those people sick. They are so sick that they need immediate attention? Fuck! Would hate to be on that boat. CCL could seriously be going bankrupt.

There is almost 0 bullish sentiment here. 

Take this for what you will. I posted yesterday I thought that commercial real estate would take a huge hit as a result of supply disruption from China and possible consumer demand reduction for goods other than essentials. I work somewhat in the comm. real estate industry by the nation's second busiest port and there is an oversupply of big box warehouses. I am hearing of huge reductions in imports in the last 2 months, containerships arriving half-loaded, etc. This all represents lost sales to importers. Trucking and logistics companies suffer as well, bankruptcies in trucking are up, even before coronavirus. Warehouse vacancies were already starting to creep up. Malls and big strip mall vacancies will continue to trend up as ecommerce takes over.

It goes without saying hotels are getting fucked already. It remains to be seen if residential real estate is going to take a hit with the rates going lower and lower, maybe not.

Consumers are panicking and literally emptying shelves of goods. Almost Every thread on WSB and Coronavirus are about people stocking up on canned goods, toilet paper, bleach, etc. this reminds me of a country going to war... people pull forward their spending in preparation for a shortage. But what if the shortage doesn’t come? What if China is already going back to work? Conversely, what if a shortage DOES come? Prices rise and companies make more product. In my mind this might be a win/win for consumer retail stocks like Amazon/Costco/WMT. Costco’s comps were up double digits for the first time in years. Amazon is sold out of a ton of items, WMT is the same way.

Literally thousand if not millions of things being handed off EVERY SINGLE DAY

The virus can stay dormant for two weeks while still being contagious

Any cold drink purchased at Starbucks is more likely to have the beer because the virus can live on water longer, the condensation outside will help it survive

For hot drinks the barista hands you the drink with a hot cover to not burn yourself but what does this mean? It’s not directly contacting the heat so it’s not killing of the virus and giving it enough time to go from the baristas hand, to yours, to then you touching your fucking face and then kissing your BF who then in turn kisses your wife and then she’s Kisses someone else

And just with one drink you now have 4 more people infected + the original barista

Key notes

COVID-19 has multiple economic impacts including workers having to stay  home, interruptions to supply chains, disruptions to small businesses  and hourly workers, and export-dependent businesses struggling to  deliver products to key international markets. I convened a state  COVID-19 Economic Retention and Recovery Taskforce, which rapidly  compiled a [List of Resources for Businesses and Workers Impacted by COVID-19](https://www.governor.wa.gov/node/439842). This list is posted on my homepage ([wa.gov](https://www.governor.wa.gov/)) and is regularly updated. 

&#x200B;

 In addition, the business and labor communities have an important  leadership role to play, and I have been encouraged by the response to  my call to action. I am hearing many stories of employers doing the  right thing and helping to keep wages intact for workers who are working  from home or cannot work due to COVID-19. For those who are dependent  on state services to maintain economic security, we are working  diligently with our agencies to ensure as many impacted workers as  possible are served. ESD has a resource [here](https://esd.wa.gov/newsroom/covid-19). 

&#x200B;

 We are working diligently with our state and federal lawmakers  to significantly increase funding for public health and economic  development, while facilitating rules and regulations that could provide  relief to businesses and workers impacted by COVID-19.",2020-03-07 09:31:07

DD,relative higher prices in the current market,16,ffool8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffool8/relative_higher_prices_in_the_current_market/,10,1583754221.0," Hello today I will like to mention the idea of relative volatility and higher pricing since I believe it pertains to our current situation in the markets.

Think of volatility as a pond that is very calm. Every now and then a small pebble from a mountain above falls into this calm body of water and little ripples occur and eventually spread out. In this situation a pebble would be a **catalyst** and the little ripples would be considered **volatility**. The mountain?, that's the random factor it could the be the economy, government who knows. All we care is that it provides pebbles that fall down. Now if we were observers in the side of this pond we would typically bet that such small pebbles in such a calm environment are due to end and that although the ripples are visible, they are not strong in nature. We so accustomed to seeing such calm water and small pebbles, why should we believe otherwise?

Now lets assume that their are creatures that live on the side of this pond. They build houses, businesses, etc. Let's call these things **underlyings**, they could be equities, commodities who knows.

Now us being the smarty pants we are decide that we could make a living by selling insurance to these creatures. So much so that we decide to make a business by selling insurance to the creatures, and in doing so we will call ourselves market makers. Lets call these insurance methods, **derivatives** but specifically in this case **options**. Well years go by and we are making a grand profit. This is for a number of reasons. 1) the ponds have been calm for a couple of years now, relatively. 2) when they are larger risks, such as larger pebbles thus creating bigger waves, the creatures are willing to pay higher premiums to protect their underlying. Thus when such occurrences happen we decide to sell insurance at a higher rate and collect more premiums, because **in the end the pond has always remained calm.**

Now in situation 2 lets consider the fact that although we believe that we can raise insurance prices higher to make more money, we don't want to scare these creatures into not buying insurance because its too damn expensive. So what do we do? Well we charge **relatively higher prices**. By charging relatively higher prices we are able to capture **a larger premium and a larger amount of customers, creating liquidity.** So although it may appear that what we are charging expensive premium, in reality we are taking larger risks by selling more insurance that we may not specifically be able to cover if the worse case scenario occurred.

Now lets suppose this time instead of a large pebble being thrown into the pond, we have a collection of medium sized pebbles that being thrown into the pond, at a **relatively faster rate** than we usually expect. Well as market makers we see this as a great opportunity to make money so we decide to sell **relatively higher premiums** on each pebble being thrown. Because in the end we can capture all these ripple pricing's at higher prices.

But we are **wrong.**

Little did we know that these medium sized pebbles were actually little small chippings of rocks from a mountain way above. And that these medium sized pebbles were actually a sign of bad structural integrity of the mountain. And therefore sometime in the future, a humongous rock falls off that mountain and crashes into the pond. Destroying all the businesses, the houses, all the underlying that no longer **intrinsic value**.

So although it seemed like a great bushiness, the real winners of such a situation would be the spectators that were betting against us at the **right time when the signs were showing. In this case it would be the medium sized pebbles being thrown at faster rates.**

Thus relative volatility proves that is not always true to be selling volatility but to find the cracks and when to buy it. Or buy a straddle who knows?",2020-03-09 07:43:41

Ok Autists, I share an article about the supply chains problemas in China last week which you could find at the resource section, I previously said that the article haven't even accounted about a potential outbreak may lead to Europe and US factories being shutdown causing a longer supply chain shortage.

I originally estimate that there might be shut downs not earlier than Mid March, now look at Italy and a 14 mil region already got shut down and we are not even at Mid March yet.

Ports in LA has been half empty since Mar 3, a twitter post says that usually there are 5 trains a day out of there, now down to 32. Usually has 16,000 trucks in the port, that's down by half.

&#x200B;

You think shit is real but things should get back normal in Mid March and china should be pumping those industrial goods now? Dead Wrong.

China could only make low to semi mid tier tech grade items, since factories are reopen back around Early March they could still use those stored inventory from Jan. But if you want to assemble an more high tech stuff like Iphone you would need parts from at least from Germany,Switzerland, Japan, US and Chinese components take a look at the pic to get an idea [here](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GN0t3RvvmWfWdoHYlgJGEe0c-ys=/2000x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Lifewire_Where_Is_The_Iphone_Made_1999503_V2-345d781fed0b48909b2fc5c6b52ff325.png) , but factories from everywhere is closing/got infected/needs quarantine at an unprecedented rate.

&#x200B;

Here are some examples:

Japan Has shut down its F35 factory in Mar 4 (An italy factory also shutdown too) [here](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/03/f-35-factory-japan-shuts-down-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/163505/)

Korea car factory shut down [here](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&year=2020&no=222523)

Samsung Wants to move its factories to Vietnam for making parts for its smartphone, but it turns out that A London-Hanoi flight has caused the beer virus to spread in Vietnam right now, things are not looking good. [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-samsung-elec/samsung-to-shift-some-smartphone-production-to-vietnam-due-to-coronavirus-idUSKBN20T10T) and [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-08/virus-outbreak-tied-to-london-hanoi-flight-rattles-vietnam)

&#x200B;

The last supply chain shock to the globe was from the earthquake that hit Japan in 2011, so most CEOs who wants to cut costs and pump their stock price has already switch to JIT and the earthquake was just a single country shock, and nobody expect a bloody global supply chain collapse since there isn't one before in history.

Currently most companies across the globe are facing the problem of not having inventory since the Chinese factories shut down in late Jan as most only runs on 15-30 day inventory.

While a report says that A total of 78 million Chinese migrant rural workers have already returned to work, accounting for 60% of the total who left for home for the Chinese New Year holiday [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-workers/china-says-78-million-migrant-rural-workers-have-returned-to-work-idUSKBN20U0A0).

But Chinese companies are still mostly producing from inventory left from Jan, as they just open back their factories and ordering new supplies would take at least one weeks for factories and Hubei is still in shutdown, there are also reports about reopening factories but no one is working and they just turn on the equipment as to satisfy the electricity quotas set by the officials [here](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/lights-are-no-ones-working-how-china-faking-coronavirus-recovery)

People with beer virus suddenly falls down and the factory got shut down [vid](https://twitter.com/SYC999/status/1236072794473074690)

I predict that China may get back to 50% production capacity for things that doesn't need external exports in late March - Early April.

Did I even talk about the second wave of disruption coming to Chinese factories? [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-factories/chinas-factories-at-risk-of-double-whammy-as-coronavirus-hits-south-korea-japan-idUSKBN20P21I)

&#x200B;

So, you may say Shit is bad but those air freight could transport shit to other countries fast, right?

Maybe, the air freight market is now being infected with WSB virus and the price is as volatile as the VIX index, the price also seems to be doubled. [pic here](https://theloadstar.com/wp-content/uploads/china-ustac.png)

Also, Sea freights which consists of 90% of global freight trade would take like a month for transporting stuff.

Most factories in Europe and US would wait to April - early May (which they are mostly run out of inventory for 1-3 months) for Cargo ship to arrive to the ports, and they could finally get their long waited inventory. Cheers Right? No Again

&#x200B;

Also,Remember there is no more spaghetti due to lock down?

Wuhan is still in lock down since late Jan and still haven't been reopen yet.

Let's assume that things are better in Italy and it would take a month to reopen back, but what would happen to nearby regions and countries like in southern Italy,Germany, France,Switzerland? If the rate of increase continues as the expected projection, it seems that they would also be in lock down and those lock down would never could be as effective as in china.

So even northern Italy reopens in a month it would still impossible to reopen business since other nearby regions would be likely in their own lock down as well.

This is due to the fact the virus spread faster than any flu virus we have seen before which is at around 2.2-2.68 rate, this is higher than the h1n1 flu of 1.46, and the beer virus is likely more deadly as the Spanish Flu (but maybe due to much higher old population than any time in history), you could look about the comparison [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics) (thanks for the covid dd post)

This is like an endless feedback loop and until a cure or a vaccine comes out(which should take more than a year), things would mostly get worse.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

So you could see how bad the supply chain problem is , the collapse of the supply chain would cause many business to shut down and debts defaults for both consumer and businesses.

Europe and Japan are already in negative rates, they are already not profitable and lower rates would likely to cause the banks unable to profit from business services and cause a financial collapse again.

You could see my other DD post talking the liquidity problem , if you are interested on supply chain problems you could follow [r/supplychain](https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/) for further updates (Both posts are attached below at the resources part)

I think I'm done writing DD posts for a while, I write this because there ins't much about supply chains discussion on WSB, but I think my 2 DD should give a whole picture on what problems we are facing.

&#x200B;

Edit:  [hey\_ross](https://www.reddit.com/user/hey_ross/) says about the shale oil debt is gonna explode due to the amount of debt, which is true:

A.because the supply chains are collapsing and factories/China won't need that much oil, two months for like 50% drop of oil demand could already lower the oil price ;

B.The shale oil industry just got 911 by the Russians and the Saudis and they are unable to be break even below 50, now the price is just 30 so a 40% decline of revenue for those shale oil companies  [pic](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/~/media/Images/research/economics/2019/0521/0521c1.png)

C. Shale oil was already having problems since 2018 and has around 200 billion debts.

As of the end of 2018, so this number is a little bit old, we’ve spent about $1 trillion in U.S. oil shale and we’ve returned about $700 billion to the companies in the form of cash flow for a whopping, negative 38% cash-on-cash return,  The total return to shareholders in the sector in the last decade was effectively zero [here](http://www.startribune.com/schafer-shale-oil-passed-its-peak-without-making-money/567884742/)

Edit 2: Someone says the fundamentals remain and my post is just fear.

The Fundamentals as of now are Northern Italy just got quarantine with a 14 mil population,Industries are stopping and labour,materials could not flow freely.

The Industrial Triangle of Italy just got quarantine,The quarantine will take over the Italian economic zones. About a third of the national gross domestic product (GDP) comes from the regions of Lombardy and Veneto. According to the financial service company Moody's, Italy's GDP will decrease by 0.5 percent this year.  [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/italy-quarantines-quarter-population-fight-coronavirus-200308071832617.html](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/italy-quarantines-quarter-population-fight-coronavirus-200308071832617.html)

And can you tell me when will it go back to normal? You can't because nobody knows. The Fundamentals just got changed until it resumes to normal where labor/materials could flow freely again and thus volatility will remain which is bad for business.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=vhm3XXQqwmk

The video goes through and explains how the repo markets work as well as the Eurodollar. Recently we have entered an inflection point in the repo markets as of May 29 of last year. Since then the expected inflation has been decreasing and central banks all across the globe have been cutting rates. The recent outbreak of the corona virus is just the feather that broke the camels back.

Also, since 2008 the global financial system, that had relied on mortgages as collateral in the repo market, has had a shortage of prime collateral because no one uses that anymore. In order to fix that issue the banks have tried to incorporate other types of collateral into the system which has introduced risk. 

The most important takeaway from the video is that the central bank is the end of the line lender because they do not know what is going on in the global financial market. Because no one truly understands the global system, no one has been able to identify the root cause of the 2008 financial crisis and resolve it. Therefore, what happened in 2008 could happen again.

This is just to implore those who follow my TA to start thinking about setting their stops a little tighter.  If we look at last quarters filings you'll see that their total assets were 45.058B, total liabilities were 19.693B giving a stockholders equity of 25.365B.  If we divide SE by shares outstanding (527m) we get about 48.13 dollars per share.  Meaning if the company went bankrupt TODAY it could sell off all of it's assets, cover it's liabilities and still disperse $48.13 per share to each of it's shareholders.  Given the news and current trends I doubt it will go up but below is my current thought on why you should tread carefully with your puts/shorts.

Ticker: CCL

Window: Daily

Indicators: 200 MA, RSI, ATR 2.39, SEC Filings (assets to liabilities, market cap, and shares outstanding.)

Signals: Under 200 MA Bearish, RSI Oversold Bearish, Under SE Per Share Value.

Position: $30p 3/20 Short term put looking for exit, Stop at 29.89 following at 2.74 above current price

Targets: The bottom has fallen out, hard to come up with future targets.  
 

Analysis: Very bearish signals overall however the stock value has drifted significantly under calculated equity per share last quarter. Tighten stops to 15% outside of ATR and ride out current position until stops are hit. After hitting stops exit the ticker entirely until there is some kind of positive news catalyst and look for long entries (call/buy).  
 

For the Retards: CCL is shit and it’s going to get shittier but it’s starting to look like boomer bait, use your stops like big boys.

A bit of research on debt loading, fixed service charges, exposure to business vs. leisure travel, etc. has led me to believe that the following companies are absolutely fucked:

* $UAL, $EXPE, $SIX, $AMC, $SEAS, $CZR, $LYV, $SAVE.

Now I hear you, thank you captain obvious. Yeah yeah, but these are actually fucked. They all need debt refis in the next 8-12 months to survive a 20% reduction in revenue. The leavers they can pull to fix this are all longer term than that are unlikely to be effective in the short term. Let's put it like this - they effectively have to get started with layoffs in the next month to survive, and some are beyond that already.

The following companies are going to survive, but have pretty large hits to market cap, primarily due to debt loading / business travel:

* $AAL - High debt, fixed charges, etc., but lower exposure to Asia travel, tech sector full price business class tix, etc. and likely going to benefit from a global oil price decrease over the coming months which should save them;
* $MAR / $HIL - High debt, but have good portion of real estate holdings, high concentration in vendors that they can likely squeeze to get temporary relief on rents, lots of hotels owned by 3rd party LP groups, etc. Debt holders will likely want to work with them.
* $MGM / $LVS - Better balance sheets, ability to survive, better management teams and more diversified holdings vs. CZR who basically only has Vegas strip.

List is obviously not exhaustive. A few ones that are likely to do relatively OK are:

* $LUV, $DAL, $JBLU (likely the best)

Now I haven't looked at everything, only the ones I had a hunch about really bad exposure to the markets. Broadly speaking, these businesses also tend to employ working class people who will be fucked by this. I was crazy sick on Feb 1-2 and spent that weekend researching the beer virus, bought May / June SPY 305p and have printed on them. I'm going to spend $30k on puts on some variation of the above (based on put prices) this Monday / Tuesday.

Crude futures are expected to drop at the open to approximately 15% (mid 30's range) which provides a very HIGH probability the market will also drop. The crude and YM and ES correlate quite well. With oil dropping this is a very good harbinger for a bloody Monday.

As you can see here -

The ES and Dow correlate with the movement of crude 83%. The NQ is \~70%. Look to the far right of the pic if too lazy to click the link.

But that's not all, in the near term there are expectations for oil to drop even further.

That being said, I plan on riding the ""V"" down and up on this one, and lastly, if you're a perma bull you're in luck I've got some companies at the bottom that I think will go up over the next few months.

**What's about to happen:**

Let's stick to the facts and correlate this puppy to a similar outbreak; H1N1: ""*From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus... Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated* "" [\[1\]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.html)

Since H1N1 got memory holed and everybody forgot about it, the virus became a modern flu, we have flu shots for this thing and chances are you've probably had it at one point or another -- it's just one of the flues that floats around each season. But the Corona is different...

First off, this thing already has a reproduction rate higher than any of the previous outbreaks in the last 150 years [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Notable_flu_pandemics). AND it's one of the most deadly -- however only to certain age groups which is a big difference [\[4\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). Now I do want to make it clear that the Spanish Flu was a lot deadlier to healthy adults, also the age demographics have changed. StatsCanada actually has a good tool that shows the population pyramid and you can compare Spanish Flu in 1918 to 2020 and it'll have some similar-ish results to the USA [\[5\]](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/pyramid/pyramid.cfm?type=1&geo1=01). There's also population pyramid tool here for the USA but it only goes back to 1950 [\[6\]](https://www.populationpyramid.net/united-states-of-america/2020/).

Buddy of mine with access to a Bloomberg terminal sent this to me the other day which tracks the spread of the Corona virus [\[7\]](https://imgur.com/a/O4J6cuc). Think the code is 'Map Virus' or something. What matters is that we can see a very obvious trend of exponential growth, in fact that's how you model these things... This thing will spread like wildfire once it starts to hit the cities in America, and... already has. [All it takes is one 'chad spreader'](https://imgur.com/a/N542fqR) to jump on the subway and it'll be a matter of weeks and the entire city is infected. In fact it's already happened in Toronto so buy puts on $CANADA [\[8\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/).

What matters is that we can see that something like \~60.8 million people who got H1N1 in the USA from 2009 to 2010 and this thing had an r0 of only like \~1.5ish. The bat soup virus currently has an estimated r0 at \~2.4 right now, mind you this is a number that varies through time and can decrease by human intervention (such as quarantines of cities), which will inevitably transpire...

If we assume that this thing spreads with even some level of similarity to H1N1 in 2009, this is going to be a bloodbath for the boomers. First and foremost, this will spread at a much higher rate among boomers and those in old folks homes, we've got evidence of that already [\[9\]](https://www.fox19.com/2020/03/07/coronavirus-concerns-stalls-cruise-ship-off-california/).

But that's not all. Italy is fucked. They just announced a quarantine of 1/4 of their fucking population [\[10\]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70). Take wild guess how that's going to fare for their economy. The FTSE MIB is down shy of 20% from it's highs as it stands right now and its only going to get worse [\[11\]](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/i945?countrycode=it). Given that the Italy  is basically a leading indicator of what's going to happen in the USA...  I fucking DARE YOU to buy spy calls.

So let's get to the nuts and bolts of this. Some autist named Dr. James Lawler stated that worst case scenario this thing could infect 96m in the USA and kill 480,000 people [\[12\]](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-dr-james-lawler-warning-us-hospitals-infection-a9385031.html). However, funny enough his estimates are based on a mortality rate of 0.5%. The current mortality rate is \~3.5% so, rather, we could be looking at up to 3,360,000 dying in the USA if the mortality rate is what it currently is.

However, we can math this based on the population pyramids I posted above. In the USA if we take the known mortality rates and population pyramid and transpose that on the worst case scenario, we're looking at shy 1.9m dead (mostly older people) given that 30% get the virus in the next year [\[13\]](https://imgur.com/a/vfOz0Nf). If this spreads at the same rate as H1N1, then we're looking at a total of \~60.8 million infected in a year's time. This corresponds to \~18.6% of the population getting it and would result in \~1.16m people dead [\[14\]](https://imgur.com/a/WUDaMza).

Now, I'm willing to bet that my boy Donnie isn't interested in losing a massive chunk of his voting block so I'm betting that we see quarantines very soon in the USA, entire cities shut down just like we've seen in China and just like we've seen in Italy and Iran. It's going to happen and when it does, the lemmings will be shocked. I mean, this shouldn't come as a surprise, there's already runs on toilet paper in Australia over this thing [\[15\]](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/australians-scrap-toilet-rolls-coronavirus-panic-buying-200308014116516.html).

Anyways, I think we'll get a cure eventually and that everybody reading this will be fine, in fact I'm not a doomer whatsoever. Society will continue on and SPY will eventually recover and I'll join bull gang again, but I'm sure Monday will be a bloodbath after Italy quarantined like 16 million people.

But back to my point, just think about what'll happen to SPY when a US city announces a quarantine. They're already preparing for it by declaring states of emergency now [\[16\]](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-202-declaring-disaster-emergency-state-new-york). The fear will be real and it already is...

**EDIT:** Figured I'd add a bit more on Canada as I don't think it's priced in up there quite yet. Again, I took some numbers from StatsCanada [\[17\]](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/91-520-x/2010001/t334-eng.htm) and plugged them in against current known mortality rates and we ended up with this [\[18\]](https://imgur.com/a/YBX7XFV). Estimated 234k dead which... is bad, but that's a flood of dead people in a short amount of time. Also I assume a 30% infection rate but I think this things going to have a much high infection rate because of the fact that we corral all our old into old folks homes... it just takes one sick caretaker and they've all got it and the worst part is that you can have it and spread it without even knowing [\[19\]](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-asymptomatic-transmission-chinese-woman-relatives-2020-2). So this basically becomes a catch-22. If elderly care takers don't show up to work because they're sick, elderly people die, if they do show up, there's a chance they're giving them COVID-19, it just takes one and they'll all catch it... real morbid stuff. Basically each old folks home is a tranche in a CDO for the few of you retards that know what I'm talking about...

So how do we profiteer from this? And what will inevitably transpire?

**EDIT 2:** [SPX e-minis currently trading at shy of -5%... we're hitting the circuit breakers tomorrow. Fed will drop rates again by end of week.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/es00)

**Conclusion:**

I know half of you retards skipped to here but kudos to the champions that read everything I wrote.

1. General stock market decline, puts on $SPY or high beta stocks if IV isn't too high
2. for my perma-bull frens, calls on funeral home and burial companies: $SCI, $CSV, $MATW, $PLC:CA, $DTY:UK, etc. **EDIT:** (as u/dollarsandcents101 pointed out be careful on funeral homes... could ban funerals if this thing really get's going)
3. Puts on old folks care homes because those are probably going to be vacant here very shortly and thus less cash flows to investors... stocks like: $WELL, $VTR $OHI, **EDIT:** $CSH.UN:CA (Canadian, option chain is a lot less liquid than USA so... be careful), SIA:CA (another one, already crashing, has options, less liquid though)
4. I'm still bearish airlines and travel... I mean go look at the chart of $AAL. After 9/11 that stock went from $40 a share to literally $2 a share... in 2003. The same thing happened during the GFC, stock again went from over $40 a share to a fucking penny stock -- traded at like $0.30 per share. Get ready for round 3... I look forward to buying calls on airlines after this is all over.
5. bearish any developing country/emerging market ETF's. They're going to get hit hard.
6. I don't know anything about medical or medical research stocks but calls and puts on companies researching corona virus cure. Again... correct me if I'm wrong but to my understanding it's zero-sum, the company that gets a solid cure makes bank and the rest are fucked but again idk this isn't my area whatsoever. Also looks like a lot of these stocks are rocketing and IV is massive so I'm sitting on the sidelines on this one

If you're from r/all wanting to get in on the tendies, I saved a special one just for you! Go all in on $LVS 80C 3/13 calls, trust me. Cannot go tits up.",2020-03-08 19:10:03

**The following news  released since Fridays OPEC failed meeting:**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/opec-meeting-coronavirus-weighs-on-oil-demand-as-oil-prices-fall.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/06/opec-meeting-coronavirus-weighs-on-oil-demand-as-oil-prices-fall.html)

&#x200B;

**Some key points from the article are as follows:**

\- OPEC and non-OPEC allies failed on Friday to agree on how much oil production to cut amid the coronavirus outbreak

\- Russia reportedly refusing to give the green light to the deepest supply cuts since the global financial crisis.

\- Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters leaving the meetings in Vienna on Friday that it meant that members could now pump what they liked starting April 1

\- “We have no reason to doubt the continued commitment of the Russian Federation to this partnership,” OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo told reporters.  **(this we know can be taken with a grain of salt and a shot of tequila.)**

THEN! this happened:

Some points from the article:

\-Saudi Arabia kicked off an all-out oil war on Saturday slashing official pricing for its crude and making the deepest cuts in at least 20 years on its main grades, in a bid to push as many barrels into the market as possible

&#x200B;

\- The collapse of the meeting between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its erstwhile partners effectively ends the cooperation between the Saudis and Russia that has underpinned oil prices since 2016.

\- Unshackled from the cartel’s restrictions and with budget holes to fill, there is every chance producers will ramp up output.

\- Saudi Arabia pumped 9.7 million barrels a day last month, but with the agreement on output cuts expiring at the end of March, the kingdom will be free to produce as much as it wants. The Saudis say they can pump as much as 12.5 million barrels a day.

*- Aramco slashed its official selling price for flagship Arab Light crude to buyers in Asia by $6 a barrel, to a discount of $3.10 below the Middle East benchmark. The cuts eclipsed the $1.90 reduction expected by traders and refiners. It also reduced Medium crude to Asia by $6 a barrel, dropping the grade to a $4.05 discount, according to the company’s pricing sheet.* ***(VERY IMPORTANT)***

***Looking into the future:***

***We are about to enter an OIL glut:***

https://preview.redd.it/xq3wldkxngl41.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=03365a3125a374059dcea1f5cb50a6c13b0fde49

So now let's look at some charts and some resistance and support levels for Crude:

&#x200B;

[Crude Oil Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/sfm77hwqjgl41.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=70257980916fd62d6fbfa0c7db5e40f6f891459e)

&#x200B;

As you can see on the monthly chart, oversold conditions haven't been encountered in over 5 years. Since our large sell off and we are approaching the $30/Barrel price. I expect the price to dip below 30 to $20-$25 before support can be found. (This is news dependent as things could change).

Our Next Support is $20 Dollars

Look for Puts in /CL Futures which provide a good cheap way to enter options contracts or any stocks ETF's ETNS or banks that are oil heavy in portfolio.

The coronavirus will shut down major cruise ships and airplane travel also pushing prices down.

They're priced like large growth is expected, and I don't see any reason Wendy's is expected to grow quickly.

50% of their customers are over 45; almost 40% over 50.

If a single case of COVID-19 is ever associated with a single Wendy's, they could see a large drop in revenue. Their financial situation does not make it easy for them to endure a negative bump in revenue. So far, the fast food industry is not one of those any government is considering for targeted aid.

I won't even insult you by linking it, because despite being 10 paragraphs long, the life-shitter failed to mention the single solitary thing that will give ATVI massive lift this week: their new free-to-play battle royale game (Warzone).

Now you're probably thinking: ""so what tard? developers announce games all the time. it's priced into their pipeline""

""No!""

The best way to explain this is to look back at EA last year when they did exactly what ATVI is doing now in stealth-dropping a F2P BR game: [https://i.imgur.com/VpoStWU.png](https://i.imgur.com/VpoStWU.png)

The fact that EA had a bad earnings report the day after launching the BR mode is unfortunate, but it further illustrates how impactful F2P BR games can be on valuation. The new game, Apex, represented an entire stream of cash flows that had not yet been baked into anyone's models. Not only that, but the game was heavily thought to be the ""Fortnite-killer"" in its first week, and as we all know, Fortnite literally prints tendies. +22% from game launch in the first 10 days speaks for itself.

This leads us to today. ATVI just announced Warzone, a F2P BR game that *also* leverages the popular-with-kids-in-their-30s brand Call of Duty. There's not a single analyst whose model incorporates the profitability of Warzone into their valuation. Not one. The game will officially launch tomorrow, dominate on Twitch, and reignite talks of there being another Fortnite-killer. The analysts will then wake up, run the numbers, and realize: ""Holy Powell, there's another 20-30% upside in this whore!""

So why am I sharing this? Very simple: I entered and I want to make money. I'm up 50k this year, thanks to you autismos, so I don't mind sharing this, and again, it helps me by getting me to higher profits faster (I'd get there anyway, but now this way you beat the smarmy fucks on the street).

TL;DR: ATVI Calls, strike: $59-60, exp: 3/13. Follow my lead for high tendies and to avoid terrible spreads in further OTM calls.

Amazon is about to AWS their Go stores and sell their cashierless technology to other retailers. Hope you're not a cashier cause your job is running out of time. 

Why is this such a big deal for Amazon? **The more stores that use this technology, the more data that Amazon gets on consumer shopping habits.** AND HERE'S THE BONKERS THING: this technology will let Amazon collect metrics on *everything* consumers are doing in a store. They'll get metrics on how often a consumer picks an item up, then puts it down. They'll get walk path metrics to help stores optimize their browsing. Shit, they'll probably come up with entirely new metrics that we're all too autistic to even predict right now. Advertising was already one of Amazon's fastest growing market segments, and now they're about to have some of the highest quality product data possible.

DD,Why thinking $DIS will close their US Parks is BAD DD,94,fg0pzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0pzb/why_thinking_dis_will_close_their_us_parks_is_bad/,138,1583812651.0,"So, after reading constant idiots talking about how Disney will close their parks, I need to tell you all how you are completely wrong and here is why.

&#x200B;

Disney parks that are currently closed:

Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong

Disney parks that are currently open:

Disneyland, WDW, Paris.

&#x200B;

What are the main difference between those parks? Disney ownership. Disney is NOT a majority holder in the asian parks. They recently got 100% ownership of Paris. One major thing that might change Paris is that the government might force them to close. It does not make that much money anyways. The US government will NOT force Disney to close their doors.

So what happens? If a restaurant worker gets the corona, they will close the restaurant for 2 weeks, deep clean, force workers 2 weeks off at worse, then continue. They will NOT close the whole park down. Does anyone remember the measles outbreak at Disneyland? They didnt do shit. Also, the main issue is that Disneyland and WDW has around 10+ unions. Disney workers have to live in cars because they do not make enough money. The union lawsuits with Disney voluntarily closing will be massive.

Does that mean they will not close? It is possible, but not as much as you retards are thinking. **The only way they will close is if California and Florida forces them to close.** With how much power Disney has against them, they will not take any of those actions. Disney owns Anaheim and Orlando. They can do what they want.

What about the crowd levels? I am guessing most of you dont live in California and dont have annual passes. I went yesterday, and that shit is still packed. You know why? Because 60% of attendance in Disneyland is pass holders. And do you know what pass holders love? It is when tourist attendance is down. All of the tourist attendance is being replaced by pass holder attendance. If you are really banking on Disneyland closing, you all should do some research and download the Disneyland app and watch the wait times. Radiator Springs is currently 75 minute wait and Space Mountain is  60. They ran out of Rise of the Resistance boarding passes today at 8:15am today.

Do I think you should stop buying $DIS puts? No. I think they still will go down. But people who are BETTING on Disney closing US parks are the people that should rethink their methods. I have been a cast member for 10 years and attendance is rising every year. They increase their prices to keep people away but people keep coming. Their Hotels though are at an all time low at this point, so tourists are cancelling their vacations. But for Disneyland, they make more money from annual passholders at this point.

&#x200B;

Edit: Ownership breakdown

Hong Kong - 53% HK Gov - 47% Disney

Shanghai - 57% China, 43% Disney

Tokyo - 100% Japan (Disney licensed)

&#x200B;

Edit 2: For you retards that cant read, this isnt a DD about if your calls or puts are going to print. This DD is solely on the fact that people are basing a lot of their $DIS puts on Disneyland and WDW closing. I dont care if you have DIS puts that are printing. I never said they wouldnt. I actually said it will but know you autists cants read more than a paragraph without a strike and exp date anyways.

Edit 3: Looks like a State wide guidance might close Disney! Gov announced guidance for banning gatherings over 250. Like I said in my original post, California banning gatherings was the wild card! https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/11/california-public-health-experts-mass-gatherings-should-be-postponed-or-canceled-statewide-to-slow-the-spread-of-covid-19/

DD,"$VIRT DD, Big Brain, Shit is about to MOON.",178,fg0hqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0hqd/virt_dd_big_brain_shit_is_about_to_moon/,172,1583811813.0,"Alright boys, here is a moon shot DD on $VIRT.

**TLDR: Buys $VIRT calls for 04/17 @ 30 and @ 35.** They are cheap as chips now but they won't be for long. This shit is about to moon.

1. Virtu is a market maker. They thrive in periods of market volatility. They reached their all-time high in 04/2018 @ 37. They broke out from $12 in 01/2018 to $28 in 02/2018 and then $37 in 04/18. Almost 3x their price in a 2-3 month stretch.

What was SPY doing from 01-04/2018? It was fucking tanking. It was a period of incredibly volatile. Comparing the SPY 500 to $VIRT reveals that periods of volatility, and especially downward direction of the SPY, resulted in $VIRT breaking out.

$VIRT appears to inverse SPY when it comes to dramatic movements. When SPY goes down, VIRT goes up.

Thanks to @Babywhalenuke here is the comparison between SPY and VIRT 

https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SPY,VIRT&utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


2) This is confirmed almost to the dot when we compare $VIRT to the VIX. **Guess when the last time the VIX spiked at the levels we are seeing now? 02/2018. The current market looks like a fucking cake walk in comparison to 2018. $VIRT Is going to moon.**

&#x200B;

[VIX chart, look at the beginning of 2018](https://preview.redd.it/vnvizdfs9pl41.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2cfb5615bd317ab538b889f336c4ce9030b2062)

3) $VIRT has a tendency to revise guidance early. ***They have already upped their guidance for the first two months of 2020 on 03/05/2020 and I full expect them to revise it up again in the beginning of April.***

**$VIRT thrives in period of volatility, this is the time to buy before it goes ape-shit when they revise their earnings.  Buy calls on $VIRT 04/17 @ 30 and @ 35.**

Let's get them tendies.

EDIT: Positions are 10 contracts at @30 for 04/17 and then 15 @ 35. Will post proof for you retards, if you want it.

EDIT # 2: Stay strong boys, someone posted a really good TA on VIRT yesterday and I think he is spot on. It is going to consolidate like it did today and maybe for another day and then it will hit the next leg up which is around 29-30. 

Also I just found out that the CEO will be announcing profits and losses at the end of every month. So that is the event I am trying to capture because we already know they revised their revenue for Jan-Feb up a ton on 03/04/2020. So expect the same thing for March, probably going to be posted at the beginning of April. 

Here is what the company said. From the CFO ""In the next few months, we will start publishing monthly data to provide you, the investors, a view into our monthly market making activity and we will plan to include notes about key developments in our business with these releases.""

^^^^thats the event I am trying to capture with the 04/17 calls. Their numbers for March will be off the fucking charts.",2020-03-09 23:43:33

DD,Time to short Pharma as well?,28,ffycfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffycfp/time_to_short_pharma_as_well/,20,1583804013.0,"It's been a long time since I've been on WSB and regardless of half the people here is from r/all I still wanted to post some DD I just heard. Co-worker went to a conference recently about someone receiving a grant from Bill and Melinda Gate's Foundation to produce medication in the US. Apparently the speech derailed a bit talking about how most medicines are produced in China because of the raw materials there and because of the Coronavirus, this could cause shortages. Apparently this has already been causing a shortage for some drugs but it can get far worse, real fast. 

I did some digging and already saw some articles talking about this, but it doesn't seem like it's anything that has fully caught media's attention.  For example:  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-slows-drug-production-in-china-the-worlds-pharmacy-11582900885](https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-slows-drug-production-in-china-the-worlds-pharmacy-11582900885)

At this rate, if production is remained at a halt, there's going to be multiple shortages and everyone is going to be shitting themselves and beervirus will be balls deep in pharmaceutical.

DD,Carnival Cruise Lines - Bankruptcy or Bounce?,49,ffy382,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffy382/carnival_cruise_lines_bankruptcy_or_bounce/,101,1583803079.0,"Alright, I think I found my next play: CCL, Carnival Cruise Lines. It's currently just a few dollars shy of it's financial crisis lows. You can sell an October $20 put for $6. If CCL is trading below $20 by October then you buy the shares at an effective cost basis of $14/share. Annual dividend right now is $2/share, though that will almost certainly get cut. Either way shares at $14 is literally 20th century prices.  


I think that even if the next few years are bad for the cruise line industry, unless there's a fundamental change in how Americans recreate, the cruise lines should come back. Boomers are retiring and they go on cruises, there are more boomers (around the world, not just USA) than any other demographic in the world, and while they are no longer in their peak spending years, they sure as shit are in their peak cruising years.  


Here are the 4 ways this play can go:  


1.) CCL recovers and trades above $20 by October. You make $600. (I think this is the most likely scenario)  


2.) CCL trades lower and is below $20 by October. You buy shares at a cost basis of $14/share.  


2a) After you buy shares, CCL continues to drop, declares bankruptcy, and goes out of business.  


2b) After you buy shares, CCL recovers, trades above $14/share, you make money on the dividend as well as on increasing share value.  


TL-DR; Sell Oct 2020 $20 CCL puts for $6.",2020-03-09 21:17:59

If you don't know Activision-Blizzard is responsible for creating Call of Duty, Overwatch, and a few other games.  They're one of the biggest gaming companies in the world.  They are also the biggest player in the E-Sports movement, as they own MLG, and are starting their Call of Duty: Modern Warfare E-Sports League soon, that just got even more sponsors.  They've been hit by corona virus, but not nearly as much as the general stock market, and I believe they should actually have gone up because of the virus.  The only reason that they are lagging behind is because of digital art creation, with around \~50% internationally taking place in China, and they've already started sourcing from other places.

&#x200B;

**China is the biggest consumer of Video Games, with annual revenue of \~$34 Billion**.  For the same reason that Netflix is up because of the virus, Activision should be up too.  People are quarantined to their houses internationally, left with digital content as their only source of entertainment in their life.  Before the crash, Activision was sitting comfortably at $64, now it's at $58 and there's no logical reason for it to be.  People just got scared that it would follow the general stock market.  The average analyst price target is $68, $10 above where its at this very moment.  Because of this strange oppurtunity, my bet, which I believe to be safe and extremely profitable is

&#x200B;

**Buy ATVI $60 Call 5/15 Expiration**

&#x200B;

This will guarantee profit, as it is after the EPS, when people will realize the virus was actually good for Activision.

&#x200B;

**Activision is currently way undervalued because of the virus fear, while it should actually be up.  This is the best buying oppurtunity to capitalize on I have ever seen.  You can check my history, I have been right about a lot of things.  I made $1700 off of an $770 Call on Apple Before The 9% boom.  I predicted the recent 2 day crash.  Trust me on this one.**

PUTS on ($MAR, $WH, $HLT, $PK) (03/20 - 04/~) expiration. The focus has been on casinos, not hotels, until now.** (***easy difficulty***)
-

**Alright establishing credibility** (***HARD difficulty***): 

I work with large companies, events, entertainment and HEAR a lot from idiot employees OF said companies. **I'm not stating I have information that is unknown to the public. I just know how these events work. The safety and government interaction behinds these events is insane and you don't even see it.**

 I pushed the LYV put and AMD dd's if you remember me. 

**The presentation of the main argument (*IMPOSSIBLE*)**:

If you like a sense of confidence with your investments; this ones for you. 
People were saying ""short hotel stocks: MGM, LVS."". They were focusing on the fact of tourism and gambling being impacted. Nobody was focused on the actual hotel industry. The revenue for these major Vegas hotels mostly comes from gambling, different from everywhere else. Hotels actually get their majority room nights booking from events. Make the connection? Everything is getting cancelled. 

I need to give a quick lesson about cities and how event centers work with them (you can probably skip this paragraph but it helps). Most convention centers operate at a loss, and that's the plan. City's work directly with event centers to attract events. These events drive economic growth for the city. Convention centers receive a large portion of their operating costs from the cities board. The cycle is government > the CC > hotels and continue with hotel tax to the city to repeat (think room nights). 

**tiny tldr; ($convention revenue > $hotels > $government) and it's cycles. purpose; economic growth.**

Here's where it gets interesting. Business to Leisure travel is a 1:2.1 ratio on average. Where do hotels get most of their revenue? Rooms right? Yes but, not by a long shot. By a small margin close to rooms is Food and Beverage **(F&B)** revenue. Not from room service, from events. Think catering and cooperate events. Cooperate event's are getting cancelled left and right. Add up this F&B revenue/business revenue and you have? A majority of hotel revenue is about to disappear. (Seriously catered event's are insanely expensive; ($40 a plate for steaks x 700 guests).

**tiny tldr; (hotel revenue = events (by majority) = cancelled)**

**Now this is where it gets really f****** **juicy.** A majority of these are combined. A Marriott for example hosts convention space (THE 3RD LARGEST REVENUE GENERATOR). RIP to their incomes. 

What hotels will get the most F****** in order (personal opinion based off operations and support):

1. Hyatt
2. Wyndham
3. Marriott
4. Hilton

other than puts, what about calls? some stocks are going up even when the markets are down. other than the virus related medical/pharmaceutical stocks, i think quarantine. what kind of businesses will benefit when people don't go out?

i am guessing grocery and food delivery stocks, e.g., KR, SFM, GRUB, etc. why?

1, people have to eat. all those chinese and italian restaurants are all going out of business? or can we just grubhub it? 

2, grocery (and food) delivery is a trend even before there is the virus. there is the instacart which is not publicly traded, and then the grocery stores are doing it themselves, like kroger and sprouts farmers market.

3, these stocks still have cheap calls because people are not talking quarantine yet.

4, didn't buffet just buy stakes in kroger? kroger is still making ATH's.

Bad news though, most of the obscure picks here are DOWN, not up.... so maybe I should throw the whole DD away**

While everyone is looking at puts, there are few opportunities for calls on companies that could help cure this virus. There are (at least) 3 obvious companies to buy calls on -- companies producing tests, vaccines, cures. Here's a list of the ones I can remember easily (in order of confidence/recent price moves):

Tests:

- OPK
- AIM
- CODX
- DGX
- TMO
- ILMN
- HOLX
- VIVO


Vaccines:

- INO
- MRNA
- GILD
- JNJ

Cure:

- SPEX
- REGN
- VIR
- ABBV
- TAK

Obviously, the holy grail is the cure, but it would be foolish to put all your hope there.

All that's well and good, but here's the real juicy bit. There's a story circulating on Reddit right now (Hi chinese overlords?) [about a university in xiamen creating a 29 minute test](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shine.cn%2Fnews%2Fnation%2F2003073683%2F). Some more searching has revealed that this tech *might* be the exact same that has been in use [in Israel](https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-company-develops-rapid-diagnostic-kit-for-covid-19/) ([short reddit discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ffpjn3/xiamen_university_steals_coronavirus_testing_idea/)). I'm too dumb to find an entity that I can buy calls on related to these but let's keep going -- because the closest I'm finding is SPEX. The [patent that SPEX executed an option on](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10434116) suggests that it is a *cure* that is based on previous SARS + MERS progress. Here's the TL;DR:

> The present invention provides methods for treating a coronavirus infection. For example, treatment may be effected by administering a neurotransmitter inhibitor, a signaling kinase inhibitor, an estrogen receptor inhibitor, a DNA metabolism inhibitor or an anti-parasitic agent. Also provided are methods for treating a coronavirus infection in which an anti-viral drug also is administered during any of the described methods.

The patent is somewhat vague (and I don't understand all of it) but it works with a few steps:

- administer a neurotransmitter inhibitor (chlorpromazine hydrochloride, triflupromazine hydrochloride, clomipramine hydrochloride, thiethylperazine maleate, chlorphenoxamine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride, fluphenazine hydrochloride, thiothixene, fluspirilene, and benztropine mesylate)
- administer a kinase signaling inhibitor (imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), nilotinib (Tasigna), and dasatinib)
- administer a estrogen receptor inhibitor/anti-parasitic agent/dna metabolism inhibitor (gemcitabine hydrochloride)
- administer an antiviral *during* the methods above (interferon, ribavirin, adefovir, tenofovir, acyclovir, brivudin, cidofovir, fomivirsen, foscarnet, ganciclovir, penciclovir, amantadine, rimantadine and zanamivir)

The way they are testing for it is that they administer 290 compounds, 33 of which activate when MERS, 102 activate for SARS, and 28 that activate when both MERS *or* SARS are present (the math doesn't add up, so not sure if a bunch of the compounds just don't activate consistently or if I misread). Read the patent for more, but basically, this cure is a mix of approaches effective on SARS/MERS.

Now the question is, what company sells these? Because they're about to get a lot of orders:

- <x> hydrochlorides lead me to [promethazine hydrochloride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promethazine) because it sounded familiar, and IMO it's way more widely available than the other stuff -- But all I can find are companies that *stopped* selling it -- Allergan (AGN)
- gemcitabine hydrochloride (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=overview.process&ApplNo=020509) - LILLY
- imatnib (https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&query=Imatinib) -- lots of companies, but the only one I recognize is Novartis, and Mylan
- antivirals (got lazy at this point) -- https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/26/5-biotech-stocks-to-watch-with-the-coronavirus-sca.aspx (lists the ones we already know, INO, MRNA, NOVAVAX, GILD, NVAX)

**AND HERE IS WHERE THE D GOES SOFT**

Unfortunately, all of the more obscure plays are *slightly red* right now -- I don't know if I'm ahead, or if none of this actually means anything. If anyone is a biologist/researcher in here, please help out because I spend my time touching keyboards, not pipettes. Specifically:

- There have to be massive amounts of companies I'm missing, please help if you know any more (even ones I've just left out here).
- Am I right on the idea?
- Which companies specialize in DNA testing? The tests that Israel is doing (and supposedly xiamen just started doing) are DNA based -- I can't tell if this is the same -- but it [looks like they are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction) -- calls should maybe be also going on the biggest companies that do this kind of testing (TMO, CODX, ILMN)

I am not your financial advisor, do with this information what you wish -- do your own research and please report back if you see anything juicy.

[EDIT] - Added HOLX (thanks /u/fanofpotatoes)

[EDIT] - Added ABBV (thanks /u/tooch_my_gooch)

[EDIT] - /u/IWasRightOnce with the context on INO:

> This thing is dead on arrival and this company does this every few years with literally every new disease/virus. 
> They pump up their share price by announcing a vaccine, then they do stock offering to raise cash

Be ye warned -- I'm in stocks so I can afford to wait out another pump, but maybe don't buy some short expiry weekly calls on INO.

Here are some positions that I'm holding right now that are fairly liquid (there's a range), decent premiums (at least when I bought them) and are based on different ideas so some of them may still pay tendies in different market conditions:

&#x200B;

(Alphabetical Order)

&#x200B;

ACWI (All Country World Index) - Seems like the entire world economy is being effected right now

&#x200B;

BAC - This one might be too late. Mine has a September expiry. I bought this one because of all the shit going down with corporate debt bubbles and the repo market shenanigans

&#x200B;

BBVA - Cheap international bank failure exposure

&#x200B;

BK - Honestly bought this one because it was cheap and because the put / call ratio was huge so some institution that knows way more than me figured out a reason to buy puts on it

&#x200B;

DIA - Sometimes cheaper alternative to SPY worth keeping an eye on and obviously still quite liquid

&#x200B;

DIS - This sub has covered this one fairly extensively

&#x200B;

EEM - See ACWI + emerging markets have worse healthcare systems

&#x200B;

EFA - Great exposure to parts of the world heavily effected by beer virus

&#x200B;

EMB - See EEM + repo posts on this sub

&#x200B;

EPI - India's fucked

&#x200B;

ERI - Casinos are fucked

&#x200B;

EWG - Germany's fucked

&#x200B;

EWI - Italy's fucked

&#x200B;

EZU - Eurozone's fucked

&#x200B;

F - Saw a post of r/Coronavirus about how fucked Europe is and how bad car sales are going to be

&#x200B;

FUN - Theme parks are fucked

&#x200B;

HYG - The highest put / call ratio on the stock market. I'm guessing something to do with BBB shit getting downgraded to Junk and everything else getting downgraded further. Hundreds of thousands of puts on this thing so obviously someone way smarter than me knows something.

&#x200B;

INDA - India's fucked

&#x200B;

KRE - Financial sector's fucked

&#x200B;

LQD - As investment grade bonds get downgraded this fund may struggle to find shit to buy. Also people are beginning to realize the shit that's in it right now is garbage

&#x200B;

LVS - Casinos are fucked

&#x200B;

LYV - Concerts are fucked

&#x200B;

MAT - BRUTAL financials. Imagine going down on a day where the market was up 5%

&#x200B;

PSP - Another one with TONS of puts on it. My best guess is with the impending recession the thesis is that the firms within these funds have some bad assets on their books

&#x200B;

QQQ - Pretty normal to see this here but thought I would include it regardless

&#x200B;

SPCE - Obvious reasons. Got into this one a couple weeks ago. As the market goes down this should go down twice as much. Premiums might be too high at this point.

&#x200B;

SQQQ - Just buy some SQQQ shares on up days if you think it will go down the next day

&#x200B;

TRIP - Travel's fucked

&#x200B;

UBER - Self explanatory I think

&#x200B;

UCO - Buy puts on this one if you think oil will go down. Buy shares or calls if you think it will go up

&#x200B;

VNQ - Super high put/call ratio. I think the MM's think real estate is fucked.

&#x200B;

WMT - I'm not sure on this one but it feels like it hadn't really seen much downside when I bought it

&#x200B;

XIC.TO - High put/call ratio, low premiums, seems to follow SPY fairly closely

&#x200B;

XIU.TO - See XIC

&#x200B;

XLF - Financial Sector's fucked between low interest rates and repo bullshit

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Expiry dates range from April to June with a couple Septembers. I may have been better off just buying SPY puts but I've always been one to try and think outside the box. I'm by no means an expert at this so please do your own research before buying puts on any of these.

Please let me know what you autists think and if you have any plays that you like that you think we should consider!",2020-03-11 07:30:56
DD,Possible $SQ short opportunity.,30,fgql2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgql2y/possible_sq_short_opportunity/,49,1583925344.0,"For those of you that don't know, Square Inc. is a merchant service and mobile payments company whose primary client base are small businesses.

Now, according to their 10-K, around **75%** of their revenue is from transactions, where they skim around 2-4 percent of the transaction. they also have hardware sales, but their second biggest line of revenue is from their business management subscription services that small businesses use.

Now here's the thing; Square's share price has dropped significantly during the beer virus outbreak ($85 - $67), but is still significantly higher than its late 2019 average price. Its most recent drop follows directly after a quick run up starting around 2 months ago. That means SQ's price still reflects its guidance of pre 2019 Q4 earnings release, which is the key to my thesis.

Experts say that we'll have a major Italy level pandemic in **10 days**. Besides the systematic risk that will 🏳️‍🌈🐻 fuck Square's valuation, there will also be mass quarantines and complete shutdown of cities. That means people won't be spending money at small businesses and brick n mortar stores, which means small businesses will not be generating sales and Square will not be generating transaction revenue. In addition, the average small business owner has almost **$200,000** worth of debt, debt that will no longer be able to be paid off due to lack of consumer level economic activity, and many small businesses will be forced into bankruptcy and go out of business.

So $SQ has a double whammy coming in. It will lose revenues for at least 2-3 months, and will lose a significant amount of its subscription revenue due to the closing of thousands of small businesses across the US.

We learned this in the Independence Day movie.

Recently, thanks to twitter, I found out that Nicotine can *potentially* prevent a Cytokine Storm.  A wut? It's the bad thing that happens to your body after you get Corona Virus.

Basically your immune system sucks, so it goes into a full-blown attack which causes your lungs to fill with liquid and you die (ARDS). Google ARDS. 

Why nicotine?

Because nicotine stops your immune system from working properly by inhibiting LPS-induced cytokine production. Scientists think that this is why smokers don't have Asthma, even though they should.  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992678

You're fucking dumb. Yes, I am. But, I am an internet sleuth and I've found some crazy shit that backs this idea up like this 1996 study:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8930570
""Eleven healthy male non-smokers were included in this study. The volunteers applied nicotine patches with a regulated release of 5 mg (day 1 and 2), 10 mg (day 3 and 4) and 15 mg (day 5, 6 and 7) nicotine per day.""  
""RESULTS:
Treatment with nicotine caused a significant inhibition of IL-10 production by NAC. In contrast, nicotine patch treatment had no effect on the production of IL-2 and TNF alpha.

CONCLUSIONS:
Nicotine in vivo has an inhibitory effect on TH2 cell function as measured by inhibition of IL-10 production, but does not appear to have any effect on TH1 cell function.""  
IL-10 = cytokine

Nicotine fucks the cyotkine production up and the nicotine patch is the perfect delivery system.

Seems like people smarter than me looked into this before for H1N1 Flu Virus:
‪https://www.sott.net/article/237552-Nicotine-is-an-Anti-inflammatory-Cure-for-H1N1-Flu-Virus‬

""Nicotine, although one of the most addictive chemicals, can have beneficial effects on inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, asthma, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases and perhaps, H1N1.""
which found...
""Ricin-treated mice can be protected by nicotine prior or after the cytokine storm begins.""


‪Ebola Zmapp treatment that was credited with saving 5/7 patients made with “tobacco species”‬

‪https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946569/‬




https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Nicotine_It_may_have_a_good_side

Harvard:
""Nicotine binds to the nerve cell receptors known as nicotinic or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Depending on the receptor and other factors, that binding may speed up the signaling between nerve cells or slow it down. There are at least a dozen nicotinic receptors; their functions are varied and overlap but often involve the processing of thoughts.""


https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-016-0725-1

""
Results
Nicotine treatment dose dependently limits the production of critical proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 (60.5 ± 3.3, %inhibition), IL-1β (42.4 ± 1.7, %inhibition), and TNF-α (68.9 ± 7.7, %inhibition) by activated human astrocytes. Interestingly, it also inhibits IL-8 chemokine (31.4 ± 8.5, %inhibition), IL-13 (34.243 ± 4.9, %inhibition), and butyrylcholinesterase (20.8 ± 2.8, %inhibition) production at 100 μM. ""
Now, I'm not a doctor, not a researcher, not a scientist. I don't even know what the fuck the above means. Just putting it out there on the odd fucking weird chance that nicotine patches somehow stop the beer flu. 

DISCLAIMER: Not a medical professional. This is NOT medical advice. Smoking will kill you, we're talking about nicotine patches here. Just trying to think outside the box to inspire peeps that there are different ways of solving a fucking problem than just watching it on the news. If you're dying anyways, and the nicotine patch is your last hope, doesn't seem like it would do much harm to give it a shot. $GSK makes the patches",2020-03-11 04:05:48
DD,Disney is severely undervalued,64,fgnvd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgnvd6/disney_is_severely_undervalued/,136,1583913793.0,"Alright, so I know this place has turned into a gay bear orgy over the past few weeks, but I'm here to tell the straights and bulls who are just experimenting in college how to make some serious tendies without feeling dirty.

Currently, Disney is trading below 110, putting it at the same levels as it was in late March of 2019. So right off the bat, its priced at the same level as it was before several very important factors were priced in:

1. The Disney-Fox merger being approved.

2.  Disney+ release and demonstrated success.

3. Galaxy Edge opening.

4. Increased stake in Hulu.

""But wait!"", I can hear you saying, ""They must be losing SO much revenue from their parks being closed!""

Yes and no. While parks are undoubtedly a big source of revenue for the company, in recent years, their media networks have edged them out as the top dog, while also being more profitable due to lower operating costs.   This is a trend which is likely to continue as their streaming services gain a greater foothold, and will more than make up for the steady decline of traditional tv services. 

Now, having established that parks are not actually the biggest moneymaker for the mouse, we will to figure out what exactly the impact to that revenue stream would be. Chinese parks have already begun reopening, and were closed for just the tail end of the Chinese New Year rush and the following month, which would have tapered off significantly in crowds anyway. We can project the same results to US parks and estimate about a months hit to park revenue, followed by a short slump and then normal operations. This means that March and most of April may be more or less out, but we can expect normal operations by June on. Peak Season.

So looking at perhaps a 10 percent disruption to operations of a revenue stream which only provides 24-26% of Disney total revenue, how much did the stock drop? Over 25 percent.

Now, when you consider how blue chip Disney is, and the short time frame we can apply to the disrupting effect, I expect to see a major rally for $DIS in the next 1-2 months, most likely correcting to the high 130s or low 140s as value investors realize how oversold it has become over corona fears. Buying calls in this range to the low 150s for late June through next year could result in serious tendies.

TLDR;  The mouse always gets his cheese. 7/17 $140 calls.

Edit: some good advice from a few other members. There will most likely be at leastone more big dip, so theres an opportunity to grab short puts for some quick cash, and then snap up long term calls even cheaper.",2020-03-11 04:03:13

- Perishable commodities and agricultural products are stacking up at our ports

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-10/battered-by-the-trade-war-ports-now-feel-brutal-virus-squeeze?srnd=premium

From the article:

“While the global economy is reeling from the spreading virus, seaports are a bellwether for trade because they handle a hefty 90% of all world shipping. The squeeze on ports like Los Angeles, the biggest in the U.S. for container traffic, illustrates the vast potential for economic harm from a virus-induced slowdown. Clothing, cars and an array of consumer goods from Asia are offloaded in Los Angeles and nearby Long Beach -- a crucial web that stitches together trucks, railroads, distribution centers and showrooms.

It all follows a bumpy couple of years for global commerce, which was dominated by supply-chain disruptions from the U.S-China trade war that eased this year with an initial deal.

“Alarm is the word,” said Jock O’Connell, a foreign trade consultant in California. “The demand for longshore labor has been down, but the real victims are the truck drivers who get paid by the load and the warehouse workers, who process goods.”

I previously posted this DD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffdrz0/covid\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffdrz0/covid_dd/)

It had some good stuff in it, and was well received, but sadly by the time anybody got around to making a trade, the sToNk market took the biggest beating since '08, and IV spiked so you can't even get in at an affordable price right now.

We all know (or you should fucking know) that in the trading game the rule is ""buy the rumor, sell the news"". I mean that's bloody obvious, this is why people insider trade FFS... So anyways, the game becomes ""predict the future"". Literally.

Anyways, as it stands our goal is to predict the headlines on CNN, MSNPC, FOX, BBC, etc. We know the reason for the crash on Monday was partially because of the quarantine in Italy and partially due to the oil war. I mean honestly, the oil war is not that big of a factor compared to the quarantine but you got a glimpse of the absolute state of panic that people go through when they realize ""holy shit this is real"". That's what bear gang thrives on, pure human emotion, and in particular the most powerful emotion there is -- fear.

So let's talk about what the headlines will be in 2 weeks from now. As it stands right now we're playing a game of denial and acceptance. I seen a chart on here, somebody link it below (was a top post I think like 2 weeks ago-ish) and it showed the 4 stages of the market under the beer virus. It was something to the effect of: Stage 1 small fears, media says it's all going to be okay stage 2 media starts talking about beer virus and something bad stage 3, media explodes people freak out, market crashes, stage 4 people accept and start to forget.

Anyways, so what will the headlines be in a few weeks? Well thank god we can do some maths... if you go to this website [\[1\]](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) it lists the beer virus by day. But in particular you can choose countries by day which.. is very helpful.

But first and foremost, Wuhan was quarantined around January 23rd [\[2\]](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/23/798789671/chinese-authorities-begin-quarantine-of-wuhan-city-as-coronavirus-cases-multiply) when approximately 830 were sick with the virus. The quarantine was extended to 50m people on January 28th [\[3\]](https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-officials-quarantine-entire-city-2020-1) when \~5,974 were sick.

Italy pulled the quarantine measure on 15m people on the 8th when 7,375 were sick [\[4\]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51787238), this was extended to the entire country the next day [\[5\]](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/09/813791575/italy-expands-quarantine-measures-nationwide-to-stem-spread-of-coronavirus) when 9,172 were sick.

So we can see that the panic starts to set in once a country manages to get shy of 10,000 infected. So what country is next? Now this is predicated on similar steps being taken... and it's a hard play for western countries to borderline shutdown their economies, but the precedent is set.

So how does this puppy evolve through time? Well, we can take a look at the natural log growth of it daily and we get this in Italy [\[6\]](https://imgur.com/a/OiPeQnL) (the only country with high numbers that I trust to give accurate data aside from second best Korea). So I decided well... how can you model exponential growth? Well there's a few models we can use... basic exponential growth N^((1+g)) or Ne^(rt) however those models don't fit so well to Italian infection rate growth [\[7\]](https://imgur.com/a/Byy9ZIJ). However, the ert model fits a bit nicer... however what if r could evolve through time? Well that's easy to do with a CIR process [\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%E2%80%93Ingersoll%E2%80%93Ross_model). All you need to do is match the historical growth rate of the disease and set a steady state. Now... the problem is picking a steady state which I'll expand on more later on. Anyways I minimized the variance of the Model to the actual data and got this [\[9\]](https://imgur.com/a/BSwtx6L).

It's really not complex. Basically the growth of the virus can be expressed as \~Ne^(rt) where r is the growth rate and t is the days and N is the cumulative number of sick persons. To really get autistic you could remove those who recover and all that but I'm lazy and my math fits somewhat nicely and the CIR kind of accounts for that so fuck off. Anyways we get this [\[10\]](https://imgur.com/a/fJlu10o). Which basically means we've got a model that can somewhat predict the future growth of this in other countries like France, Germany and the United States (you know, the places that actually affect the stock market).

**Conclusion:**

*Again I know half you retards skipped to here...*

**TLDR:** If you're from r/all buy calls on $WYNN March 13th $165 strike, cannot go tits up.

Here's what we're looking at for **Italy** over the next month for beer virus cases: [\[11\]](https://imgur.com/a/LnKn2aW)

**France** I back-tested the Italy growth and we got a pretty damn close fit [\[12\]](https://imgur.com/a/geMbupB). So I extrapolated the Italian numbers and super-imposed it onto France then forecasted using the model and got this [\[13\]](https://imgur.com/a/8DtzolY). You'll notice the range is massive, this is because France is basically a week and a bit before Italy in its outbreak. the long-run growth of the virus depends on a lot of factors, if France acts quickly then it'll be a lower theta value and it'll slow the spread. Regardless if it spreads fast (0.2, 0.15 and 0.1 theta) we'll see the number surpass 10,000 by March 18th. Else March 19th 0.05 theta or March 20th 0 theta. I would expect quarantines to ensue around those times if they correlate whatsoever with the actions of Italy and China, but we'll see...

**Spain and Germany** should behave the same-ish with a few days of lag...

Lastly, the USA I start the model from the starting data from n=\~70 like with France and Italy and build the model out, I get this interpolating the data over which matches pretty closely but I have to lagg it slightly (makes sense because other countries start to take precautions) [\[14\]](https://imgur.com/a/MovjIB3).

The forecast for **USA** looks like this [\[15\]](https://imgur.com/a/ukYbE2E). So I'd be willing to bet this thing stays more around the 0.2 theta spread but we'll see... quarantine measures will crank this down. Anyways, if this continues on track in the USA under current conditions with 0.2theta we'll surpass 10,000 cases by March 21st, if it has a lower theta drift of 0.15 then well see 10,000 cases by the 24th if 0.1 theta drift then \~march 28th/29th else with 0.05 we'll see \~April 5th for the 10,000th case.

**In closing,** I would bet on there being more quarantines of cities around the corner. Expect schools to shut down and don't forget puts on old folks homes/care taking facilities. Personally my bet. The markets will probably trade in circles until next week and then expect another big drop after the next country announces a quarantine of some major city. This is all predicated on whether or not the other G8 countries start following suit. If they do, bear gang wins.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** A few of you wanted a tickers and strikes, here's my thoughts:

$WELL looks well factored in... IV is stupid so you know what that means... down 30.6% from 52wk high

$VTR is the same.... well factored in; down 41.7% from 52wk high

$OHI looks somewhat factored in... -22.5% from 52 week high but IV on the long dated ATM puts are like .49 so yeah fuck that...

*In Canada I found these piles of shit which are not factored in IMO:*

$CSH.UN \[Canada\] (Chartwell Retirement Residence); it's only down 15% from 52 week high and **all it takes is ONE person in one of their residence to get sick with bat soup fever and once it hits the media the fucking stock will CRATER**.

This sub and our influence on low-med cap stocks we care about reframes the outsize influence that any small pool of money can have given the asininely powerful tools that calls and puts are in coordination.

Right now there's 4 TRILLION in BBB bonds of which energy - oil/gas/shale/etc - comprises 11%, or 400 billion. 

This 400 billion is currently at risk of being downgraded to junk bonds by rating agencies ((if they will at all like mortgage CDOS in 08)) due to the crash in crude oil prices. US shale producers face falling cash balances, bankruptcy (and theyre already overleveraged) due to low prices putting the bonds at risks of defaults etc, causing downgrades. 

But that's not all. With falling stock prices from coronavirus and economic worries, corporate debt is also at risk of being downgraded as companies committed a bunch of debt to share buybacks for the past decade. Rating agencies see declining value of assets that pertain to the bonds. It is a high probability they downgrade the rest of the 4 trillion in BBB corp bonds. 

So what happens? 4 trillion dollars in BBB get pushed into the high yield market, adding to the 1 trillion already there. Interest rates spike on junk bonds, and pension funds puke as BBB bonds are no longer investment grade - only what pensions funds can buy (or higher).

Pension funds go bust because they cant find yield in higher grade bonds (thank the Fed). IPO companies like Uber and BYND and more go bust as they cant service their debt, potentially in the wake of a global recession. Rating downgrades shock credit markets.

Check this article from Jan:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/gm-warns-of-ongoing-challenges-in-china-as-sales-fall-15percent-in-2019.html)   


**Reason #2: Coronavirus in China and the US**  
Coronavirus has TANKED auto sales in China (over 80%). People aren't going out, people aren't buying cars. Unless you're getting a car from a Carvana machine, you're probably at a dealership shaking hands, which no one wants to do right now. China sales drop, which we can expect to see mirrored in the US as the virus spreads.   
 [https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/](https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2020/vehicle-sales-down-80-pct-in-china-due-to-coronavirus/)   


Manufacturing facilities are also slowed in China, and likely to be slowed in the US. This is not a job that can be done working from home, and the manufacturing process will suffer if people cannot go out to work in factories.  


**Reason #3: Looming Recession**  
With the possibility off a recession on the horizon, this is especially important to consider. Auto Manufacturing gets absolutely pummeled in recessions. Cars are simply not a luxury people can afford in troubling financial times. Also, GM has recently invested a TON of money trying to prove that it can compete in the EV market. If a downturn happens now, this could obliterate its chances of competing anytime in the near future.  


Take a look at the charts here from McKinsey on how auto manufacturing is susceptible and was hit in 2008:  [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/resilience-in-transport-and-logistics)

DD,Mortgages: one last hit for fiending bulls,29,fgh66o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgh66o/mortgages_one_last_hit_for_fiending_bulls/,16,1583888918.0,"For all the bulls wandering wsb and fiending for just one more hit, I'm here to share my last dime bag.


Let's start with what has happened recently:

* When stonks go down, bond prices go up and bond yields go down. Mortgage rates go down with bond yields because they compete for the same low-risk investors.
* When the Fed cuts rates, bond yields go down (usually). We’ve seen this happen so far and I believe we can expect it to continue with further cuts.
* [Refinance applications spiked 26% last week](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/mortgage-refi-applications-rise-26-with-further-gains-likely) and are expected to continue to increase as rates fall.


What could happen moving forward:

* The Fed will continue to cut rates; the idea that they may even go to 0 or negative is not unrealistic given that other developed countries crossed this line a long time ago and [Trump is already calling for it](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/486775-trump-ramps-up-pressure-on-fed-to-cut-rates). This would absolutely juice refi and purchase mortgages alike.
* Coronavirus spreads and kills a lot of boomers. Boomers own the most homes – [78% of those aged 65+ own homes vs. just 36.5% of those under 35](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/08/homeownership-by-age.html). All those boomer homes will be hitting the market, freeing up inventory at the same time as mortgage rates fall drastically. What this means is that all of those millennials who have been locked out of the market are suddenly looking at a realistic path to home ownership, and in some areas of the country, will probably be looking at a mortgage payment that is lower than their rent.
* Given this bullish scenario for mortgage lenders and boomers’ desperate search for a safe haven for their money, I think we may see an unusual scenario where the demand for safe investments (MBS) keep mortgage rates “high” relative to bond yields, leaving more room for profit for lenders, but low enough that they still look very attractive to potential homebuyers.
* If this all plays out, these stocks will be spiking even higher when investors flock to the few stonks that are going up in a falling market.


So what are the moves? I’m looking mainly at mortgage lenders, who originate the loan; mortgage servicers, who facilitate collection of payment; and auxiliary businesses like mortgage insurance and title/escrow providers.

* PFSI (lender): Zacks strong buy, trading at low P/E
* IMH (lender): Upcoming earnings March 20 I think could be a strong earnings beat based on refi surge
* MTG (mortgage insurance): Since everyone here works in fast food I will assume you’ve never bought a house and as an FYI, mortgage insurance is required on your mortgage when you put down less than 20%. Most buyers taking advantage of newly low rates to enter the market likely won’t have the cash to put down 20% and will need this insurance.
* OCN (servicer): CEO just bought a bunch of shares. Dirt cheap.
* FNF (title/escrow services): RSI looks good.

**TL;DR rates down, mortgages up. Boomers die, mortgages up. Buy 3/20 or 4/17 calls on stocks listed above.**

Be aware that some of these are relatively low volume but there aren’t that many publicly traded stocks in this sector that don’t also have exposure to broader banking, which I am bearish on.",2020-03-10 21:08:38

DD,$PTON DD Inside,26,fg9378,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg9378/pton_dd_inside/,55,1583847765.0,"While the bears have been making tendies, I have studied the bike & tread. $PTON DD below. Significant risk and lots of competition in the fitness and bike at home space with cheap alternatives, but I believe PTON is poised to go to the moon. 
  

**Subscriber Count:**

* Connected Fitness Subscribers ($39 per month): 712k 

* Digital Subscribers ($12.99 month): 109k 

* Projecting upwards of 930k Connected Fitness Subscribers by 6/30/2020 

* 2 million total users. Includes users on shared subscriptions, apartment users, etc. 


**Pricing:**

* Bike: $2,245 over 39 months. 0% interest. $58 per month. 

* Tread: $4,295 over 39 months. 0% interest. $111 per month. 

* All-In Cost: $39 membership + $58 bike = $97 total. $48.50 per person for a couple.  

* Competitor Pricing (SoulCycle/Flywheel): Approximately $25 per class, avg 2.5 times per week. Let’s assume $25 per class and 9 times a month. Single user cost = $225. Your wife and her boyfriend cost = $450. 

* With the financing option, PTON looks relatively reasonably priced and any millennial making over $50k a year could afford this by simply boozing 1 less time a month and saving $100.  

  

**Financial Outlook:**

* $435MM revenues in FY 2018, $915MM in FY 2019, and FY 2020 expectations of $1.5Bn+. 

* $-122MM net income in FY 2019, losses will likely continue through FY 2021 as the Company ramps up the infrastructure.  I’d bet on a profitable quarter by end of 2021 or sometime in 2022. 

* Current recurring revenues based on subscriber counts annualize somewhere around $500MM and quickly growing. This is where the real money is made, it’s not just a piece of equipment but a recurring subscription just like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, etc. 

* Margins should significantly improve as subscribers increase. Current subscription margins are ~60%.  

 
**Subscriber Retention:** 

Relatively low churn rate and sticky membership. No one wants to cancel a membership after they already purchased a bike for $2k. The brand is strong with 30+ live trainers that users feel a connection with. All data and ride history is stored and you can share and compete with friends. Changing bike platforms ultimately becomes a bit more of an inconvenience for this reason.  


**Competition:** 

PTON recently settled a lawsuit with Flywheel in which Flywheel admitted to copying parts of PTON’s technology and leaderboards. Flywheel shut down its online classes and PTON even offered users to trade in their bikes for a free PTON bike.  


SoulCycle just announced an at-home bike with a retail price of $2,500. It looks like they will not offer live classes, and just on demand classes. I can’t see this posing a significant threat with the price range above the PTON bike and without live classes. 


**Market Conditions:**

The fitness and wellness market is massive and growing. Even with a small market share in the overall fitness market, a strong market share in the at-home cycling niche can be substantial. PTON has branded well and seems to fit right along with the BECKY lifestyle that I wouldn’t want to bet against.  

Not sure how ultimately significant the coronavirus impact will be, but with the scare going on that could last months, it’s reasonable to expect a slight uptick in sales/subscribers from consumers wanting to work out at home.  

 
**Positions:** 

Personally, have been loading up on shares as the premiums have sky-rocketed but here are the plays I’d make:  

* Short-term: $22 puts 3/27. Likely will trend downwards with the market until better news.

* Longer term: $30 calls 7/17. Feel very good about next earnings and overall market rebound.",2020-03-10 09:42:45

* **First Aid and Safety Services** ($0.6B) **-** fire extinguishers and testing, and safety and compliance training.

The company's 10-K also mentions major risk factors for their business including:

* ***Negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance*** *-* With the coronavirus major sporting and music events are being canceled meaning reduction in event staff and janitorial staff.

Not to mention other industries already affected that rely on their services such as airlines and cruise companies, 
* ***Changes in the fuel and energy industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations****. -* Reduced demand for US Shale oil due to the price war and travel restrictions/demand will result in a reduction of oil field and refinery workers who rely on flame retardant uniforms and related supplies that Cintas makes. Additionally less demand for oil field contractors will lessen the demand for their fire and safety compliance training divisions.

SIX currently has a debt to asset ratio of 1.25 (this is considered as highly levered as this means SIX currently does not have enough assets to cover their liabilities in full). Both Moodys and S&P have recently set forth a negative outlook on their bonds (S&P before coronavirus breakout) and they have notes due Jul 2024 (500M  4.875%) and Apr of 2027 (700m  5.5% ). Both of these bonds pay out bi-annual coupons at the rates mentions above.

Now anyone with a shred of common sense would look at these numbers by themselves and realize that a 80y/o lung cancer patient could breath and blow this shit over.  But wait! There is more.

SIX is also currently the target of a class action lawsuit for misleading shareholders. They basically lied about the progress they were making on their Chinese expansion and construction and stated that they expected to see "" weaker-than-anticipated quarterly revenue from its agreements with Riverside (the real estate dev company) in 2019 and 2020. 

Lets take a look at their company's profitability (or lack thereof) now.

Q1 2019: -0.86

Q2 2019: 0.94

Q3 2019: 2.11

Q4 2019: -0.13

Q1 2020 Guidance: -1.03

These are numbers you would expect to see from a company that is still growing and is eating up capital to fund that. Not a 59 y/o company with negligible revenue growth. At their growth levels they should be able to generate profit consistently.

This is a dogshit company that will go bankrupt once again like it did during the financial crisis (for very similar reasons mind you) and will be forced to sell locations.

They have a measly  174,179,000 in cash right now with   130,304,000 as their cost of revenue meaning  that they barely have enough cash to continue operations for a year.

IF SIX FLAGS IS FORCED TO SHUTTER LOCATIONS THEY WILL 100% DEFAULT ON BOND PAYMENTS. There is no world where they will use their minuscule amount of cash to pay coupons. TTM operating income is at  436,250,000 which I expect to either be negative or zero as they close locations because of closing locations. Earnings are Apr 21 which will without a doubt tank with perhaps some bad news lumped in with the earnings call.

Fully expect this company to be a penny stock by EOY and delisted and who the fuck goes to six flags to begin with.

Now I’m going to repost it here to prevent you guys from losing money and buying calls.

Remember this is a post from seven months ago, read it and buy your fucking puts, we’re going down. 

*This time around it seems like geo-political issues will be to blame. Isn’t this all very much preventable?

That’s the problem. Everyone is thinking this is just trade warz. It’s not. Trade issues don’t help, and they may have tipped things in the opposite direction, but they are not the primary thing causing these problems.
But just to inform you...

• The eurozone sovereign debt crisis of 2011/2012 was never solved. We just got negative interest rates and lots of liquidity injections by the ECB over the past 5 years which kicked the can down the road. Now they’re running out of ammo with almost the entire European bond market yielding negative... which is batshit insane.

• China’s credit bubble has expanded every year, while their GDP growth has been slowing down. I won’t go far into detail here since it can become its own large thread in itself, but China’s financial problems by themselves could send the world into a major depression in my opinion. I know that’s an extreme comment, I know I’m putting my neck out on a limb saying that, but I don’t see any other way around it if shit hits the fan there. China is directly affected by the trade war issues, but they were seeing financial strain before trade war issues ratcheted up the pressure.

• Brexit is still a thing, and the “worst case” no deal solutions that was once an afterthought is now becoming accepted as the most likely scenario.

• US assets are generally very expensive, with software and growth stocks doing their best to mimic dotcom era valuations. Meanwhile, a lot of hot money escaping Europe and Asia’s problems has flowed into the USA, which likely has played a big role in fueling these extraordinary valuations. Even “value” stocks have been rather expensive. Multiples have compressed some ever since the height of the 2018 blowoff top, but this is largely just a product of money sloshing into fixed 
income and safe havens more than anything else.

• This same flow issue is providing an extraordinary bid for anything providing yield, as foreign pension funds , insurance companies, and banks are starved for yielding assets considering they can’t purchase their own sovereign bonds for positive yield. This has forced foreign financial institutions way out the risk curve, and even with that in mind, they’re still not getting much back in terms of yield. Japanese, Taiwanese, and other foreign institutions are at severe risk if and when credit gets downgraded, or when currency starts to move against them  (which it likely has already started). I can’t state how much of a risk this is systematically.

• Sure, something like CLO’s by themselves aren’t an enormous issue, but when you realize that CLO’s are just one subset of the “anything producing yield” bubble (junk bonds, investment grade debt, em sovereign debt, etc), you start to see the bigger picture. The bond market blowup of Argentina recently is a good example of the risk some institutions may take pushing way out the risk curve in search for a small bit of extra yield. 
Thankfully, this wasn’t anything major and it’s not where most money is being placed, but it’s a small example of what can happen here.

• There is over 12 trillion dollars in emerging market debt denominated in USD, and the dollar just keeps rising. The more we see financial issues in Europe, Asia, etc, the more this just squeezes the US dollar higher, putting even more strain on the global financial system since it gets even more difficult to repay these USD-denominated debts. This is especially negative for all EM countries, and I’m not really sure what the long term solution is. There have been attempts to kick the can down the road, but most of those just involved more borrowing, which just made the problem worse in the long run.

So to summarize, we have systematic risk in China, Europe, and broader Asia, and then on to of that, we have highly stretched valuations in the USA. It all goes hand in hand, but trade wars may be the hammer that breaks this stretched system apart. FWIW, there is a LOT of nuance, a lot of other issues, and there are also some positives I’m not adding here since it’s not the point. But the main point worth making is that people should pull their heads out of their ass and quit paying attention to all the trade war garbage. It’s an issue, but it’s likely more the needle than the actual problem itself.*

So in the end coronavirus started the reckoning, buy puts. I suggest on EM indexes and banks. Also will be a matter of time before tech valuations start to drill. And watch the fucking USD, the higher it goes, the bigger the world gets fucked. The writing is on the wall my fellow autists, so one more time, buy your puts.",2020-03-12 03:51:27
DD,[DD] - Turned $5k to $165k in 3 Weeks. Here’s my grand finale ... Zillow ($Z) is done for.,1592,fh6u5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh6u5p/dd_turned_5k_to_165k_in_3_weeks_heres_my_grand/,520,1583999023.0,"I’ve [now made $165k in 3 weeks,](https://imgur.com/gallery/QFFIhEc) and this will be my coup de grace. 

Many of you have been [following along with my posts. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/feqfb9/dd_crash_incoming_real_talk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I appreciate the support and engagement. 

Here’s my final hurrah. I believe Zillow ($Z) is crashing here soon. I’m too tired for my typical TA novella, so here’s the quick and dirty. 

1) Their house flipping model was not designed to withstand an economic downturn, much less be profitable in a stable economy (they lose money on every flip)

2) Equity is way overvalued relative to peers or market. The 52 Week low ($29) was only 5 months ago, and it’s currently sitting over $40. Housing market about to get fucked, and Zillow holding the bag. 33% over recent bottom is absurd. The world is burning. 

3) In a recession, people will look to refi vs buy, and the market will stagnate. 

4) There’s some in depth TA that helps explain it if you go looking. 

I’ve taken roughly $80k off the table, and all in (with proof in first link) with the remaining ~$80k on 3/20 $45 Puts and 4/17 $40 Puts. When this dips under $30 I’ll flip for an additional gain over $200k. 

Been a fun and wild ride these last few weeks. Best of luck out there everyone... shit is crazy town!

DD,[Discussion/DD] $SNAP massively oversold?,63,fh58l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh58l3/discussiondd_snap_massively_oversold/,111,1583992762.0,"Yeah, yeah I know

""Snap sucks you retard why are you even bullish on it""

""who even uses that shit anymore, it's all Instagram nowadays""

""they aren't and will never be profitable you fucking autist""

I get the criticisms, I really do. And for the most part they do have some merit. Insta/FB is without a doubt the regning king of social media and Fuckerberg has the entire world licking on his giant social media nutsack as he ejaculates everyone's personal data into the mouths of advertisers everywhere. 

Now, let's pretend we have more than 3 brain cells for a minute here and try to think critically about what SNAP has to offer, both upside-wise and downside-wise


**Q4 2019 earnings**

A little over a month ago, SNAP announced their ER. The market was anticipating an earnings and revenue beat on that ER, finally declaring snap to be profitable after all this time. People were buying into it like crazy as we approached the ER and analysts kept raising their price targets over and over and over. 

Enter ER day. SNAP announces they actually managed to post positive record profits in EPS (more than tripling what the analysts were estimating). Amazing, this is what the market was waiting for! SNAP to the moon, right? FUCKIN NOPE. They also announced that they missed on revenue estimates by a roaring 0.2%. 

*0.2%*

**0.2%**

Doesn't sound so bad right? 

Well the market had other ideas and the stock dropped down almost 20% over the course of the following day. 

Surely this is an overreaction and its bound to recover right? Again, fucking NOPE. It's literally been in freefall all the way through to today as the market was force-fed spoonfuls of bad news in quick succession. It is still yet to recover any sort of steam as I write this on 3/11/2020 (SNAP closed today at 10.80, down 9.84% on the day and down 44% from its 52 week high of 19.25 on 01/23/2020 right before the ER)

First of all, let's address the 2 elephants in the room currently sticking their dicks in the market and what their impact would be on SNAP specifically:

1. Oil price war

Although Saudi crashing oil prices globally has a fairly huge negative effect on the market as a whole, if we analyze individual impact, this literally shouldn't affect SNAP in any way, shape or form. The entire world's supply of oil could run out today and SNAP as a company would remain totally unaffected. 

2. Coronavirus

Now this is where things get interesting for SNAP. The assumption people are making is that everything will be affected negatively by this virus, SNAP included. And for the vast majority of stocks, they would likely be right. Coronavirus is causing a huge supply shock, manufacturing delays, prohibiting people from going to work/school and all in all just causing a huge global economic slowdown. Not to mention its taking out the boomers who currently own the biggest % of the market and may easily decide to liquidate if they feel their life/money is threatened.

*However*, let's take a closer look at how this affects SNAP on its own, shall we? 



Is SNAP negatively impacted by the manufacturing slowdown or the supply shock that's hitting everything right now?

Nope, they don't manufacture shit and couldn't care less about supplies or imports/exports from any country



Is SNAP negatively impacted by the fact that people can't go to work/school for a few weeks and have to chill at home?

Nope, as a matter of fact, similarly to Netflix, they actually make more money when people don't have shit to do and are sitting at home scrolling through their phones or texting friends. You wanna know what else? 90% of kids in middle school/high school in the US currently use SNAP and most of them consider it their primary method of getting in contact with friends. Now, guess who's schools are about to get canceled and won't be allowed to go see their friends face to face for a while? Yep, you guessed it. SNAP's whole fucking userbase almost. Very soon a shitton of kids will have to stay at home instead of going to school or going out with friends, and they will resort to their main method of talking to their friends while that happens: SNAP.

Okay, so it's basically gonna be like Netflix where people use it a lot more just cause they're stuck at home right? So they should behave similarly through this whole thing?

No motherfucker, that's the best fucking part. We're diving headfirst into a recession right now. What do people do in a recession? They save money by cutting out services they pay for but don't necessarily need (i.e. Netflix). Well, guess what service finally figured out how to make money without the users paying anything? That's right, asshole. Mother fucking SNAPCHAT. That's makes it an even more reliable hold than NFLX right now despite what the market is pricing in

The sentiment around SNAP right now is oddly similar to how Tesla was being treated a little over a year ago when people were overselling it, shitting on it, and claiming it'll never post profit and will go bankrupt. That changes this year just like Tesla changed last year. Don't miss out on this opportunity to buy in while the getting is good or you may end up begrudgingly buying it at $25/share like some of you assholes who bought Tesla at 700. 

If you want additional DD and a more detailed look at their numbers lately, check this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbzix6/bought_snap_stock_friday_1379

/u/donnieisWiafu2 goes into what makes this such a solid buy in very good detail 

PS: for the most part this all applies applies to FB as well, but if we're talking about value investing, the value/price ratio I'm seeing in SNAP is much higher than that of FB atm. FB is currently almost 30x as big as SNAP marketcap-wise


TL;DR:- Long SNAP - Middle/high school/college kids all about to have their schools canceled and won't be able to interact with each other for a while except through social media mainly. Vast majority of these kids are addicted to SNAP and will cause it to post record profits and revenue next Q without a doubt (they already practically did last Q). This will cause SNAP to soar. Get in while it's being pummeled right now by an irrational market.


EDIT: OK noted, you cocksuckers only understand strike price and expirey. Buy LEAP calls for Jan 2021/2022 if you hate buying stocks or maybe like 12-14c that expire a couple months from now so it includes their next earnings report. I would highly recommend picking up a bunch of shares and holding for a couple years tho. You'll thank yourself and me later.

EDIT (4/21/2020): SNAP just announced their earnings and beat on revenue, jumping 20% after hours and closing at 14.99. Hope some of you guys actually listened to me and profited from this unlike most retards in this thread

EDIT (7/7/2020): After a huge 8% move up today SNAP is currently trading at 25.10. Sentiment around it seems to finally be turning bullish among analysts, media and WSB alike as anticipated. In fact, we might be too bullish in the short term now if I'm being honest. Earnings in 10 days will likely decide if the stock will break ATH and go crazy or consolidate back down. Hope this post convinced someone to pick up shares/leaps back then, should have profited handsomely over the last few months",2020-03-12 01:59:22

DD,ARMK - Sports Closures,34,fh4785,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh4785/armk_sports_closures/,57,1583988896.0,"While Aramark was down 14% today - this was prior to the news of March Madness being played in front of no fans. Additionally, we can expect more stadium / sporting closures due in the near feature. This company is sure to get rocked by the fall out. Food and Support Services represent 70% of revenues, company is operating at a net loss, and the balance sheet is weak with low cash and high debt.

*NOTE:* As mentioned by commenters, volume is extremely low so you will have to scan the options chain for reasonably priced options.

**Business Description:**

Aramark provides food, facilities, and uniform services to education, healthcare, business and industry, sports, leisure, and corrections clients in North America and internationally. It operates through three segments: Food and Support Services United States, Food and Support Services International, and Uniform and Career Apparel. The company offers managed services, including dining, catering, food service management, and convenience-oriented retail operations; non-clinical support services, such as patient food and nutrition, retail food, and procurement services; and plant operations and maintenance, custodial/housekeeping, energy management, grounds keeping, and capital project management services. It also provides on-site restaurants, catering, convenience stores, and executive dining services; beverage and vending services; and facility management services comprising landscaping, transportation, payment, and other facility consulting services relating to building operations. In addition, the company offers concessions, banquet, and catering services; retail services and merchandise sale, recreational, and lodging services; and facility management services at sports, entertainment, and recreational facilities. Further, the company offers correctional food, and food and facilities management services for parks; and operates commissaries, laundry facilities, and property rooms.

**Risk Factors - Directly From 10-K**

**Economic Downturn**

The portion of our food and support services business that provides services in public facilities such as convention centers and tourist and recreational attractions is particularly sensitive to an economic downturn, as expenditures to take vacations or hold or attend conventions are funded to a partial or total extent by discretionary income. A decrease in such discretionary income on the part of potential attendees at our clients' facilities has in the past resulted, and in the future could result, in a reduction in our revenue. Further, because our exposure to the ultimate consumer of what we provide is limited by our dependence on our clients to attract those consumers to their facilities and events, our ability to respond to such a reduction in attendance, and therefore our revenue, is limited. There are many factors that could reduce the numbers of events in a facility or attendance at an event, including labor disruptions involving sports leagues, poor performance by the teams playing in a facility, number of playoff games, inclement weather and adverse economic conditions which would adversely affect revenue and profits.

**Natural Disasters:**

Natural disasters, global calamities, political unrest, sports strikes and other adverse incidents could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Natural disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes, global calamities, such as an Ebola outbreak or a flu pandemic, or political unrest, such as the recent demonstrations in Chile, have, and in the future could, affect our revenue and operating results. In the past, we experienced lost and closed client locations, business disruptions and delays, the loss of inventory and other assets, asset impairments and the effect of the temporary conversion of a number of our client locations to provide food and shelter to those left homeless by storms. For example, our financial results were particularly impacted in 2018 by wildfires in and around Yosemite National Park and in 2017 by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the southern United States. In addition, any terrorist attacks, particularly against venues that we serve, and the national and global military, diplomatic and financial response to such attacks or other threats, also may adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Sports strikes, particularly those that persist for an extended time period, can reduce our revenue and have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Any decrease in the number of games played would mean a loss of revenue and reduced profits at the venues we service.

**TLDR:** The company provides food and support services to convention centers, conferences, and stadiums which accounts for 70% of revenues. The company has directly cited pandemics and economic downturns as risk factors in their 10-K, however, they have never experienced mass closures around the country of public events.

DD,Changing the Public Narrative & Promoting Consumer Confidence through GILD's Remdesivir,26,fh19sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh19sw/changing_the_public_narrative_promoting_consumer/,34,1583978102.0,"So, yeah, WHO just designated the spread of Covid-19 as a pandemic. My thought for this post was when I heard that a emergency meeting was called for all US health officials at the White House. Anyways, my DD on GILD and a scenario in which BULL returns:

The government has a chance to reinstate public confidence by fast-tracking Remdesivir (GILD's Covid-19 treatment, which you guys all know by now). Imagine having an effective treatment available if you fall into the mild/severe range after contracting Covid-19. Essentially, Covid-19 would be less of a threat than the flu, since we don't even have an effective treatment for this seasonal MF that kills tens of thousands here (US) every year. Instantly, public sentiment would shift and the markets would mainly have to consider only the supply-side effects of Covid-19 on the economy rather than demand-side repercussions. Since, we're already well priced in for the supply-side shock, allaying fears and resigning Covid-19 to the annals of scary-what-coulda-happened. Covid-19 would be like that fucked up relative who comes to visit once a year on the holidays, but just once a year, and is then promptly ushered to the airport or whatever shithole he/she came from. 

I am not a medical expert or know much about anything, so please take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. This is my first post, too, but I don't think that seems to matter too much (I've been lurking for about 8 months) on this sub since most of the posts seem like pump and dump shitposts anyways. I wish I was gifted with eloquence or a sense of charismatic voice, but alas, it was not to be, so read accordingly fellow autists.

**Initial Washington Patient**

GILD's Remdesivir drug \*seemed\* to have effectively treated a patient. I'm using \*\* because this is just one case and the medical community doesn't seem convinced whether the drug was effective or that the patient got well himself. An article about the Washington man who received the treatment is below:

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-01/coronavirus-case-treated-with-gilead-drug-may-spur-wider-tests](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-01/coronavirus-case-treated-with-gilead-drug-may-spur-wider-tests)

There was another post/article that I read previously (which I can't seem to easily find through Google) that detailed the progress of the patient on a daily basis. The post/article described the sudden deterioration off the patient's condition and requested compassionate use of Remdesivir. If anyone knows of or finds the article, I'd appreciate it if you could leave it in the comment section.

**Nebraska Patient & US Death Count**

The NIH stated that GILD would be providing Remdesivir to patient(s) in a Nebraska quarantine hospital facility. The press release was issued on February 25th, link below:

[https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-remdesivir-treat-covid-19-begins](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-remdesivir-treat-covid-19-begins)

To my knowledge, and the sites I frequent through Google search, there hasn't been any deaths related to the coronavirus so far in Nebraska (as of this post date: 03/11/2020), which gives credence that Remdesivir may be effective as a treatment (or that it did not affect the outcome), since we should have seen some deaths from the people who contracted the coronavirus earlier.

**China Phase 3 Clinical Trials/Experiment (?)**

You guys can Google this, since there doesn't seem to be a lack of articles covering this subject. Essentially, GILD is conducting experiments right now. If proven effective, I believe the FDA would fast-track this drug as treatment for Covid-19. The results of this experiment may come out anytime from later this month (there was an article a couple days ago from someone who claimed that initial results may be released earlier) to sometime in May. I read (without a link because I'm now too lazy to Google and find all these articles) that results should be out by early May since the clinical trials end in late April.

**Remdesivir as a Prophylactic Treatment Argument**

\*If\* Remdesivir is effective against Covid-19, then it may also be used as a prophylactic treatment (like a vaccine). The following article is mainly concerned about the financial windfall expectation of Remdesivir for GILD, but it also explains the possible use of Remdesivir if it is proven effective as a treatment to Cover-19 (so, expanded label type of argument).

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/will-gilead-sciences-make-a-fortune-off-its-corona.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/will-gilead-sciences-make-a-fortune-off-its-corona.aspx)

Remdesivir shows promise in clinical studies on mice with MERS:

[https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/12/1922083117](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/02/12/1922083117)

**Counter Argument -** 

**Washington Post Article on Remdesivir as a failed Ebola treatment**

The Washington Post article is behind a paywall, so I'm just leaving the title of the article:

""The Best Hope for Coronavirus Treatment is an Experimental Drug that Fizzled Against Ebola""

Essentially, the article states that Remdesivir is a broad anti-viral that was created to treat Ebola but was ineffective (if I recall correctly, the author used strong language to describe the inefficacy of Remdesivir, something like ""utterly failed""). The general takeaway seems to be along the lines of 'if this drug was not created for Covid-19 or for Coronavirus' specifically, can we really be hopeful that this drug will magically cure patients for which it was not created for?

**Upside Limit - Movement Limitations Observed**

The following link is the same as the one above regarding Remdesivir as a possible prophylactic treatment. In the articles he author brings up some Merrill Lynch guy who says the financial windfall won't be that big for GILD even if Remdesivir is proven effective.

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/will-gilead-sciences-make-a-fortune-off-its-corona.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/09/will-gilead-sciences-make-a-fortune-off-its-corona.aspx)

There are many articles regarding this subject, so, yeah, Google away.

Of course, Remdesivir could be shown to be an utter fail in treating Covid-19, but I don't believe so. Even WHO and our government are stating that it's our best chance.

**My Ending Thoughts & Conclusion**

In my opinion, GILD will be sitting on a gold mine if Remdesivir shows efficacy in treating Covid-19, not only because it would make money immediately by selling the drug to treat patients but also because nation-states would stockpile the fuck out of this drug, like they do for all other medical supplies. I'm not sure about the shelf-life for Remdesivir (I'm a fellow autist with no other specialty than creating walls of text and losing tendies), but I'm pretty sure many countries are going to constantly re-up like drug users every now and then. Additionally, if Remdesivir is proven effective as a prophylactic, then we all get to laugh maniacally while skipping to our bank.

Plus, SARS, MERS, and Beer Virus-like coronavirus' seem to pop-up every now and then, so we would all look to Remdesivir, if proven effective, first as the preferred/priority treatment. Tendies galore.

DD,Dollar General (DG) - 3/12/2020 Market Hours - Discount Retail Winner,21,fh0wqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fh0wqv/dollar_general_dg_3122020_market_hours_discount/,16,1583976727.0,"Stock: **Dollar General (DG) - 162.88$**

Direction: **Neutral**

**Price Target:** **160$**

**Type: Put Credit Spread, Iron Condor**

**Fundamental:** Dollar General is a superior discount retailer with great cashflow and constantly improving store metrics. It also has a dividend payout of 0.77% annually. Dollar General has mostly survived the coronavirus macro pull and is currently looking to beat both top and bottom line in upcoming earnings. While the discount retail sector has fared pretty well in current macro conditions, I doubt it’ll continue trending to ATH again.

**Technical**: Priced above 20DMA, below 50, 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 50, coming down slightly. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and neutral open interest. Implied movement is 5.2% or about 8.30$ Short interest is at 1.46%, with 3.9 days to cover. Support at 152$, with all time high being 167.44$

**Sentimental**: Dollar General’s main competitor, Dollar Tree, just had a subpar quarter performance-wise. However, in the last years of earnings, DLTR and DG did not have similar performances in earnings due to DG’s vastly superior store model and trade-war preparation. In addition, the coronavirus outbreak has largely left DG unscathed, while DLTR faced a similar selloff. However, given the current macro outlook, an Iron condor may be a good move, though much riskier. I expect DG to beat earnings and at least inline guidance.

They are NOT however, sending everybody home or closing the campuses bc quote, ""They are sanitizing the infected area.""  Covid about to spread through two major regional centers of two major financial services companies (Fidelity has moved a lot of regional leadership roles from around the country to their Dallas area campus and Schwab is in the same process).

Do with this what you will but literally just talked to friends who work for both companies and in both call centers and, again, neither call center is shutting anything down or doing anything serious to contain the spread.  They're basically saying, ""We discovered the infected and sent them home and that will stop it right there.""  They are also telling employees not to be concerned and they are unable to test more than a handful of employees.  


\*UPDATE\* So, Fidelity has spent the past few years giving many of their reps (most of them actually) work from home capabilities, this includes literally the service reps you talk to when you call the 800 number.  Schwab on the other hand, just sent out a memo asking ""PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE A DESKTOP COMPUTER AT HOME"" and are piloting a work from home program w/ literally ONE person... from what I know about Schwab's internal controls they have probably been scrambling to find and purchase some kind of work from home technology since this morning.",2020-03-11 18:38:56

***TECHNICAL ANALYSIS***

Thanks to u/catsmeow492 for doing some technical analysis. Based on his Technical Analysis it seems like the pattern is bullish.Chart : [https://imgur.com/gallery/LzndcWc](https://imgur.com/gallery/LzndcWc)If you would like to read the whole thing about TA then click on his post here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg2ch8/virt\_technical\_analysis\_bullish\_2993c\_522/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg2ch8/virt_technical_analysis_bullish_2993c_522/)

***ABOUT THE COMPANY***

***$VIRT*** goes up if the volume and volatility is high in the market. It seems like volume and volatility isn't gonna go down especially for the next couple of months. $VIRT appears to inverse SPY movements. When SPY goes up, VIRT goes down and vice versa.

Chart : [https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SPY,VIRT](https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SPY,VIRT)

***WHY VIRT WILL CONTINUE RISING***

Thanks to u/doctaO for doing a brief research on this Company. I'll try to summarize what he said :

**VIRT** made **$100MM - $105MM** in January, which is around **$5MM** per day in trading income. They also announced that February was about the same

**$VIRT** announced Preliminary results Year to Date through February on March 3.

**Adjusted Net Trading Income  between $230 and $240 million**

Average Daily Adjusted Net Trading Incomebetween **$5.75 and $6.00 million per day**

Source : [https://ir.virtu.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Virtu-Announces-Preliminary-Results-Year-To-Date-through-Feb-2020/default.aspx](https://ir.virtu.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Virtu-Announces-Preliminary-Results-Year-To-Date-through-Feb-2020/default.aspx)

Virtu can primarily make money with market making in a few different ways.

1. Adding markets.
2. Adding symbols that they trade.
3. Increased volatility of the markets.
4. Increased volume of the markets.
5. Adding clients to their execution services.
6. Improving their internal matching.
7. Increasing their market share of profitable HFT activity.

&#x200B;

When volume goes up, Virtu makes money by participating in more transactions. When volatility goes up, they make money by making more money per transaction. That's because higher volatility is correlated with a larger spread. A larger spread means they can sell to party A for $1.05 and buy from party B for $1. The spread here is $.05. Typically, the spread is often only $.01.

They've also cited that the coronavirus will not affect their work. 
https://www.tsmc.com/tsmcdotcom/PRListingNewsAction.do?action=detail&newsid=THGOPGPGTH
 
Xiaomi one of TSMC's largest customers has cancelled orders from them because they don't have the demand for their smartphones.
https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20200226VL200.html

Hauwei, Apple, AMD, and Nvidia  (from what we know) haven't cancelled any orders or their revunue for February would have been terrible. Most of the Chinese firms were offline during the time so they likely cut orders when they were unable to work which is likely why it wasn't higher. 

Logically speaking, from this we can understand why Apple didn't ship as many phones to China even though they have been stockpiling chips from TSMC, they've been unable to get parts from Foxconn which will be online again in late March. 

https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-10/chinas-smartphone-shipments-nosedive-more-than-50-in-february-101526430.html

Then from what we can also gather is that TSMC will finally be able to mass produce 5nm chips for Apple's and Hauwei's 5g plans by the end of quarter 1 to early quarter 2. Apple is also planning on unveiling a cheap iPhone 9 which will likely a huge success like the 5c. 

AMD forsees 20% revunue growth this year. It is likely due to their new work with government which will be also run on TSMC chips. Nvidia will blow further higher with it's data center especially after such strong growth from last year, it's obvious to see why. 

Intel has given up even making their own chips to compete with TSMC.

https://appuals.com/intel-xe-gpu-flagship-tsmcs-6nm/

What does this have to do with anything? Well, strong consumer growth. And you're like even with the coronavirus running around stopping people from going outside? 

Yes, this is because it seems to be a seasonal thing:

https://www.techtimes.com/articles/247916/20200310/new-study-finds-warm-temperatures-could-kill-coronavirus-is-trump-right-in-saying-covid-19-will-subside-in-spring.htm

Hotter temperatures is a reality especially because of global warming, the Earth is hotter than it has ever been in recorded history. Because of that we will see a return to successful sales. As Apple begins to be able to stockpile and carry the economy forward. 

GDP will take a huge, and I mean huge hit this quarter. This is just from rational deduction. Boeing didn't get a single plane order in January. Boeing makes up a huge part of America's GDP. Supply shock likely hit hard in February. Simply from news going around, about how China had terrible output. 

Furthermore, oil clashes between Russia and the Saudis hurt the Saudis far more. Saudi economy is like 80% oil or something crazy like that. They cant afford to sell cheap for too long as Russia is like 30% oil. Meaning that Saudis will likely come back to negotiation table much sooner than we'd suspect. And because they'd rather not take the blame for the affect on the economy, they will likely move to a deal.

After this news people go into a selling frenzy and the stock market will be ripe for the picking. Then we'll be able to snatch up nice and cheap tech stocks that will ultimately cause 2nd quarter GDP to rise. Increasing our tendy count. With this news of 1st quarter GDP lose, we will be seeing people flee not realizing that the panic scare is over as likely by then the 737 max will be up and running again and things will be looking to better times.

So what I'm saying is to hedge against the economy until the terrible GDP report than to sell and buy calls for Boeing, TSM, Apple, AMD, NVDA(essentially any tech stock). Because we'll be heading back into better days.",2020-03-11 10:00:55

I hope the tendies rained supreme. Bear gang wins again. I do plan on inversing -- but not yet. I'll talk about that at the end...

[First post \[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffdrz0/covid_dd/)[Second post \[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgmxeb/this_isnt_over_not_by_a_long_shot_this_is_the/)

**COVID DD PART 3:**

So I'm here to follow up in particular on post 2... I made some models that made forecasts of COVID spread... so how my model has performed to date compared to my forecasts. First and foremost, this is being done before the end of the day... so these numbers should be a bit smaller than the actual. Second off, as this gets exponential into the tens of thousands it overloads the  medical system so reporting bias comes into play. I'll also do a forecast for Canada because the dick-tater of leaf-land [Castro's love child](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5d/cb/73/5dcb738a71759b1ca0a9031d874fe23d.jpg) just got it [\[3\]](https://globalnews.ca/news/6666482/justin-trudeau-self-isolation-coronavirus/). Looks like the '*day of the rake*' has finally arrived...

***Italy Updated:***

Anyways, my forecasts still remain but here's Italy... I did make a small error (actually a big error) for the lower bound thetas... so my lower bounds were off by a lot. But anyways my upper bounds were correct so here's the fixed forecast to the end of the month based on a CIR process to account for decreased spread through time on a Ne^(rt) exponential growth model [\[4\]](https://imgur.com/a/d5xNljy). Anyways, my upper bounds were correct but lower bounds were incorrect. Now the range for the end of the month is between 69,515 - 907,490. So far the model seems to be tracking closest to the 0.05 theta model. Here's the model numbers for your reference [\[5\]](https://imgur.com/a/H7prqhx). There seems to be a delay of up to two weeks so whatever quarantine measures that are put in place seem to have up to a two week lagg so I think we'll closely track to the 0.05 or 0.00 theta models for the next week or so (link 5).

&#x200B;

***France Updated:***

France seems to be way off so at the highest, expect the 0 theta numbers at best. Might be due to under-reporting bias, the fact that they've taken precautions and banned large events or maybe my models sucks. Anyways, use the lower bound as a high estimate for now. Once it's over 100,000 I mean you've got no clue anyways as far as I'm concerned. So factor that in. [\[6\]](https://imgur.com/a/Ep6TrRF) I'll try and adjust this model and maybe come up with a new forecast here in the next few days. Regardless president Macaroni just raised the white flag and shut down schools and is probably going to close the borders [\[7\]](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8106403/Emmanuel-Macron-orders-closure-schools-France-control-coronavirus.html).

&#x200B;

***USA Updated:***

This is the only model where the actual numbers are higher, which is interesting [\[8\]](https://imgur.com/a/rvDaSVk). So I would say we'll probably follow the high theta model and see somewhere around 80,000 sick in the USA by March 31st.

&#x200B;

***Canada Added:***

For Canada I mean... I think the numbers are a lot higher because of a few events that happened recently [\[9\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/toronto/article-toronto-man-diagnosed-with-covid-19-used-local-transit-for-three-days/) [\[10\]](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-first-community-spread-corona-case-in-ontario-connected-to/), but here's the forecast based off of a lagged model to try and account for the fact that other countries start to take precautions [\[11\]](https://imgur.com/a/HuDGT1z). 

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

I don't think these forecasts are particularly egregious whatsoever, in fact they're probably ultra conservative in reality. I mean Merkel was briefed and said that 70% of Germany could get this thing [\[12\]](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51835856). Canada just said the same thing [\[13\]](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-press-newsalert-federal-government-promises-1-billion-for-covid-19-fight) and allotted 1.1bn in response (and very poorly as well look at the numbers, LOLOL). 

I don't think Canada has been factored in yet still... but we've got some decent forecasts of what the future looks like from Europe and I still think we need to bet against retirement home stonks.

There is further pain for the oil business, even if Saudi and Russia hug and play 4-square again tomorrow without any further issues.  I want to help you all with some of my random thoughts and observations.  

Note: All of this is excluding the obvious uncertainties (ie: some crazy ass war starting)

DD justification: 11-year engineer for major oil company.  Recently worked in Permian Basin from 2014-2019.  I saw it explode up and I'm watching it explode down and hope to grab some tendies this time.

&#x200B;

* Oil prices will never, and oil company stock prices may never, return to their previous levels (not in the immediate future at least).  CVX was $130 in 2014 and has never past the $120 range since (oil crash in 2015/2016).  XOM was around $100 in the same time and since 2016 has been trending downward
* That said, oil WILL go back up when Saudi and Russia make a deal.  Russia is said to need oil at $30/bbl for it's budget, but Saudi needs \~$70 (I read somewhere..maybe Dr. Seuss).  Saudi is going to sweat in a few months
* The large companies pay a strong dividend.  If someone knows what that is please tell me.  Boomers say it's ""safe""?
* CVX is committed to dividend, so much so that previous CEOs have said ""I will not be the one to cut the dividend"".  
* I fully expect 2020 to finish below $50/bbl, maybe even $40/bbl
* Forecast demand for oil was already low for 2020, it's now going to be even lower thanks to nocturnal creature soup

Ok now on to the fun stuff, the Permian independents

* They have already taken an absolute beating due to Saudi/Russia play fighting
* A lot of these companies started paying dividends.  Look at their yields **(APA is 12%!!)** if you're trying to find one to buy puts on (CXO, XEC, FANG, SM, OXY, PXD).  OXY announced they were slashing their dividend from 0.79 to 0.11, it was probably good that they just took their beating, so now they can recover.
* The companies that started or pay dividends also have good amounts of debt, given that banks were just pouring them money in 2016-2018.  So if they cut dividends (which they started/increased to attract shareholders), prices will plummet.
* Some will fail or be bought by larger companies (remember OXY buying APC? Damn that seems dumb now), so the price could jump

Service Companies

* When oil drops, every operator puts the squeeze on service companies.  Rigs, services (SLB, NOV) all cut their prices to stay in operation.  Packages and tools are removed because they're not essential (who cares about some fancy tool when a basic one will do?).  When oil comes back up, most of the time those fancy tools aren't even needed any more.
* Puts on all the service companies until Q2.  I wouldn't touch them honestly.  They're going to drop and then get bought by one of the other companies (likely SLB or HAL).
* SLB's yield is 13% lmao that's getting cut

Positions: I had CVX $85p 3/20 and sold like the paper handed newbie I am when it was at 90.  Absolutely kicking myself for that one. OXY 6/19 $15p (sold right before ole Icahn bought in even more) and EOG 7/17 $27.5p (I don't expect EOG to go that low but it was cheap and it's bigly printing).  When oil prices stabilize, maybe CVX 2021 $80c or XOM 2021 $55c

&#x200B;

TLDR: be careful on oil; it is not going to rocket back up; LEAPs on large majors when Saudis lift cuts of maybe 20% of current price sometime 2021 (if you're ballsy 2021/2022 XOM $70 and CVX $90); there's still a lot of pain for the Permian producers; service companies are going to be destroyed too (looking at you NOV)",2020-03-13 04:24:40

[Obviously this is wrong](https://preview.redd.it/ouxjxepmebm41.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c934bab46a40f76ea4c8e613a50007c9506742c)

Because in reality viruses don't infect exponentially they infect logistically, which is basically an exponential curve but half way in they stop growing and move into a flat line. This point is decided by the Growth Factor which in this case is the number of new infections today divided by the number of new infections the day before. If the growth factor is consistently less than one then we're beyond the halfway point and infections are going to slow to a halt. So what is that gonna happen?

[Well this fucking impossible to interpret](https://preview.redd.it/f2qw9yr5hbm41.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=f13fa9f4ca92f1b4a5d1af5b527e7b912d0455ba)

as long as it's above one we're looking at exponential growth, and it's not looking like it's gonna drop like the DJIA any day now. But if a basic line of best fit is anything to go by, it's most likely gonna happen at the end of the month. So where does that put us then?

The half way point is roughly at a million infected outside China on April 1. Which also means we have about another month and a half of the virus being a complete fucking shit show. After that it should be pretty clear that infection rates are dropping and bull market will continue as usual. Until then expect the economy to be completely shut down.

This means if you work in construction or anyone who has to be at work, you aren't gonna be able to buy a house.  This means a lack in demand.

3. Compared to the rest of the market sell-off, the stock has been holding up relatively well for a big-cap.

&#x200B;

**How it plays out next:**

1. As the sell-off panic continues, sellers will try and figure out good ""virus stocks"" to shift some funds into.
2. Assuming there is any kind of anecdotal evidence of those experimental patients improving, rumors about the experimental drug will spread.
3. This is the search trend results for ""remedisivir"" and ""gilead"" from the last 7 days. The uptrend is obvious - even if the institutional investors don't bite, the desperate to ""get some gains back"" retail investors are going to start jumping in.

WWE is currently trading at \~32.30 I told people to buy when it was sitting at 38. 30 Strike 3/20 puts were a mere 25 cents a piece. Currently worth over 3 bucks.

Now its not to late for these reasons:

[Wrestlemania is the only large sporting event](https://twitter.com/WFLADaisy/status/1238163228921864192) that has yet to be cancelled.

* They gave WWE 1 week to decide what to do. It appeared they did not want to be the ones that pull the plug they want WWE to do it.
* Should WWE fail to pull the plug, executives will meet again on 3/19 at 1:30EST to discuss what to do from there
* Tampa already cancelled St Patrick Day parade and large conventions.
* Tampa governor calls for [mass gatherings being held in the next 30 days to be postponed](https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2020/03/12/governor-of-florida-host-state-for-wrestlemania-says-mass-gatherings-scheduled-for-next-30-days-should-be-postponed-to-mitigate-coronavirus-spread/)

WWE and the XFL is owned by McMahon 

* [XFL hosted Seattle games without fans](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/03/11/xfl-announces-seattle-dragons-will-host-game-without-fans/). No fans no money. Other cities will follow. There might even be an outright cancellation of games

Finally; WWE is literally 200 pound half naked men pretending to kill each other on a dirty mat.

This is a PSA.  This is all happening because the market is pricing in potential worst case scenarios, as I have been hearing for days from CNBC and Bloomberg TV.  Once some good news comes through, specifically the start of mass testing in the United States and a subsequent decline of new cases.

Also, don't forget Russia and the Saudis are squabbling over oil prices.  The Fed basically just showed that it will inject however much money is necessary to prop this economy up.  Once Congress gets their head out of each other's ass and push something bipartisan through to counter the biological issue we could see a pop... IMO thats what the market is waiting on.

I'm not saying sell your Puts, and I'm not saying blow your wad on Calls..  I'm slowly buying in and averaging down LEAPS with AMD.  Currently, they are the only company I believe will have explosive growth once this subsides. They even said they expect to continue the growth they've experienced over the last few years.

That could be enough liquidity. Keep reading if you want to decide for yourself.

Edit 2: Trade looks good still. Apparently that was not enough liquidity based on the action afterwards. Also made less wordy.

I watch the treasury market quite a bit and it seems to have broken on 3/8. My hypothesis is that a liquidity crunch is forcing selling even as those positions are deep in the money and should have been ""safe.""

With the recent market route bonds should have continued to rise (with their yields falling), but instead they had a massive reversal with both an all time rise and then drop within three trading days.

If you have any thoughts on why the treasury market is acting like this that I have not outlined then mention them in the comments and I will add them in.

**Why are treasuries falling after 3/8 instead of being a safe haven?**

1. Margin call?

There could have been a very large long bond/long (leveraged) stocks play that got margin called on 3/8, but that shouldn't have continued on the 10th, 11th, and today. Granted todays move is quite muted.

2. Selling treasuries to buy stocks?

Maybe on 3/8 and 3/10, but that doesn't explain 3/9 and today when bonds and stocks were sold off.

3. Fallout from the oil market and these bond sellers are sniffing long-term damage to the petrodollar?

Maybe. I don't know how to support or disprove that thesis.

4. liquidity crunch?

Yes. We know from the repo market that there has been one simmering for some months now, and we know that banks suddenly had to scramble on 3/8 to inject more liquidity to meet the minimum funding levels required by law after their oil loans took such a hit.

**How to profit?**

Wager on treasuries, especially long duration, falling sharply with a climb in yields. TLT, or any of the 3x bear/bull instruments could be used.

I opened some puts on TLT 3/20 @ 136. They were .13 when I got in and some deals to be had if you check each strike as they were not very reasonably arrayed.

Here are some ideas that still have room to go a LOT lower: 

VAIL Resorts - This is a large premier mountain/ski resort business. Lot's of California and Colorado exposure. Highly levered and expensive vacations. Buy the 135 April 17s.

Hitlon - Still lot of room to go down. Buy the Jun'20 70 puts. Lot of European exposure.

Starbucks - More work from home, less travel, less business meetings and less in-store revenue. Starbucks performs based on peoples addiction. Once people buy a machine at home they get out of the habit of going to starbucks. Buy the March 27th 60 put. This is a sub50 stock by end of the month.

Disney - This one has been hit again and again like a dead horse but there is still a lot of potential here. NBA and MLS are cancelling games when ESPN is reeling. The cruises/hotels/parks will shut down. It's not a matter of if but when. People will be at home and finally realize Disney+ sucks balls. No movies. Wow quadruple whammy baby.

WWE as far as I know is the only publicly traded sports league. Not only does it have its Super Bowl equivalent, Wrestlemania, in April. Not only is it underwhelming its new TV deal...

It also has its newly-founded XFL. I think people don't realize how much corona could hurt the XFL. If the MLB, NBA, and NCAA (and maybe NHL soon) are all cancelling games/seasons, I think the XFL will have to follow suit. Since the XFL brand is not an established one, it has more to lose. Also, the XFL schedule was specifically designed to fill in this lull in American sports that happens in February and March, but that schedule is going to be fucked either way. Also, since there are only 8 teams in the league, there is more exposure than a 32 team league has.

Guess where some of the 8 teams are? NY = lots of cases, Seattle = lots of cases, LA = cases, Texas = cases, Tampa = cases, DC = cases, maybe St Louis is safe idk. Has this all been priced-in? I do not think so.

But yeah, WWE $30p 3/20 (and 4/17 if you less of a degen)

EDIT 1: I guess Alpha (XFL) and WWE are technically separate, but McMahon is McMahon, and the public/investors are going to link the two. I think it is just as credible a link as puts on MSG secondary to NBA suspension, or something like that. But, fade this read if you want, IDC. Wrestlemania is probably half-priced in, so even if XFL has no impact (which I still think it will), I think WWE bottom is still lower.

DD,DD: CACC Credit Acceptance Corp is a sleeper put,20,fhh116,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhh116/dd_cacc_credit_acceptance_corp_is_a_sleeper_put/,43,1584051539.0,"I've been searching for stocks that should be impacted by (a) the virus and (b) recession, but haven't been yet. CACC is a subprime auto financing corporation for consumer auto loans. The subprime auto loan sector is already unstable as fuck. Americans owe over $1.2 trillion in fucking auto loans, and over 5% are 3 months or more behind on their car payments. That's 7 million bad loans.  


CACC has an F rating from SCHWAB, under perform from Credit Suisse, avoid from Market Edge, Underperform from Reuters, and a buy from CFRA. Their credit rating is Baa3, the lowest investment grade bond.   


On February 13, days before the crash, investment fraud law firm Zamansky LLC announced on businesswire that the wyould be investigating CACC for breach of fiduciary duty, claiming that \*\*""the State of Mississippi has charged Credit Acceptance with being a “\[p\]redatory subprime auto lender,” seeking disgorgement and civil penalties for various unfair and deceptive practices. The Company has also seen a deterioration in credit quality, a rise in delinquencies, and a drop in the loan collection rate. ""\*\*  


However, the stock price was unaffected.  


On Feb 20, they dropped 10% with the crash but rallied to an incredible 2% net return between the crash and yesterday March 10, and finally tanked in today's market by 8.5%.  


Their leading competitor Santander Consumer USA SC is down 24% since the crash. Santander has its own problems and is probably a good put as well, but I believe CACC is a major sleeper opportunity that will tank on open and drop like a rock.  


Disclaimer - I don't know shit, I'm not a trader, and I just did all this research tonight. Also haven't slept for about 36 hours. If you know shit about the sector and can explain to me why a subprime auto lender has held up like a champ during this crash, please let me know before I buy puts

Every time trump spoke SPY fell by a lot. Curious to see how Monday goes.


UPDATE: bought calls, ready to get shafted tomorrow, but will probably hold until EOD when I’ll swap them for puts in anticipation of bad news over the weekend.


Disclaimer: I’m a degenerate who likes looking at graphs and has a gambling addiction (and uses RH)

Hi, it's me again. If you think I am a gay retard and made you upset bc you can’t read feel free to give me a pride award, it’ll be an honour. If I helped you make tendies, donate somewhere.

First of all, I must say thank you to all the people who I got the awards from, means a lot to me to be valued by this autistic community.

By no means should people blindly follow my advice! I am a degenerate myself and am relatively new to this. Not many of you have big brains, but even just a couple of cells should be sufficient to make your own decisions.

***What happened yesterday?***

The market was very uncertain during the last 45 minutes of the day and until last 2 minutes, the 15min candle was closing on red which was a signal to buy puts according to my retarded TA. Very, unfortunately, things took an interesting turn and the candle turned red.

After the market closed Trump fucked everyone up by suspending travelling and bullshiting yet again (maybe he got beer flu himself, who knows), as a result, the stonks went down.

***What did I do yesterday?***

For those who wondered and haven't read the updated in my post. Since the last candle was likely going to be green I have sent an order to buy puts, but thanks to our wonderful cocksucker Robinhood, the order wasn’t filled in time and I was left tendieless( Yes, I know, I need to switch to another platform. Will do as soon as I can.

***What’s to do next?***

If you still want my advice here we go. I am still sticking to my strategy today and if this time if the market is closing with *3 consistent green 15minute candles*, I’ll reverse their action. I will try to submit an order earlier and not get fucked again (in case if I buy calls and the market does indeed go up in the morning I will sell right away, can't hold calls for long in this market). Why could it bounce back temporarily? Well, no one knows, but fed could step in and do something, just like on Tuesday when SPY rose overnight. Another reason is that people might've oversold this morning.

Please be careful and don’t fully rely on my thoughts, they are just thoughts and I don’t mind to yolo my own money. We are in a bull market and SPY is a lot more likely to go down than up on a given day, so be careful and thoughtful with your actions. We are in a legendary period of time when it is quite easy to make money due to the volatility, just don’t be retarded.

I am expecting the SPY to go up right before the end of the day on Friday and if it does I will buy puts. If it doesn’t I’ll still buy puts, we’re in a bear market fuckers!

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: We’re all fucked, tell your family you love them and make good use of this bear market, literally any SPY puts further than 3 weeks away and hold until Monday.

1. **INTRO**

3. **EXPLANATION**
4. **MY POSITIONS**
5. **READING LIST**

Hello /r/wallstreetbets and fellow autists (ever realize that autist is just one letter away from artist?). I hope you're having a good morning. I'm here to give you a big reading list.

----

**But first, the TLDR:**

- Coof coofs from beer virus will make people stop work
- People stop work, can't pay loans
- People not work, their company fails, company defaults on loans
- HIP-states begin to fail because they have falling tax revenue, failing infrastructure, and are already highly indebted (Highly Indebted Countries list)
- Banks start to fail due to liquidity/repo issues compounding with the aforementioned issues - they either get bailed out or fail, either way they drop a lot
- 🌈🧸 market forever
- **BUY PUTS ON BANKS *(ESPECIALLY THOSE EXPOSED TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, HOLDING PANDEMIC BONDS, OR IN THE 3RD WORLD/DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. FOCUS ON INDIA/SE ASIA/AFRICA IF YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING TO TRADE THERE.)***
- Or, if you're lazy, buy puts on the indices /u/Joesocktwo listed in [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/fjmjpxv/).

I had the (dis?)pleasure of visiting the World Economic Forum in Davos this year. I was invited because a Swiss investment group provided seed funding for my company, and they had a few events there. It was a fun, strange time. I had Nouriel Roubini yell at me about crypto being a scam, mistook Robert Shiller for a waiter (he looked good in his tux), and talked with Mr. Solomon - DJ D-Sol - about his career as a DJ, without knowing who he was. See these pictures: 

A lot of people in Davos were scared about the Coronavirus, but they're all even more scared about debt. Bankers are terrified because a debt crisis is coming, and no one has any idea what to do about it. All the tools in the toolbox are broken, and all the nuts that can be tightened are nearly stripped. There is no plan.

I started reading more about the repo market, the debt crisis we're in, and how this beer virus is compounding this. We're pretty fucked - so we may as well get some tendies out of the whole mess. I can't explain the gravity of the situation to you with you reading the reading list below. Skim through the articles and see what interests you, and then read the ones that sound scariest to you. I also highly recommend the one from the ""World Socialist Website"" - **[Growing fears of global debt crisis](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/01/22/debt-j22.html)** - probably written by some Trans-Geographical Ethnic Economies Studies B.A. holder, but it's well put together. Also note the **[Corporate Debt Article](https://www.financialsense.com/blog/18927/size-corporate-debt-one-rung-above-junk-has-never-been-greater-warns-louis-gave)** (with this attached diagram https://imgur.com/a/4KhGW2m).

Boy, wait til you see what's going to happen in Canada in the near future. Canada is heavily dependent on Tourism and Oil. Their country is about to head into a deep recession all thanks to a fucking virus. No more tourism dollar, people will be out of jobs, companies getting shut and mortgages getting foreclosed.

Their greedy bankers have allowed the oil industries to borrow at massive amounts. They were already hurting even before the Coronavirus and Oil news. The bankers were hoping that Oil would hit at least $70 or $80 per barrel. Who can blame them though right? Who would have thought that Oil would hit $30 in 2020. Plus they have this sand sand oil that is impossible to refine or make a profit given the current oil price.

I'm sorry Canadians, but your government have allowed real estate to get way out of control there. A below average home goes for about a mil in Toronto or Vancouver while most average citizens were making $12 to $14 bucks an hour.

DD,Here's the good Disney thread so you don't have to read the shitty ones 🐭,532,fhe6cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhe6cb/heres_the_good_disney_thread_so_you_dont_have_to/,199,1584037383.0,"First of all, will the autists who are saying that people will stay home because of coronavirus and watch Disney+ all day (which will somehow help Disney's financial situation) pour themselves a warm glass of shut the hell up and drink some of it?  The ultimate DIS thesis is below.

**Summary**

Disney will fail miserably this year.  It is already failing in the most epic way, but it's just the beginning for us who were smart enough to 🌈🐻 it.  There are great American stories about success out there. Disney's 2020 adventures will not be among them.  Disney's stock will reach the lows they haven't seen in years for the reasons provided below.  Yes, it's fun to short pathetic loser companies like SeaWorld and Six Flags, but do you have what it takes to watch the asshole Goliath like Disney get fucked AND get paid for watching?  Find out why and how.

**Streaming**

Disney has 30 million Disney+ subscribers and 30 million Hulu subscribers.  Based on those numbers, the revenue from streaming is $3.6 billion a year (out of Disney's $59 billion total revenue).  The profit is, however, much smaller.  The Mandalorian costs $15 million per episode to make, while The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, WandaVision and Hawkeye will run close to $25 million per episode.  All in all, the budget for making content for Disney+ is approximately $1 billion for 2020 alone.  Also subtract from 2020 revenue all the royalties they have lost by taking ALL their content off Netflix and other networks.

They have also spent billions on infrastructure and promotion of Disney+, so the best they were hoping for in 2020 was break even or maybe come in $0.5-1B ahead, which again, is very small.

Bottom line on streaming: it's tiny and is more of a liability than an asset when other divisions are crashing.

[Disney is Spending a Ton of Money on Disney+, Including an Almost $1 Billion Original Content Budget](https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-plus-costs/)

**Network TV**

It's a bad year for sports, and ESPN will suffer greatly.  Because of the broad decline in the economy, advertising budgets of ALL companies will shrink, and ABC will also suffer greatly.  Less money from the ads - less money for the mouse.


**Box office**

MGM recently moved 007 to November, but the assholes at Disney are pretending like Black Widow (due April 24) is not going to be moved.  Jesus Christ, of course it is.  New York is going to be on lockdown in a few days as will many other places.  There will be no fucking movie watching this spring.  They spent $200 million making Black Widow and expected it to make a billion.  That's a billion they are not going to have now.  But that's only part of the problem with Black Widow, the official launch movie of MCU Phase 4.

Black Widow is not 007, and Marvel is not MGM.  Marvel has no flexibility to move Black Widow because of the way they plan their lineup.  Moving Black Widow to November severely fucks with their budget and timeline for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Everything was riding on it, and they will now have to move releases AND production of upcoming MCU movies with established schedules out to 2021 and 2022.  That completely fucks their projected box office for those years.  It also fucks up their Disney+ lineup and affects the production of those shows.  And merchandise.  And a ton of other shit.

Mulan?  They fucking canceled it in Asia.  The movie they made for Asia.  Canceled in Asia.

**Parks**

I am just going to save myself the energy and not bother writing about these retarded places where fat kids stuff their faces with ice cream and get fondled by characters, or vice versa.  The parks will be closed.  Orlando, Anaheim, and Paris.


**Cruises**

Lol


**Target price**

Yes, it has already dropped by a lot.  So fucking what, idiots?  Stop repeating the same dumb shit over and over.  DIS was $98 less than a year ago and $92 in 2016, and that was without a pandemic that cancelled their biggest movies and closed all their parks, and there was no massive recession.

Even without closed parks and canceled movies, they already hit a $100.40 low in pre-market trading.  The 100p guys are practically in the money, but I don't care because I'm no 100p March 20 retard, no sir (more on that below).  

Without the parks closed and Black Widow cancelled, DIS already has already been dropping 1-1.5 percent more than total SPY drop on the bad days.  It's like the more extreme, crackhead version of SPY that's going down quickly.  Futures are currently down a full 5%, which means DIS will be firmly under $100 today, and that will lay down the groundwork for big, juicy drops for my April puts.

Specifically, I anticipate a $15 drop when the parks are closed and another $5-10 drop when Black Widow is cancelled.  I expect further drops as TV talking heads start spending time talking about how Disney is dropping and how no one would have expected that 6 months ago.  Jim Cramer will go from ""Buy Disney, it's cheap"" to ""Wow, I actually think that Disney is not going to do too well in the next two years.""  That will tip boomer over the edge, and his weak hands will lead him to selling what he will have left of DIS at that time.

TL;DR My Apr 17 $75 puts will be firmly in the money when all is said and done.  


**Tendies (chart)**

I have made a table of how the various tendies will print, depending on how far DIS drops.  Because each strike has its own IV, the outcomes are different.  I believe there is room for a drop to $50 and thus maximized my number of contracts.  But in any scenario, it will print.  The prices are still OK last time I checked despite the obviously high IV.

https://i.imgur.com/LUrl0cQ.png

Yes, I know DIS will not go bankrupt, the $0.01 column is just for fun

Note that these tendies do not include any time value.  If the events described above (parks, movies) happen in March, you will also be paid a cumload in premiums for your in-the-money puts that boomer's broker will be buying to hedge his long positions.

**Positions**

123 contracts total, most with TDA and some with Robinhood, just because I want to experience the thrill of my orders failing again.

You can call this a YOLO play but to me it's a common-sense play, to bet against a company that makes money on movies, parks, cruises, and hotels in a year when there will be no movies, parks, cruises or hotels.

***P. S.*** I do enjoy Disney animated movies and the Marvel movies even though they are cheesy as shit, but my overall feelings towards Disney as a company are overwhelmingly negative for making mockery of the copyright clause of the U.S. constitution and ruining copyright law for the entire 20th century by lobbying the fuck out of Congress to extend copyright terms until they became utterly ridiculous (which didn't stop the U.S. from pressuring the rest of the world to adopt them via mandatory WIPO membership for pretty much all countries).  I am looking forward to the tendies but I would not at all be upset if Disney got severely punished for being a completely amoral company and making so many asshole practices an industry norm.

**Tickers: LQD, HYG, JNK**

**Move: Puts**

So for the last three days I have been watching treasury yields rise sharply and scratched my head as to why while the equities indices were making new 52 week lows. For the past two weeks yields have been crashing as big money exited equities and into ""havens"" like treasuries. Except all of that reversed course on Monday as most of you might have noticed. How are those TLT calls doing, guys? 

This has lead me to read a ton more about the corporate bond market and the possibility of a fuck-ton of downgrades coming for highly-levered companies being hammered by coronavirus. 

Then there is this jewel:

[Treasuries and Junk Bonds Reverse Safety Trades. Investment-Grade Bets Falter, After the BBBs’ Worst Day Ever.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/treasuries-and-junk-bonds-reverse-safety-trades-investment-grade-bets-falter-after-the-bbbs-worst-day-ever-51583856737)


> Treasuries are falling and high-yield bonds rising as traders reverse some of their safe-haven moves from recent days.

>But the most notable credit-market moves are happening in investment-grade bonds, which are extending declines after one of their worst sessions in decades.

>Investment-Grade Debt One of the biggest exchange-traded funds tracking high-rated corporate debt, the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (ticker: LQD), was down 0.4% early Tuesday. The fund’s 2.4% Monday decline marked its worst trading session since the financial crisis, and its eighth-biggest daily decline on record. While ETF prices provide a real-time gauge of market performance, they track a narrow group of bonds.

>By a more comprehensive reading, Monday was the investment-grade market’s second-worst day on record, and the declines were driven by the lowest-rated tier, known as “the BBBs.” The gap (or spread) between yields on the ICE BofA U.S. Corporate Index, a broad benchmark of investment-grade debt, and comparable Treasuries widened by the most of any day on record other than Oct. 10, 2008, during the height of the financial crisis.

>BBB bonds had their worst day on record on Monday, according to ICE BofAML Indices, in a single-day selloff that was more severe than any they experienced during the financial crisis. The BBBs’ yield spreads over Treasuries widened by half a percentage point, the most of any single session in at least 23 years.

>Investors have worried about the growth in that market over the past decade, which has left roughly half of the investment-grade corporate bond market rated in the three tiers closest to junk (BBB+, BBB and BBB-). No ETFs appear to track only BBB-rated corporate bonds, so it wasn’t clear whether they were responsible for the losses in early Tuesday trading.

>Treasuries U.S. Treasury prices were lower Tuesday, pushing yields of all maturities higher, as the market got a break from the buying pressure that came with Monday’s stock-market selloff.

>Benchmark 10-year and 30-year yields rebounded slightly from record lows, because investors were venturing out of the haven Treasury market and back into risky securities such as stocks and high-yield debt.

>Junk Bonds While safe government debt was falling, the high-yield bond market was rebounding after suffering one of the worst sessions on record on Monday.

>The two largest junk-bond exchange-traded funds—the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (JNK)—both climbed around 1.8% in early Tuesday trading.

>Those gains follow the third-worst day for the junk-bond market in the 23 years that ICE BofAML Indices has followed it. The two trading sessions that saw a larger jump in the market’s implied risk: Sept. 14, 2001, the first day of bond-market trading after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks; and Oct. 10, 2008.

>The high-yield ETFs didn’t experience similarly sharp losses on Monday. The iShares HYG fund lost 4.3%, its eighth-worst day on record, and the SPDR JNK fund fell 4.7%, its sixth-worst day. Still, both posted their worst daily declines since the financial crisis.

>My own commentary: This is sort of interesting. Hypothetically, BBB rated bonds should have rebounded roughly as much as BB,B, CCC, or worse ratings since they have somewhat similar characteristics here, but instead they got hammered.

>There were some commenters talking about this a bit a few days ago, and it looks like they may be right: BBB bonds seem to be misrated currently in the market risk wise, a little bit like how MBS were often given a AA or AAA rating before the great financial crisis due to pressure placed on the ratings agencies by banks to give good ratings.

>The bar is ""make this investment grade"", and it is entirely possible a lot of the BBB bond ratings really should be BB or B ratings, and pressure is causing rating agencies to overrate the bottom tier of investment grade bonds.

>The expected effect of this would be for BB and B rated and worse junk bond funds to increase in value to something more close to BBB bond funds, and for BBB bond funds to drop based on the market as a whole re-rating them lower, even if the agencies did not actually change their ratings.

>This is exactly what we are seeing, and it should be sort of interesting. The low end of corporate bond may not be as safe as thought.

This is where **LQD** comes in. **LQD** is the largest ETF holding of B and BBB rated corporate debt.

[Breakdown of Debt Quality](https://i.imgur.com/NfiBjgP.png)

Some of the holdings include our friends Boeing, Deustche Bank, JPM, BAC, and others. Financials & energy, particularly hard hit during this downturn, are facing liquidity struggles (Fed handing out repos like water now)

These ""investment grade"" bonds used to be classic safe havens, like treasuries and gold. Well somebody realized they aren't anymore as of Monday. As the economy nears recession, bond markets do some wacky shit and no longer follow established trends. 

Corporate debt issuance combined with government debt issuance is about to rise to historic levels as companies struggle to meet liquidity requirements. 

[Tumble in bond yields will lead to ‘the trade of our lifetime’ in this investor’s scenario](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/lawrence-mcdonald-tumble-in-bond-yields-the-trade-of-our-lifetime.html?&qsearchterm=trade%20of%20a%20lifetime)

The greatest risk to these so called ""investment grade"" bonds is an impending wave of downgrades due to cut revenue, liquidity issues, layoffs, all that jazz that comes with a recession. 

I can't time any of these downgrades, so I'm not calling any short term plays, but I think they are coming in the next few months and LQD and others like it are going to be tanking. 

This is not dissimilar from 08 when junk MBS's were being boxed up and rated AAA. Corporate bond prices have a long, long way to fall. Coupled with an impending massive increase in private and public debt issuance (driving yields up), price risk to the downside is tremendous. 

TL:DR, 4/17 , 5/15 puts on LQD are still cheap, go ham",2020-03-12 08:21:03

Considering most of the major provinces were entirely shutdown this will obviously had a large impact on the revenue and profits of Alibaba.

I think a lot of people consider AlbBaba the Amazon of China, but unlike Amazon AliBaba is really a holdings company that is the poster child for many different Chinese businesses that help produce through ecommerce.

Considering that AliBaba is an ecommerce business, obviously these divisions of the entire company are entirely reliant upon exportation of goods. 

That would mean during the quarantine these companies would have zero production, exports, or revenue. I would also imagine that because of this there had to be reallocation of cash and other resources to ensure the divisions of the company were able to stay afloat and ""in business""

*Now I know you're probably thinking ""no shit they are just going to take a hit on their revenue, profits, etc,""*

**Here's the catch:**

It's obvious China is an authoritarian government with complete control over it's people and economy.

**But did you know that AliBaba, the face of the Chinese economy, reports their own financial statements to the SEC. There is no investigating, no possible method of verification, yet we still allow US investors to ""invest"" because it is out of our jurisdiction. They report their earnings to SAIC (China's SEC), who then reports it the SEC. But what the fuck is stopping them from propping up balance sheets 10x as an incentive to bring more American cash flow into their own economy.** 

**Stop looking at AliBaba as the face of Chinese free markets, the same ""free market"" that bans short selling, and starting see it as the fiscal puppet of the regime.**

Is it crazy to think AliBaba's financial statements are in fact fraudulent, reporting cash balance, revenue, and profits as a result of financial subsidiary by the regime itself? Like what the fuck could the SEC do to verify any of that shit yet it is still listed on our exchanges. 

I think there is a huge chance that it's really an initial bubble as an attempt to bring more US money into the Chinese economy. Who the fuck is stopping them from having say $10-100 billion in total assets and reporting shit like previous reported 179% growth in revenue. 

Also note that Jack Ma's foundation sent millions of masks and testing kits to the US today, generous indeed, but you're telling me that China coming out of quarantine and a massive shortage of these products suddenly ramps production that quickly and decides to donate it instead of focusing on gaining back lost profits. Or is it really an attempt to put trust back in the US investors that AliBaba has incredible production capacity.

What are your thoughts?

**TL;DR: AliBaba is an unregulated business in authoritarian regime with complete control in any reporting of its balance sheets. With the effects of the corona virus we need to keep an eye out on fraudulent financial statements.**",2020-03-14 07:46:13

Yep, sovereign bonds. Specifically, Japanese and German bonds that's still considered a safe haven in this world full of crashing markets and full on pandemic induced liquidity crunch. People sell anything they can get cash to meet margin calls with and yet these sovereigns have held up remarkably well because people think this only goes up in bear markets. What were the other ""safe"" havens people are now liquidating? One starts with a G and ends with OLD and the other is something something bitcoin.

The financial crisis and great recession in 08 had arguably been averted by ultra low interest rates where banks borrowed money from the central bank's only to buy long dated government issuances for lit free tendies like the autists that all professionals like to pretend they are not. Nowhere had this retarded behavior been as apparent as in the German and Japanese bond market (at least the most liquid ones)

I won't pretend I'm some expert on repos and leverage on eurodollars like that noob that got all that attention week or two ago but I am retarded enough to make a bet that this trade is in the starting stages of unwinding. At the very least, people will prefer US treasuries with a Fed going zero rates rather than retarded ECB that has set their facility rates at neg 0.4% and Japan with no choice but to keep monetizing to the point they are literally holding 30% of stock ETFs (Google it) to the point these two more retarded central banks are so much more retarded than even our own retarded Fed.

Best part of this trade is the IV on sovereign bonds is retardedly low for these sovereigns (no one expects them to blow out) Bunds is around 10% and JGBs are a measely 6%. In a world where all our retarded SPY puts are around 80% that is a steal.

So since you've read this far, here's the trades (and my positions linked)

Puts on 10Y German Bunds (ticker GBL in interactive brokers) any strike below 173 with Jun Expiry (next futures roll)

Puts on 10Y JGBs (ticker JGB in interactive brokers) any strike below 162 with Apr or May expiry (more liquid)

I put my money where these thoughts are but that doesn't mean you should. Please don't blame me if central banks somehow keep this bubble going for another 6 months and the most you'll lose is a few thousand dollars in premium per contract.

TLDR: VXX or UVXY puts 50%-80% OTM, June or later 

\----

If you lost money today on calls/puts for a reason other than the market going the other way, it's due to your implied volatility being destroyed. For everyone not from r/all, this is what happens to option FDs after the report, but on a massive scale that is affecting essentially all options on any assets on the market. 

Volatility essentially is at all time highs because no one knows what is going to happen tomorrow. You can go up 10% or go down 10% (as we've seen this week). Those selling these options aren't going to give their risks of losing >100% for cheap. When you buy these options, you are essentially paying for the probability you're still going to get 10% moves every day. 

Having >10% moves per day for extended times (more than 1 month) is essentially impossible. Go look at VIX and you'll see things calm down within 1-2 months. Thus, even if we keep going down, but at 2% of day, IV will drop. This is why VIX looks like a seismic map. 

Why now? 

On technical charts, we've had a bearish engulfing. The top is probably in. 

 https://imgur.com/CGDKSm7 

The reason why we had such massive spikes was due to Trump saying nothing during his Oval Office speech and Lagarde saying the ECB isn't responsible for closing the spreads for crap countries like Italy. The ECB has the ability to do this (Draghi did it) but you know... she's French. 

After two rounds of circuit breakers, governments noticed they messed up. They are actively doing the fiscal and monetary route. Plus, other than Trump getting the virus and 100k cases in the US, the worst like closing Disneyland or NYC is already somewhat priced in. Priced in = at least less probability of huge downswings like this week.

For all the r/all still running into FD calls or puts, good luck. Please realize that even if you get the direction right, the lack of massive moves will eat into the value of your option. For everyone who has some understanding of how options work, a June (or later) short isn't that bad of a play.",2020-03-14 01:45:11

Edit 3: MONDAY UPDATE\* Premarket this stock was up 14% early Friday and down 13% early monday, seriously an insane ride of emotions... I honestly had the worse weekend thinking about this because I agree with some of the commenters that much of this stock was already priced in...when I placed the trade, I thought I had the information of a lifetime, and acted on it with autistic confidence...lesson learned, to truly make money, you have to decipher the information, worst/best case scenarios before people are even aware, and take options as accordingly. Like one commenter mentioned below, this was like trying to eat what little is left in the bone.

LUCKILY, within the first 15 minutes (after circuit breaker) I liquidated all my options in chunks on this play as fast as I could, even at some losses/market price vs my buy price as I felt super uneasy with the movement and had the gut feeling it would spike up (which it did around moving closer to 10a and up. It may still tank, but I think it's a strong investor buy. It has heavy resistance to break $9.50, so the downside is not worth the attempt from an options standpoint. Luckily I was able to leave this position when the stock was still down, however, I did lose approx. $2500.00 from premium BUT I am honestly SUPER happy at the end result because after Friday's close, like most mentioned, the stock was up 10% AH...and would have been like that Monday if we had a green day, I think if not for the red day, I would have been slaughtered....the entire weekend was super hard for me, I was hoping for some recovery which happened, this stock held up really well even with a massive red day...if you're a long term holder, I would consider even buying this one as I believe it's at its bottom.

I would also note, personally, I've decided I'll never trade going into the weekend anymore, don't have the shirt for it.

&#x200B;

note 1: I would also note, personally, I've decided I'll never trade going into the weekend anymore, don't have the shirt for it..literally was surfing news relentlessly hoping the winds would change and probably was my most unproductive weekend ever.

note2: Be super careful with short and long puts, this situation can drastically change on information, and the money can disappear in an instant. With the amount of minds looking for a solution, the market is pricing in every bit of news each market day.  Be fking grateful with what you have made thus far as a gay bear and manage risk, I almost really fked up.

SPY could reach a low of 135 - 170 before this bear market ends, especially once the recession hits (which everybody is now expecting due to the coronavirus).

That said, the rate of decline is expected to slow down considerably.  That means put options will lose value even if the market goes down - due to vega.  So the best play right now is spreads.  Sell call options instead, and make money.

TLDR: Stop buying puts. Sell calls instead.  Vega is going to crush you.

How? When companies go to refinance their short term debts this summer, it will be too risky for firms to take on that debt. The premiums that they will charge companies to refinance their debt will be too much for companies who just watched their revenues evaporate for 2 months. And if firms don't refinance their debts, the CDSs start flaring and firms start going bankrupt on both sides of the fence.

We don't yet know if the extent that revenues will be hit for corporations, but what we do know is that there is a tremendous amount of leverage in the systems that is at risk of not being refinanced - that is certain.

So here's where we can all stand to benefit from decentralized autism: for those of us that don't have a bloomberg terminal, where can we find:

1.) SEC filings or a database that compiles maturity dates for high-yield bonds that have been issued in the past 1-5 years? We're looking for high-yield bonds (BB+ or lower) that have maturity dates within the next 1-6 months. With that information, we can assess the balance sheet of at-risk companies and evaluate the overall leverage that company currently has. 

2.) Where can we find a database or SEC filings detailing the Credit Default Swaps associated with those maturing bonds and what firms issued those CDSs?

The play: 

A. buying deeeeep OTM puts with 6+ month expirations for the companies that have significant exposure to maturing bonds. 

B. Buying OTM puts on the firms responsible for insuring those bond defaults.",2020-03-13 18:58:53

Except one thing – pharmaceuticals.  Actually they’re going to buy a lot more of them because Corona needs a lot of treatment.   But they'll also still need the stuff they're already buying, and there's less supply now.

[India has suspended exports of a lot of drugs, including antibiotics, and vital, difficult-to-make ingredients (API’s).](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/04/global-supplier-india-curbs-drug-exports-as-coronavirus-fears-grow.html) The other main producer of these drugs and API’s is China.  They seem to be slowly recovering and I hope they do, but I expect they won’t be exporting much medicine for a while.

Teva makes over 2,000 drugs, along with API’s.  They make the whole range of drugs, including mental health drugs which many of you take or should be taking.

**The good:**

* Teva is one of the only reliable suppliers of a lot of drugs that are or soon will be in desperate shortage around the world. A bottle of antibiotics that costs them \~10 cents to make will be the difference between life and death for a lot of people (Corona secondary infections, plus normal antibiotic usage); potential for big margins   
* Their facilities are mostly in Israel, the US and Europe, with only a minor facility in China and one in India.  [They do not expect any material supply disruptions](https://www.tevapharm.com/news-and-media/latest-news/update-on-COVID-19/).  They pay attention to supply chains and manage supply risk ([see 10-K, 3 weeks ago](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/818686/000119312520044221/0001193125-20-044221-index.htm); if they had any risk from Corona they could put a paragraph in there and cover their ass from lawsuits, but they didn’t.  That’s a strong signal)
* When a Corona vaccine/treatment is found, even though Teva probably won’t invent it, I think they’ll be involved in producing it – the whole world will need it ASAP and Teva is a huge % of global pharma production capacity
* After Corona fucks off and all is well, everyone will realize that it’s a good idea to have a stockpile of the drugs you need to live, so Teva should have strong sales, even at high prices
* [Some US politicians are calling for on-shoring production of antibiotics etc.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/business/economy/coronavirus-china-trump-drugs.html) Building that up from scratch would be very expensive.  Teva has a lot of IP and know-how that they could license (or Teva could just build more factories in the US)

**Some of the reasons why the stock has gone down from $60+ a few years ago:**

* The past few years – they’ve been dogged by lawsuits, especially opioid-related.  (They didn’t promote opioids like Purdue, they just made the generic, but that’s enough to get sued)  They also have some patent litigation etc., which they’ve taken reserves against and which are well-known in the market (read the 10-K for details).  Maybe helping to save the world will get them some goodwill and help them out here
* The past week – because the market is stupid.  It’s risk-off and deleveraging right now, so everything gets sold, even companies that actually benefit from the situation driving the sell-off
* Another theory on this past week – oil prices have crushed shale/fracker bonds, and that spread to all kinds of corporate debt.  Teva has debt; I think the algos see high volatility in their debt and feed that into their model for the stock price, which makes the stock look riskier.  But 1) most of their debt is not due for years, 2) their debt is no riskier than it was last week (and maybe less risky than ever), and 3) it seems likely that Fed/government help is on the way for corporate borrowers
* Another reason it went down is because I bought it.  On Wed I sold Tesla puts to buy it.  So obviously Tesla tanked the next day and so did Teva   

You should do your own research of course.  But the above was good enough for me, I have shares and calls.",2020-03-13 15:51:25
DD,Autistic DD / TA and big brain play. SPY 80p-180p and UPRO hedge,41,fhyc2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhyc2q/autistic_dd_ta_and_big_brain_play_spy_80p180p_and/,35,1584128635.0,"**TL:DR** Buying shares in UPRO to hedge against far otm SPY puts 180p - 80p that i'm gonna buy after fed meeting. 1k in UPRO = 1k in far otm spy puts after fed meeting.

This is some big short type shit, which may seem hard to believe because of how far we've already fallen, but listen.

We've fallen 27% from our ATH in SPY to our most recent low. That's a hell of a fall, but we haven't even gone back to the lows of december 2018. If this virus is an actual problem (which it will be), and lasts any length of time (which it will, vaccine 1yr or further away according to anyone that matters) then this makes no fucking sense.

Look at the vix. We've reached a peak 76, when in 2008 it peaked at 96. Obviously 2008 was much worse but let's continue, the point is this isn't an unprecedented level of fear. One thing to note is VIX peaked and we continue to go lower for a little while after.

The only times we've convincingly gone through the 200 weekly moving average, was during 2008 and the dot com bubble bursting. We've just now gone through the 200 wma and things haven't even shut down yet. What happens when people don't go out for 2 months or more?

If you haven't been under a fucking rock then you know that the velocity of this 'crash' is crazy. We've never gone down this fast, and markets tend to overshoot the bottom. We'll often go much lower than makes sense, and spike back up from that point, continuing to slowly go up from there. I believe based on the velocity that we have already seen, that we will overshoot the bottom even harder than normal for a relatively short time.

On SPX the next testing points are 2100/1800/1600/800 assuming we continue lower from here. What stops us from going lower? Well in the short term, it's government response. In the long term, it's just time. Enough people getting infected, vaccine development, etc. Businesses aren't gonna have no traffic for 6 months, but there's nothing that can be done about them having close to 0 traffic for 1-3 months.

Before today Spy 80p jun 19 puts were $0.15 each. After today's bounce they'll be much cheaper, and if i'm right, then after congress comes together with whatever shit they have & the fed meeting, they'll be even cheaper. Stupid people will think everything's fine. Volatility will shit the bed (relatively) and the options will be even cheaper.

Now some basic math. UPRO hit $80 at its ATH. 32.75 right now, which means there's about a 144% increase from here back to ath. The best part, is it's volatility proof. Your call won't get fucked by volatility plummeting into the earth. You'll just print money. I know 144% isn't a lot for gains posting autists here, but most people posts gains one day and then $ROPE when they lose it all. I don't sell nor invest in companies that sell ropes so I have no interest in doing it.

Here's how it breaks down

Let's say we buy $1000 of far otm spy puts that will go to 0 unless we continue to crash. You hedge (I know foreign concept for most of you) against it with $1000 in UPRO shares. 144% upside back to ath if we have a V recovery, and massive, massive downside potential with the puts (can't give % because it depends on the price. Fed bounce might just bring 80p down to close to $0.01, hard to guess)

$1000 far otm spy puts jun 19

$1000 upro shares.

**V recovery?** You make up for your loss on spy puts with the gains on upro.

**Move sideways after fed bounce?** You eventually make up the money from upro shares. No time decay no volatility crush, you're safe.

**Continue to crash after bounce and people actually get panicked? (80+ vix, testing 2100/1800)** Your puts print more money than the fucking fed partly thanks to vol boost. AND you keep your fucking upro shares which will eventually end up back to ath (even if it takes year+)

I'm normally retarded but this feels like the autistic trade of the year and i'm trying to find a reason not to do it. I doubt i'll think of one so i'll post ss when I make the position.

DD,BA will lower/suspend its dividend,88,fhxka4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhxka4/ba_will_lowersuspend_its_dividend/,79,1584124304.0,"They're bleeding out $1 billion/month.

BA needed to engage an entire syndicate of banks to gather a $12 billion term loan facility to make ends meet (you don't do that kind of shit if you have cash on hand).

One of those banks was JPMorgan Chase, [who just downgraded their outlook for Boeing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jp-morgan-abandons-boeing-buy-093927182.html ""who the fuck does that to someone they just lent 12 billion dollars?"")


~~Their common stock float is 5,061,000,000 (five billion shares).~~

Stupid fucking Yahoo finance data derived; actual float is 563.15M

They typically pay $2 per share per quarter, meaning they'll have to depart with ~~10~~ 1 billion dollars per quarter to keep the dividend steady.

If the Max 8 is not approved by the FAA on or before Thu 07 May 2020 (the next expected ex dividend date), BA will blow ~~almost all~~ over 4 billion (one third) of its credit line on the dividend issuance (dividend issuance + three months of bleed out) 

I expect their dividend to be cut in half (minimum), in line with the expected Fed's additional 50 basis point cut that will take the risk free rate, effectively, to zero.  This will buy BA somewhere between two to three quarters before things really start to go off the rails, potentially producing a GE-like outcome.",2020-03-13 14:31:44

Currently the situation is pretty bad for economy. But this is based pure speculation.

The percent of people that have the coronavirus is beyond low in Canada and Mexico even though the U.S. has seen an explosion in the number of people that have it. Logically speaking. There should be more. Travel from other North American countries make up 54% of the travelers to the U.S.. Meaning likely it is only a matter of time before Canada and Mexico realize the virus they have on them. If like Iran they really check into the numbers of people who get it, 

Even though people are talking about how much money the airlines and cruise ships lose to Asia and Europe being shut off, they'd almost worthless if they couldn't do anything in North America. Now all Cruise lines have already done this. But airlines haven't. And the probability of the U.S. closing off the rest of North America seems farfetched at first. But hear me out, see Trump ran on stopping people from Mexico from coming into the U.S. most overstaying immigrants use planes. He could 'fulfill' his campaign promise by stopping travel between the borders. Or it could be like India where people will likely never be tested until the entire virus has spread through the entire country so that numbers are low.

Mexico is 60th out of 191 for their health system. Meaning they're decently developed to the point where they should be testing a LOT more people. Could we see a restriction between the U.S. and the rest of North America? Well it would likely hurt Trump in the end as it would undoubtedly ""crash"" the market as that's far riskier than banning travel from Europe and Asia. But this President thinks that the faster he gets a 'cure' the better we'll rebound because of his 'little' chat with wall street execs. So he will more than likely stop travel from America and the North America because no one thought he'd stop travel from Europe, but he did.

Next would be the coronavirus and if it killed the president. idk even if he did get it, all likelihood they'd keep it secret. But because of his poor diet, and lifestyle, he could potentially kick the bucket if infected. And because of that, we could see a farther drop. It seems like prominent people being affected has little to no effect on the market though. I mean like people from Tom Hanks to Justin Treadue's wife(meaning he likely got it assuming they have a 'holy' relationship). I mean logically speaking, unless it's who's has 'extreme' power over markets like Trump, or Powell we'll be see no change in the market.

Next is speculative quarantine, other people in this subreddit have cited the possibility of cutting off states and counties that have major virus problems. But, this will likely not be done by the president. But rather by governors. Trump wants people to still go to his golf courses and because their located in the most populated states in the country. He won't be cutting them off. He didn't do that for European countries that have his properties and because of that he'd be unlikely to do it to California, New York, Florida, New Jersey, D.C., Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. Notice that these are the states that are seeing the largest growth with virus at the time. It might get worse because of that and even so he won't do anything. Next is governors closing off parts of the state. In my opinion is unlikely as they seem content with just listening to the government. So in my opinion no forced quarantines in the U.S. but rather DIY quarantines that the government is pushing.

Schools are closing already and there's nothing the president can do to really help or stop the process. Once all the top schools were switching online, the rest are gonna follow so they can stop from paying a bunch on health insurance.

Next is to consider just how much tourism Disney creates. I am not alone in saying that the mouse has captured the hearts of many 'fools' into believing they have the happiest place in the earth. And you likely know people that have passes to Disneyland, people who want to go to all the Disneyland's/worlds. People fly to Florida and California just for Disneyland. It is possible that the underlying problems with Disneyland closing could have a bigger impact than people realize. 

Will cases spike? Not if the government keeps quiet. The only reason number are so low is because of how inefficient the U.S. health system is. Italy is 2nd the world for their health service which is why they are likely able to test so swiftly and efficiently. I'm not saying there's a cover-up but..  it's pretty bad right now. People in the U.S. don't like paying medical fees so they skip seeking medical health which is why cases could spike but it could also just contain the 'number'. Which do I believe is more likely? The later. We could also that unconfirmed cases may be exponential but we'll probably never know about it until after they're dead.

The oil price war can't really get much worse, the only thing I can think of is Russia moving to lower prices even further because they can just use natural gas. But because of U.S. embargo's, it won't be really effective as they'll be just selling to China, India, and such. But even if they did that. Russia can survive the price war because they don't really care, as they're more focused on building up their sales of natural gas. So because of that I see the oil war being the same until either the U.S. attempts to leverage something on the Saudi's to force them to the negotiation table or that they'll willingly go themselves.

Will this scare the consumer, all things say yes. Which is why we're at where we are right now. The stock market has been pushed up based on the promise of a trade war ending and what a stock's future price will be. Even though we're officially in a bear market. I would really call it that. We're here because we're reaccessing the future of industries and how they're gonna survive in Coronavirus world. The fact is the market was propped up to fast and too much even though we had trade wars and crap to deal with. People were paying 3 weeks back for a stock's value after his temper tantrum turned war was to end. The market was propped too high and we're about to feel consequences. As short as it likely will be.

The human mind forgets easily. Ebola only lived in our hearts because of the memes it created. Likely the coronavirus will do the same. Once it becomes a full on meme, people will go shopping again. So the best way to see whether or not the market is about to return is what kind of Coronavirus memes Reddit is making(totally logically)

TLDR- buy more airline puts and wait for Mexico cases to blow up for Trump to put travel restrictions on Mexico. More puts on DIS too, and we're in a correction sort of cause the market was way overvalued anyways",2020-03-13 11:50:23

Shit is about to get real in Europe, people only started taking this seriously today. 

***What is to be expected:***

Massive exponential growth of cases in the next weeks (peak expected for 2nd or 3rd week of April)

Lots of companies already planning layoffs, some already started

A massive amount of corporations (Huge, listed companies from sectors such as banking and insurance) do not have enough laptops or I.T. staff to setup remote work for most workers. There is not enough stock of laptops and suppliers are **filled to the brink** with orders from multinationals.

Supermarkets are now starting to run dry and limitations of items per person should come in soon (not lack of supply, just overblown demand)

There is already a bunch of groups developing DIY ventilators for both hospital and private utilisation. Veterinarian ventilators + army equipment + private healthcare have been requested (not yet by law) to be made available for  public hospitals. (If you have technical knowledge please join @ [https://panvent.blogspot.com](https://panvent.blogspot.com) ).

Army Labs are now producing both test kits and pharmaceutical supplies.

Our strategic reserves are already being tapped into.

The USA will face **severe difficulties** dealing with this being that no meaningful measures have been taken and they will take quite awhile to be effective (just look at Italy and they are not at peak yet)

TLDR:

Buy puts. Buy some food (responsibly), isolate as much as possible from high-risk persons (including your family) and make sure your circle of friends and family understand the seriousness of the matter and what it will cause in hospitals (anarchy, basically).",2020-03-15 05:20:22

Today he went to a small village where the hugged and kissed everyone (including a small girl, so now they're even accusing him of being a pedophile).



The real problem with the amount of cases that have been confirmed by the government is that there's been nearly no tests done to the population. According to [data](https://i.imgur.com/6wWVdl9.jpg) from 2 days ago, Mexico has only tested 3 people for every 1,000,000.

DD,AMT - American Tower Corporation - Overvalued & Heavily Levered,9,fiqr2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fiqr2v/amt_american_tower_corporation_overvalued_heavily/,17,1584253401.0,"AMT is a REIT that operates wireless and broadcast communications real estate, including wireless towers and distributed antenna systems. It is one of the leading owners and operators of telecommunication towers in the U.S., India, Africa and Latin America. One interesting fact is the bulk of its towers are located overseas, but the company still generates the majority of its revenues in the U.S.

Over the past few years, this stock's growth has greatly benefitted from the rise in spending on the wireless carrier infrastructure. As companies invested in more leases for towers this REIT stock's price boomed into a bubble. Going forward though, the outlook is super grim now that COVID-19 is taking widespread effect in the USA which AMT heavily relies upon.

Many analysts have lowered or cut their outlook and shifted towards a HOLD or sell rating.

When it comes to insider transactions there's nothing but steady dumping for the past few months. Their EVP & President, multiple directors, SVP of Finance, EVP Chief Admin & more have steadily sold millions in shares since Oct.

Investment Thesis:

AMT operates within the tower business. This tower business is very capital intensive, and returns are typically not good unless or until the tower provider can secure multiple tenants on the tower, a feat made more difficult for a competitor by the limited pool of potential customers. In the U.S., for example, the big four wireless service providers generally make up about 90% of the segment's revenue.

With COVID-19, global supply chains have been disrupted and people have been quick to discount the value of companies affected such as Apple, Microsoft, and the like of many tech companies are down at least 20%+. However, the long ripple effect that will be displayed has yet to be fully priced in when companies cut their spending levels.

For example, many wireless carriers are being forced to push back on 5G expansion plans. Earlier this month, Mobile World Congress 2020 was canceled — a tradeshow where new smartphones are introduced and where deal-making goes on. This is problematic when AMT earns only a 3% return per tower when there is only one tenant.

The International Data Corporation (“IDC”) updated its projections on IT spending showing growth dropping rapidly. Basically, this market research firm expects corporates to further reduce or postpone their non-essential technology investment plans.

The Sprint & TMobile merger creates another reason for there to be reduced demand for wireless towers, as Consolidation from four to three major U.S. carriers, and further consolidation internationally will reduce tower revenue as carriers eliminate redundant networks.

Overall, it is clear that these carriers begin to cut back on spending and less aggressive efforts to grow internationally. It will dramatically hurt the cash flows AMT is receiving.

Lastly, there is a long-term risk since American Tower perpetually controls only 31% of its U.S. land, leaving it largely subject to landlords and leases. Since American Tower owns its towers, changes in land control could be complicated and costly.

We can already see the stock is nearing financial distress levels. When looking at recent financial strength we can see it on a steady decline. The Current Ratio has moved from 0.81 in 17, to 0.51 in 2018, now to 0.47 as of Dec of 19. This is due to an increasing amount of leverage and debt the company is taking on to pay the operating expenses as it struggles to attract tower tenants. Currently, it has over $21b + of current debt which it will be unable to pay in a few months given the lack of cash flow it will have.

TL-DR: Slowing demand for wireless communications and data processing will hurt tower demand forcing American Tower Corporation to reduce its dividend as it faces a lower credit rating, higher costs of capital, all caused by its massive debt levels.

When this happens, investors will sell off the stock causing its price to drop dramatically in the upcoming few months.",2020-03-15 02:23:21

Private investors are buying 2.5x as much as they are selling. People think this dip is temporary and stocks are 'cheap.' This means that institutional investors are currently the ones creating this huge downtrend. It also recaps a lot of the information going around on r/wsb, about how this might be only the beginning of a new big recession and stocks could be going down much lower still.

My personal take: we might be in for a bounce the upcoming days due to huge amounts of private money entering the stock market, but I still believe in a huge continued downtrend in the next few weeks/months. Corona impact is huge, top officials in Europe are now admitting that 50% of people are going to get infected and the only valid option left is trying to increase the duration of the pandemic to spread out the pressure on the healthcare system. This will mean a LONG time untill life will return to normal...

Translation:

**Private investors smell chance during corona-dip: 'Invested milions of Euros'**

While a bloodbath is taking place on the stock exchange, Peter did something this week that goes against the market sentiment. He bought additional. And substantial too.

The former entrepreneur sold defensive securities such as bonds last week and bought back large amounts of shares. 'That involves a lot of money, millions of euros. I have learned that the stock market tends to exaggerate strongly; you should take advantage of that opportunity,' said the private investor, whose full name is known to the editorial staff.

**Blood through the streets**

This example does not stand alone, according to sources of Het Financieele Dagblad among banks, asset managers and stock brokers. There is panic in the financial markets, but Dutch private investors have not forgotten the stock market wisdom 'buy when blood flows through the streets'. Spokesmen for broker BinckBanck and private bank InsingerGillissen report that more shares are bought than sold, up to a factor 2.5 times as much.

Private banking director at InsingerGillissen Paul Balk: 'We saw some customers build up a lot of cash on the sidelines to look for extra risk. They do that in addition to the diversified portfolio that is already in their possession. ' Balk notices that the investor sees similarities with the credit crisis of 2008, and therefore panics 'much less'. ""And above all, I feel that many clients see the corona virus as something temporary.""

The question is, however, whether investors are now investing much too early.

Prices in Europe collapsed again on Thursday, despite stimulus measures by the European Central Bank. The Amsterdam AEX lost 10.75% of its value on Thursday, the largest loss in one day since 'Black Monday' on October 19, 1987. Prices also plummeted in the United States. On Friday, the AEX ended the day with a tiny plus, but that is nothing compared to the previous losses. Measured from the beginning of the year, investors in the AEX are looking at a loss of 28.4%.

**Social life disrupted**

Unprecedented measures against the spread of the virus are in force in the Netherlands and in many other countries. Social life is disrupted. And that worldwide. As of today, an entry ban applies to Europeans to the United States. Consumers are hoarding, also in the Netherlands.
""In principle, a virus outbreak is a temporary thing,"" says investment strategist Ralph Wessels of ABN Amro. ""But it is far from being said that this is the bottom of the market. If the spread of the coronavirus takes longer, the economic damage is also greater. A really severe recession has not yet been priced in. ”

**Share prices not in a straight line**

Moreover, prices seldom move in a perfectly straight line during a crisis. The low point of the financial crisis, which started in May 2008, was only reached on the stock exchange in March 2009. The AEX was then at 199.25 points.

'During the financial crisis, coordination and concerted action took place between governments and central banks worldwide. That was powerful and gave markets confidence. We don't see that at all now and that doesn't help sentiment either,' says Wessels. 'Everyone rolls over each other with measures. US President Donald Trump announces a tax cut without concrete plans and blames Europe for the corona infections in the US.'


**Central bankers**

The fact that even more money from central banks has not yet been able to reassure the markets is worrying. The support should also come from governments, such as Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra, who came out with his own variant of former ECB President Mario Draghi's famous statement 'whatever it takes' on Thursday. Hoekstra is prepared to lend a lot, because the national debt is still well below the maximum prescribed by Europe of 60% of the gross domestic product.

So that is still borrowed money. The world has been increasingly in debt since the previous financial crisis. Central bank policies put interest rates historically low and even negative. House prices went through the roof, companies that would otherwise never get an affordable loan obtained cheap and easy credit. And low interest or not, all that debt has to be paid back someday. Fears that 'ever' changes to 'never' were already visible on the markets this week. The corporate lending market, with a global reach of $ 13,500 billion, stalled on Thursday.

**'More emotion' with customers**

It doesn't seem to bother private investors. Bank employees also saw a significant increase in the number of transactions performed at ABN Amro and private bank Van Lanschot. At ABN, there was clearly talk of 'more contact from the customer, where more emotion was shown,' said a spokesman. The customer often wants one thing above average: get into the exciting roller coaster quickly.

Someone who also went against negative market sentiments is Tim Hulst, IT purchaser at insurer Univé. When the oil price plummeted on Monday as a result of the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, he saw an 'enormous opportunity'. He bought pieces of Shell for € 10,000. ""I see it as a long-term investment. We are going to need oil for a long time, meanwhile the dividend yield at this rate is excellent. Even if Shell has to cut the dividend. ""

**Many new investors**

Hulst was one of the many investors who caused a peak on the stock markets last week. According to investment trainer Hans Oudshoorn of BinckBank, there is even an unprecedented influx of new customers. 'The number of account applications now peaks, in recent days, up to a factor of ten compared to last year. I call it the Whatsapp indicator. Family and acquaintances inquire in Whatsapp groups about how to start investing, and now the time has come to get in cheaply. ' At the beginning of this month, a survey by the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) revealed that roughly one in six Dutch people invest.

**Very busy with brokers and asset managers**

The crowds caused problems for asset managers and brokers on Monday, the busiest trading day of last week. For example, Robeco Direct customers were unable to log in, and online broker DeGiro did not show current price information. At ING and BinckBank, customers were unable to trade at all for some time. According to ING, this was an 'unfortunate accidental' failure. As a result, day traders say they have missed out on thousands of euros in price gains.

But fear of loss is not haunted by the minds of investors like Peter, the former entrepreneur who says he has stepped in for millions. ""You shouldn't be too eager, but I'm more than 90% sure I'm going to make a profit. Possibly within one to two years. ”",2020-03-15 00:04:40

Aspiring autist says to buy puts on media companies, the drop is far from over. YOLO

&#x200B;

Digital Media is on the brink of collapse because its revenue sources are mostly fraudulent without these events.  The media spend on the ad campaigns for these giant sporting events make up a significant portion of a media operation's annual revenue, up to half of annual revenue in some cases. For example, March Madness is the Back-to-School event of the spring and each season another media company gets its slice of the advertising pie.  You can make your determinations on what the events are each month owned by which media companies that advertisers spend vasts amount of money to reach large audiences to hit forecast targets.  These seasonal-events are mostly directly-sold between the advertiser and the media company (publisher), and these deals have been sold for months (even years) and forecasted against.  These deals are the ones negotiated by salespeople making obscene amounts of comissions and still done through handshake at tradeshows that are being canceled as we speak, these large contracts are accounted for in every years budget; their budgets designed with them in mind.  Keep in mind the digital media that is sold during these events are different than the normal digital ads you see each day (display, search) that are sold 'programmatically' through ad exchanges and social media platforms which countless tech companies act as middle-man getting a piece of the advertiser's media spend, media companies will never make up the difference by trying to make up revenue in other channels, there's simply no replacement for these large-scale scheduled events.

&#x200B;

Simply put, Direct-sold campaigns are 'good' money because of direct relationship with the revenue source , 'Programmatic' campaigns are 'bad' money because money frequently gets stuck in the ad delivery chain.  Programmatic Ad Deals are 'bad' money because it is rife with ad fraud, and as the economy slows down the incentive to commit fraud on the open internet just skyrocketed. I wrote a [post about this a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/c08ppe/what_adtech_companies_are_selling_tech_that/er2z1v6/?context=3) to /r/adops autists. Fradulent ad inventory will only go up as the weeks pass, incentive increases and cost stays the same.  With no technology/solution in place to combat ad fraud these media dollars that were once guaranteed to be placed into the media company's pocket to pay everyone's salary is now completely unspent (or used to pay off gambling debts in the stock market) and smart Media Buyers will know it is not a good time to be spending on Digital Media.  This will have a rolling effect on the economy, without layoffs, we haven't seen anything yet.

&#x200B;

Who cares about digital ads? Banner ads are like fraction of pennies!  Digital Media is a super high-volume and  high-margin business where the cost is effectively zero and the values are made up so it deserves a lot of attention. Digital Media only maintains its profitability because these large scale deals act as a baseline to prop up the rest of the industry.  Recent news reports clearly show that Media Companies have lost their only 'real' source of revenue already, therefore shit is tanking on water and they are scrambling to look for ways to make up for the loss in their upcoming reports.  Salespeople are desperately finding ways to make up for lost commissions and it will only get harder when they're not able to make old-school face-to-face deals (that they're still so fond of them for some reason) due to travel restrictions and quarantine, and I'm certain many will fall into the trap of making fraudulent deals with bad partners that will never show up in accounts receivable in the coming months and get sick doing so.  Digital Media is the economic engine for all of the non-journalistic media companies, so when that market shrinks, the sites that run clickbait listicles wont survive because spending on digital media does not outpace the economic damage from COVID-19 which infects exponentially while the industry stagnates and sinks; it has no conceivable way of catching up.

&#x200B;

Sure, someone who thinks everything fine might believe that more people staying at home could mean more ad exposure, but what good is ad exposure if no one is going outside to buy cars?  Why spend ad money if no one is buying products? (and tbh, during lockdown do free-thinking Americans really need advertising to know what supplies we need?)

&#x200B;

Olympics, look how desperate Japan is trying to keep it going.  Olympics is the largest media event in the digital media industry, if it falls, then everything else goes in that sector.  Digital Media isn't the only industry that will crash and burn, this is just explaining how a virus outbreak leads to social gatherings being canceled, which adversely affects companies whose existence relies on consumers being told what to do with their money and time as consumers quickly become unable to do so as a virus infects and kills them

This is setting up to be a pretty obvious trade to me that has paid and will keep paying. 

TLDR 

Put Ratio condor 3:4 May 20th crude futures , April 16th puts , B 24.5 S 26  S 31 B 33

As of writing trade returns $4900 on $1600 

The DD 

March 5th - The genius leader of opec decides to move forward without Russia’s approval on production cuts . I would like to thank CNN for making me so up to date on the leader of Russia’s personality quirks , but this was clearly a slap in the face and would no doubt piss Vlad off. Enter shorts. Complete collapse the next day when Russia , to everyone’s surprise (wtf?) , doesn’t play ball. The issue is exacerbated by MBS taking a similar stance with not giving a fuck if oil hits the floor. 

March 13- a week into the tension , no retest of the $27 bottom yet. The bullish momentum is not there. The call market is much thinner than the puts which holds more weight in the futures/ commodities markets since they are derivatives of derivatives. We end the day with our fearless leaders misguided efforts , including showing our poker hand with the “ fill the tanks” line. 

Here’s the catch. We can take all the storage tanks we have , multiply by 50 , and it wouldn’t be a drop in the bucket to the Putin MBS combo. Add in the additional travel bans over the weekend  to reduce demand , and you have 2 reckless people acting on emotion who have been more or less disrespected from multiple fronts and now have trump openly taking about about how we plan to take advantage of them. 

I don’t see them playing ball. They have the resources to take the crude price as low as they please and hold it there for some time before it gets to painful. And we all know how it goes with the allah Akbar mentality , they may have a shit eating grin with $10 barrels. Someone needs to win this fight and there is several powerful Chess moves left on the board to this losers game. 

The TRADE

Gunna go full autist here , because I do see a floor given the nature of commodities it makes sense to me to cap the upside to lower cost. 

3:4 Ratio PUT condor

Buy to open 3 April 16 24.5 PUT 
Sell to open 3 April 16 26 PUT

Sell to open 4 April 16 31 PUT
Buy to open 4 April 16 33 PUT 

this with be entered at a $1630 debit and will return $4900 on expiration if crude is above $26 and below $31. Many points to take considerable profit early at a very wide price range and entered with positive theta. Also your still at a point of profit at expiration all the way down to $20 a barrelI, risk is to the upside but at a debit. I have open contracts on both the April and May futures and will roll the April’s to form the above position tomorrow at 5 pm. Godspeed

Friday power hour short-covering is certainly a thing in the past few weeks. How it affects Monday is not as straightforward. As you can see, Mondays open and close lower, except when a big dick green candle continued its momentum through Monday March 2. This Friday was a very big dick green candle. 

TL;DR: there is likely enough momentum for the green dick to push through Monday, but likely back to red/black by Tuesday, and red Wednesday, redder Thursday.

Notably **BOTH** the upward movements and the downward movements have been trending larger over time since the start of the crash.  Obviously this trend is unsustainable and it will stop at some point, but at the moment it looks full steam ahead into next week.

As a confirmation of this real possibility [look at the highest strikes for the VIX options that expire March 18th](https://imgur.com/jQ7T7Nx).  The VIX in all of history has never gone above 60 [*EDIT: Before last week*], but there is very real open option interest for next week (and so far next week only) for the VIX reaching as high as 130, i.e. more than 2x as bad as any financial crisis that has ever existed during the history of the VIX.  Obviously these are probably hedges as opposed to bets, but if you look at the numbers involved for open interest:

* 27,838 at strike 90

* 20,166 at strike 100

* 5,234 at strike 130

These are not ""on a lark"" hedges done because ""well it was cheap so I bought a few options.""  These are large numbers given how extreme the strikes are implying numerous significant market players believe that there is enough of a real possibility that next week will be history making crazy that they want to put down some non-trivial money on buying insurance against it.

""That's great retard but I can't read and wouldn't if I could.  Just give me the strike and expiry.""

Up and down next week harder and faster then your wife's boyfreind pounds the both of you.  Buy puts at the end of up days.  Buy calls near the end of any day where futures + cash market triggered at least one ""down"" circuit breaker between the two of them (preferably more than one to be safe, but one will probably suffice).

""Calls and puts on what, and what strike?""

It looks like it might not even matter on what ticker or what strike, anything that is not nailed down and is affordable (and isn't an inverse ETF you retard).  Timing on entry and exit of your positions will mater more then what garbage you bought (and its all garbage right now), and timing will be getting down to almost twitch reflexes pitting you against the HFTs while any sane individuals will just check out of the market completely and wait for the dust to settle.",2020-03-14 20:45:58

##News flash retard, that’s not the timeline.

Buckle the fuck up because I’m about to learn you some shit. 

The point of social distancing is to slow the spread of the virus so that hospitals don’t get overloaded at once, but the current timeline on the plan is **one year or more.**

I’ll say that again for the people in the back.

#That is *one year* of public quarantine. 

This isn’t Mickey getting a quick dip in profits. This is the mouse losing **80% of his revenue sources for the next 12 months.**

Yeah, we are. But that doesn’t mean we won’t have a quarantine in effect, it just means we’re going to see a MASSIVE spike in cases as soon as we start actually testing. 

The thing about Beer Flu is you’re infectious as soon as you catch it, and young adults often don’t show symptoms **at all.**

##This means thousands of Typhoid Marys are wandering the country spreading this shit faster than that 0-symptom virus you made in Plague Inc. 

So what happens when we finally start testing and our numbers skyrocket?

First off, mass panic as tens of thousands of infected people who don’t even need treatment flood hospitals that are already over capacity, taking attention and resources away from immunocompromised patients that do. The news plays off this fear and people finally start to realize they should take it seriously as dead grandmas rain from the sky. 

We still do social distancing. But there’s far more panic than before, and we all know what the market does during mass panic.

Warrants when exercised dilute the outstanding shares. 27mil warrants when exercised should increase the outstanding shares by 13.5mil (0.5 factor) which is about 6-7% increase.

DD,Immunodeficient Marriott ($MAR) Tests Positive for COVID-19,171,fjdbqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjdbqf/immunodeficient_marriott_mar_tests_positive_for/,67,1584353805.0,"*TL;DR: $MAR has been stockpiling record levels of debt to facilitate share repurchases in an environment where their operating cash flows are materially declining, all while insiders are liquidating shares before Kung Flu drives the business into insolvency.*  **My plan:** ***Wait for the Donald Pump on Wednesday and buy discount puts ($MAR $60p 7/17) in preparation for a bloodier-than-already-priced-in Q1 earnings release on 5/8/20.***

While the hospitality industry has slid monumentally over the last two weeks, I don’t think we’ve hit a bottom and believe there is still significant exposure on the table, particularly for Marriott ($MAR). I pulled together some key fundamentals below and combed through the most recent earnings release transcripts to understand how COVID-19’s recent impacts on RevPAR (Revenue Per Attended Room) within the Chinese markets can be extrapolated more broadly across Western Europe and the United States. Fortunately, $MAR’s Q4 earnings call was on Feb. 27 and there were loads of analyst questions regarding COVID-19 so there were a few nuggets and anecdotes:

1.RevPAR is a common metric used when evaluating the health of a hotel chain. In 2019, $MAR’s RevPAR index accelerated +200bps which they coined “impressive”. Fast forward to February 2020 where they noted RevPAR at $MAR hotels in Greater China area declined 90% YoY. At the end of 2019, there were 375 properties across Greater China and as of 2/27, 90 were still closed entirely. In the broader Asia Pacific region excluding Greater China, (“APEC”), February RevPAR declined 25% YoY.

February RevPAR for the entire Asia Pacific region including Greater China has decreased 50%.

The scary part: Per Arne ($MAR CEO), “*we estimate roughly $25 million less in fees and EBITDA per month as compared to our 2020 base case*.” The entire Asia Pacific region only represents 16% of $MAR’s global rooms. While China contained the virus by welding apartment doors shut, we’re still running around in our beer goggles tongue-punching bar flies and shouting MAGA while bumping uglies at O’Hare on our way back from the $99 RT flight to Milan (RIP Norwegian). So $25M/month… for only 16% of the business.  That's $156M/month for the rest of the world which will eat away at $MAR's operating profit and could raise questions about their ability to pay on their massive pile of debt obligations.

2. Unless you live under a rock, you’ve deduced that people aren’t traveling for the NCAA tournament, nor attending any professional sporting events, national conferences, or music festivals (i.e. SXSW). As a result of said shit storm, all hotel conglomerates reneged on their original 2020 guidance… **except for one: $MAR**. Share prices for Hilton and Hyatt slid 40-60% (since 2/21) with significant drops on the days of their respective announcements. It’s only a matter of days before $MAR pulls their guidance. Once that happens, expect another slide.

3. Compared to their competitors, $MAR carries a significant amount of long-term debt relative to operating cash flow and their Debt:Equity ratios have negatively and wildly accelerated over the last four quarters while their competitors have remained flat. Look at this madness:

https://preview.redd.it/u7fxfivozxm41.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f4d72f4e67adf5af86353d07750bcfdd143bd74

4. To pour more gas on this fire, $MAR’s 2019 YoY cash flow from operating activities actually decreased relative to their competitors during the last two years, begging the question why their stock has performed so well, increasing from $115/share at 12/31/18 to $151/share at 12/31/19 (+31% YoY).

https://preview.redd.it/iftzbpi01ym41.png?width=443&format=png&auto=webp&s=af3b60eb52b9e1e2e65f3bfbbb0a146b686cd14e

5. What is $MAR doing with all this debt? Let’s take a look at the share repurchase activity over the last four quarters. In FY19, Marriott repurchased $2.25 billion worth of shares (more than Hilton, Hyatt, and Host combined) thus increasing the value of their share price and providing a perfectly ripe opportunity for insiders to cash out shares before shit really hits the fan.

https://preview.redd.it/c6euzlo11ym41.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e01b579184635d8a9427adc7628bd46e4a172d5

6. Open Market insider trading (excluding routine acquisition/disposition) volume in the T6M period is startling. Marriott saw 0 insider shares purchased and 143K shares sold by 9 different members of senior leadership. While the Hyatt number is equally staggering, >90% of the shares sold were done by 1 “company”.  Also, 100% of Host’s insider shares sold were by 1 person – Richard Marriott.

In summary, throw down some cash on puts and watch these babies print after $MAR has a colossal dumpster fire of a Q1.

TL;DR - Scroll the fuck up.

Shoutout to the scammers for getting WSB to return to public. But I realized I can no longer be a lurking autist - I need to share with the rest of you 🌈🐻 & 🐂. 

My day job, besides waking up at 6:30am to trade (gamble) like a denigrate, is to advise startups and larger companies on international growth and expansion strategies across Europe and Asia. Needless to say companies are doing less, m&a has been postponed, customers dropping off the map... something I haven’t seen posted yet is venture money drying up. I’ve heard from two clients last week alone they’ve been told by the Andreessen Horowitzs and Sequoias that they won’t be writing any checks for the rest of the year. That’s FUCKING a lifetime for startups. No joke this couldn’t come at a worse time, as many startups are trying to translation from being growth focused to profitable focus. 

You can’t simple flip a switch to become profitable, it takes time. It was already hard for series A and seed companies to raise last fall. It’ll be impossible now for them and I’d imagine the series B&Cs will struggle now too. Expect lots of startups to go out of business over the next year. It’ll be a blood bath and that makes me think about all of the companies that service startups. It’s gonna get rough for Silicon Valley Bank ($SIVB) for sure, but I’d imagine depending on the failure rates you might see dents in AWS and Azure profits too. Where else could this spread? Idk I’ll try to dig up more between gambling everything on SQ puts.

Now, with current rate cut, similar to dot com crash, we are seeing market destabilize even further (ref Futures). With people not making money and needing it for expenses etc, there will be more credit overextension due to inability to pay back (defaults) as well as even larger selloffs. 

The current situation
Currently due to not having liquidity in the market, Fed is trying to subsidize this part however there’s a problem, they are trying to buy back equity and governments mortgage backed securities. 
The problem
1. People will default on mortgages
2. Buying back it’s own securities will still plunge the market. 
3. After the defaults, CDAs or whatever they are called now are going to get downgraded.
There was another post about how we have 3x more junk bonds compared to 2008 crash (600s vs 1800s) once that happens, you’re sitting on worthless pile of shit that used to worth something. Now banks default and fed is raped .... 2008 all over again but with Corona Twist 

Result :
A fucking annihilation worse than 2008 crash, something closer to Great Depression if not worse.
Govies are trying to start buyback in next few weeks. If those things begin to happen, puts all the way to SPY $150 exp May or Early June. The fed will basically be sucking itself off in order to keep the market afloat, since fed isn’t flexible that won’t last and puts will print

i. Hard to have business-as-usual if kids aren’t in school

1. An upturn in transport stocks (when goods are being shipped again)

First off, I'm not a fearmonger, I simply gather information from respected and highly educated people and relay the information. I'm obsessed with epidemiology and disasters. I do have a college degree although I cant spell shit. This is my DD on our current situation.

The only way to slow this virus is exactly what china did. They were able to break the chain of contagion. They had a mandatory quarantine, everything shutdown completely. When someone got sick they didnt send them to their local dr. to infect others they went to a specialized place for screening separate from the public. There they would test them and have results within hours not days. If they were positive they went to a holding facility where they were monitored and road out the virus. They weren't concentraion camps they were places where they could stay and be monitored and most importantly be prevented from infecting others. Most cases were mild and didnt require special care. If they did get worse only then were they were taken to the hospital. Only after the were recovered did they go back go their families. If this seems extreme its because it is. Extreme diseases require extreme measures. Even as well as they did to contain this, it's still a major problem as most of their popularity is still at risk. Another outbreak could happen. They might not be back to normal for a long time.

Early Febuary, the US should have been building containment facilities, hospitals, working out policy, procedures and training people. They should have prepared for this. What we have here is a complete fucking shitshow. No preperation, no policy. No equipment, No fucking clue what they are doing. 

People who get sick here aren't being identified, tested and treated properly. Health workers dont have supplies, equipment and PPE that they need. Patients are being sent home to quarantine with their families if their condition is mild. There they will infect everyone they come into contact with and anyone who enters their house. A lot of people will need critical care and, overload our healthcare system, this could push the mortality rate even higher. We are going to have a full on disaster in this country like never seen before. You may have a spouse, child or parent die in your house and there will be no one to take the body. Our Healthcare system will be completely and utterly paralyzed. You might call 911 and get no answer. Stores could be looted. We could be digging mass graves in a mater of weeks. 

If this seems frightening its because it is. We going to be on our own with minimal support from our government and hospitals because they didnt take this fucking shit seriously and instead made jokes about it on twitter. Unless extreme action is done now 50-70% of the population will be infected, millions will die. Be prepared to be on your own for quite some time once shit hits the fan. 

So there it is, this is what's going to happen if trump and his cronies keep talking and don't do anything. If next week goes by and we don't see any preparations, just talks about the market and how few people died, then prepare for the worst. 

The economic disaster is more uncertain. Without major support small and medium business with no revenue for months could go bankrupt, defaulting on thier credit lines, banks will fail, millions unemployed. People will run out of money quickly and overcharge their credit cards, take out all of their 401k. Mass panic and hysterics will be rampant. The US may default on thier debt, the worlds economy could fail. It may be years before we recover. This isnt a disaster movie this is a real possibility if the feds dont take the right action to prevent this catastrophic failure. I dont know about you but I'm not feeling to confident in our leaders and am slightly bearish.

Good luck to you all.

DD,Liquidity issues in the MBS and Treasury Markets,93,fjbnab,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjbnab/liquidity_issues_in_the_mbs_and_treasury_markets/,32,1584346905.0,"Alright Autists, Strikes up front EWU 17 4/17p, SPY 190 5/1p and EQZ 18 4/17p

&#x200B;

During today's Fed call, which I know half of you didn't listen to because WSB was down and were instead  buying $ROPE, they made a very important statement. This statement was that ""There have been liquidity issues in the MBS and Treasury markets.""

They further went on to explain ""Even during the Repo operations, we were not seeing the liquidity that we needed, and this is what spurred us to take action.""

This is a problem. The Treasury market is generally pretty useful for helping companies make payroll, help peg mortgage rates, and basically be a store of value.

When no one is buying treasuries, people start pulling cash out of the markets, and equities are instead sold instead of the treasuries. This leads to a decrease in price of equities, which is what we are seeing. This is why the fed has lowered the reserve requirements to 0 for the banks, and they have stopped doing share buybacks, because we need this stuff to continue churning along.

&#x200B;

The second part of this is MBS liquidity issues and in my opinion, is the smaller issue. If any of you tried to refinance last week, you would know that you are not getting quoted lower rates. This is because no one is buying MBSes. This caused interest rates to spike to over 4%, which is a problem for anyone wanting to buy a house. The reason the fed is buying them up is to lower rates for mortgages.

&#x200B;

\*\*So what does this all mean?\*\*

The fed, contrary to popular belief, is not trying to prop up the stock market. The fed is trying to propup the actual economy at this point with their actions. This isn't necessarily a problem, however the issue is that if this continues, the Fed will run out of ammo, or worse, no one but the Fed is putting money into the system. This creates a cyclical effect where everyone is trying to get out at the same time, and you get crashes.

If the fed either starts buying equities directly, or starts buying treasuries themselves, you have yourself your flag to go all out on puts at that point.

Alright hoes, a lot of my imaginary friends have been asking me whether or not they should get into energy stocks while they are laughably low. As a true WSB'er, I wanted to tell them to buy puts and fuck off but as a friend I felt an obligation to say google it and fuck off instead.

The future of oil is a politically critical matter for the global economy and the US specifically because of its dominant position in the shale oil industry. The Permian Basin and Bakken oilfield madness has been around for quite a bit now but as far as I know the **cost of production of shale oil varies anywhere between $40 and $90 per bbl** , with $40 being an extremely lucky scenario. Considering what happened to oil this week, most, if not all, shale oil producers are forced to tuck their cocks back in their undies and sit quietly. Just look at this:

* Occidental Petroleum will cut and spending by 32 percent.
* Murphy Oil will cut spending by 35 percent
* PDC Energy will cut spending by 20-25 percent
* Matador Resources will cut rigs in half
* Chevron said it is considering cuts to spending
* Marathon Oil will cut by more than 20 percent
* Apache is eliminating all of its rigs in Permian

**Any price below $40/bbl means brutal cost-cutting for those companies and definitely significant layoffs. As of right now, WTI is traded at $31.47 per bbl **.  According to Morgan Stanley, the industry needs $51 per barrel just to fund their capex budgets this year, let alone pay off debt or send money to shareholders.

Now, what can we expect from oil prices in the nearby future? Well, here it really comes down to speculations but I just wanted to clarify a few moments.

1. At this time, Russia is perfectly positioned to engage in an oil price war for several reasons:
 * They have been stashing significant amounts of money over the past 5 years to build up a solid financial cushion to sustain long-term budget cuts. They can sustain about 8-10 years of tight spending.
 * Putin just re-established himself as a czar of Russia and the coronavirus is a perfect excuse to ban any sort of protests as a measure of protection. This will, of course, be enforced militarily just like it has been for the past 10 years.
 * America is on a pace (in my opinion) to become one of the most infected places on this planet due to its extremely weak (or non-existent maybe?) actions in regards to testing and controlling of the virus. USA will be forced to throw pretty much all of its resources to fight COVID.
* There might be no other such convenient opportunity for Putin to crush its American rivals. If the Russians are game, it's on.

2. Saudi Arabia also has a significant financial cushion and knowing how strict their government is, we know it will have absolutely no problem cutting back on social programs to sustain a price war. If I'm correct, they average cost of production of oil at **10 fucking dollars**. They have no problem pitching their oil at $25/bbl and play the waiting game.

If that happens, we may start seeing another wave of super mergers like we did in the 90s. Put all of the above on top of COVID destroying demand for oil and where does it take us? 

Right to the cock-sucking motherfucking PUTS!!! 🌈 🌈 

Also, don't forget that some major American banks are heavily invested in shale operators. Once those companies start drawing their lines of credit like Boeing did, some tits will go straight up.

Well, what's being overlooked is some companies that were already hanging on by strings are about to flat out drop to zero. Foot Locker is no exception.

Investment Thesis:

**How does Foot Locker get its revenue?**

That's right, shopping centers at malls. We all know with mass panic there isn't anybody out shopping right now. People are lucky if the stores are even still open because in a few week's time they won't be.

**Secondly, what attracts people to visit Foot Locker?**

The main driver of their sales is athletic footwear. However, most if not all professional sports are now canceled! -Major League Soccer is suspending its season immediately for 30 days due to the threat of coronavirus. The NBA has canceled its season. March madness is canceled. NHL season is postponed. All of this is awful news for the store because even after the virus goes down, people sure as hell aren't going out to buy sports sneakers.

**Lastly, what are the other headwinds being overlooked?**

What's really going to nail the coffin on this dying company is the pending trade deals and current tariffs that loom over the company. Sales are already declining, and this company produces its products almost entirely in China. People are ignoring the fact that phase 1 is simply the ""start"", there are so many problems that aren't going away anytime soon. People definitely are going Nike and Under Armor for better brands & prices.

**TL-DR:** Lack of access due to store closures, falling demand for athletic shoes, and tariff costs are going to run Foot Locker's failing business into the ground. Any Puts under $15 strike & after may 15th should print $$$",2020-03-15 22:58:54

* Oregon can currently test about 80 people a day.  Basically, we have no idea how many people are sick in the state.  But there has been multiple community spread cases and we have a elderly care facility overrun with the shit.  My guess is Oregon is \~6 days behind Seattle, WA.
* Oregon is sandwiched between Seattle, WA (north) and a 3.5 hour drive. And SFO, CA (south) a 2 hour flight.  Both of which are heavily infected with Corona Lung AIDS.
* Oregon case numbers are rising.

Intel and Corona Lung Aids

* Headquarters in Oregon
* Has their own damn jet that flys back and forth to SFO every day.  
* Has a shit ton of people that fly back and forth to Seattle, Washington to meet up with partners (Microsoft) every day.
* Before CLA (Corona Lung AIDS) Intel was having problems meeting their production goals due to 10nm ramp up issues for their processors. 
   * Basically, to dumb it down, your computer goes 'beep beep' because of Intel.  They were having problems getting the Beep Beep to your Autism machine.
* Intel has 14 Active Fab sites.  Where the Beep beeps are made.
   * 6 are in Oregon (About to hit the 'boom' for CLA)
   * 5 more are spread across the southern USA.
   * 1 in Ireland (shit show of CLA, Connor Mcgreggor's Aunt died for christ's sake!)
   * 1 is in China (strangely, the safest one?)
   * 2 are in Israel.  The place that was last to fall in World War Z

Fabs need humans to make the beep beep roll out.  Intel is already having problems meeting demand.

So what’s the point of all this? PTON is probably going to see a big spike in sales which at least in the long term is going to give them a boost in recurring revenue from app subs and bike sales from spastic beckies during the virus shutdown.

***Cashflow -> fooked like the Mayweather's***

***Defaults -> cumming faster then my first blowie***

***Economy -> get ready for the breadlines***

***Fed -> Powell, liquidity is my only hope.***

Whats up gay bears. Back with an update on the risk factors associated with corporate bonds and debt. I still have to rewrite my initial post as there was some terminology that was incorrect and picked up on by some astute autists, but the thesis fundamentals stay the same. The Fed is dumping liquidity like me after curry to make sure banks can pay out credit line obligations.

If we start to see corporate defaults on credit lines and loans, we are fuk.

So this issue of corporate debt apparently has been known about since, like, forever. By forever I mean 2017, but since we are all goldfish, thats a fucking century ago.

So lets talk about it.

So in the IMF’s global financial stability report in 2017, those nerds realized the rise in leverage among companies. Leverage being debt. These nerds came up with the warning that:

***“one lesson from the global financial crisis is that excessive debt that creates debt servicing problems can lead to financial strains”***

With that warning, it then leads to ask, do we have excessive debt? Well the answer is holy fucking shit yes. It’s like we gave every large and mid cap company an invitation to Uncle Sams credit card and they are pimping out for those Louis Vuitton shoes.

&#x200B;

Yes thats like 3 trillion in Baa debt. Baa debt being BBB. almost garbage, more like a red lobster type of garbage. Puts out its good, but then your shitting bricks next day.

So what happens when debts get downgraded? A fallen angel - wtf is that? A fallen angel is a bond that was initially given an investment-grade rating but has since been reduced to junk bond status.So basically its when someone fucks up so bad, the powers that be tell them they cant play in the sandbox anymore - and call them junk.

Well turns out almost 3 trillion in bonds are about to be angels that tripped and fall off the empire state building. That is, almost 60% of bonds are considered BBB. This means 60% of bonds are one grade from being junk, or fallen angels.

Well how often is shit downgraded? Well here's more crayons.

https://preview.redd.it/m3x53yo8trm41.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3cde5a24b74a78485fcf57e7a3cb3db60fb4f11d

Back in 2018, a Deustche did not expect this dynamic of bond degrading to be too much of an issue for 2019, when they had an outlook that the economy is still expected to grow, should there indeed be an economic slowdown/recession in 2020, then Deutsche warns that ***""the sheer volume of BBBs would become of much greater concern as we would expect rating trends to turn much more negative.""*** The bank also said: ***""the risk of a recession in 2020 (whether it materializes or not) will refocus minds on these types of issues as we approach and enter H2 2019”***

So basically they didn't give a fuck because bull gang was chillin in tendies city.

However the IMF recognized in their 2019 report that:

""In a material economic slowdown scenario, half as severe as the global financial crisis, corporate debt-at-risk (debt owed by firms that are unable to cover their interest expenses with their earnings) could rise to $19 trillion—or nearly 40 percent of total corporate debt in major economies—above crisis levels.""

&#x200B;

Well ok, thats Corporate debt, fuck the corporations - occupy 2020 right my dudes!?

Bernie 2020 gang gang.

Not quite, believe it or not, not only have corporations been swiping the Amex like a drunk cuban at 11 nightclub in Miami on a Saturday night, but insurance companies, governments, startups, and even goddamn Karen and my wife’s boyfriends kid is swiping that shit.

https://preview.redd.it/r01mv2xctrm41.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f8f6fe4908a830045f0a3392a224f6e3c58d84d

&#x200B;

So not only are corps leveraged up to the moon, everyone is. General governments, Karen, my god damn dogs got a line of credit for his kibbles.

Well why has everyone started swiping that sweet Amex?

Another study by the IMF in 2019 points out that:

***“Low yields, compressed spreads, abundant financing, and the relatively high cost of equity capital have encouraged a buildup of financial balance sheet leverage as corporations have bought back their equity and raised debt levels (as discussed in the April 2017 GFSR). This means that the share of lower-rated companies in major US, European, and global bond indices has increased. This trend of worsening credit quality also means that the estimated default risk for high-yield and emerging market bonds has remained elevated”***

Additionally,

***“Rapid inflation of asset prices has ensued as large output gaps necessitate an unusually protracted period of low-interest rates. This asset price growth has been accompanied by gathering strength in credit growth and rising leverage, the combination of which has facilitated strong financial expansion across several economies. Such financial expansions have generally been accompanied by less remarkable economic recoveries, leading to only slowly dissipating negative output gaps. This divergence creates a challenge for monetary and financial policies to support economic recovery while ensuring that medium-term risks do not build.”***

So not only has this positive inflationary period of prices led to indebtedness just to “keep up with the Jones”, but if we see any deflation of pricings shits gonna get more sticky then my jerk sock.

***“If aggregate demand determines the level of output, a contraction in demand by highly indebted households will not always be compensated for by an increase in demand by those that are less indebted, which may lead to a recession (Eggertsson and Krugman 2012; Korinek and Simsek 2016)...adverse shocks to highly indebted households, such as a reduction in the value of collateral, trigger borrowing constraints that lead to a deleveraging process that may further reduce the value of collateral. The presence of nominal rigidities, such as a zero lower bound for nominal interest rates or nominal wages that cannot adjust downward, amplifies the consequences of these shocks.5 For instance, adverse shocks to house prices (or stock prices) reduce homeowners’ equity in their housing assets (or households’ net wealth, respectively). If sufficiently large, this reduction could trigger large debt defaults and impose further downward pressure on house prices (or stock prices, respectively), leading to a debt deflation spiral (Fisher 1933), as Figure 2.2.6""***

https://preview.redd.it/k788x03etrm41.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=667439ca926d0fb75f11f9c9f2cc539aee05a99c

&#x200B;

Well, then where should we look to see defaults? Energy, my fucking industry of course. BBB energy debt is of course fucking bigger then Kai Greene on HGH. So long story short, watching these energy debts, we should expect to see downgrades in energy along with defaults coming shortly after.

https://preview.redd.it/x7u8pdsftrm41.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=558a4ebcb89871e90040afd31fc3dd3b0d38cfcb

&#x200B;

In general though, what leads to defaults in other sectors? How do you not pay your debt? You can’t make the payments. Why can’t companies make payments? They make less money. How do they make less money? Beer Virus halts their operations FOR AN ENTIRE QUARTER! (Go look at Carnival halting operations for 60 days)

So at the end of the day. An economic slowdown coming is going to absolutely pimpslap the shit out of debtors because they were loaning out way to much. Welcome to the shitshow, its just getting started.

DD,American Eagle Outfitters ($AEO) - Undervalued and Poised for an Aggressive Comeback,60,fjujc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjujc4/american_eagle_outfitters_aeo_undervalued_and/,68,1584429268.0,"AEO is on its 4th year of consecutive double-digit growth and is nowhere close to stopping. Currently undervalued at a 10-year low in price, creating an excellent buying opportunity for long-term investors.

**Previous Quarter:** When looking at the last quarter, revenue rose **6%** to **$1.31 billion** from $1.24 billion in the year-ago period. Analysts had estimated revenue of $1.27 billion. Consolidated comparable sales increased by **2%**.

**Full-Year Results:** When it comes to Fiscal 19, there is a **7% YoY growth** to reach 4.3B (4B in 2018). Same-store comparable sales are 3%. AEO has trended upward in the previous 5 years for comparable sales. This is quite an impressive feat given the weakness in brick & mortar retail due to e-commerce.

Overall the **5-year CAGR is 4.11%** for revenue. **$205M** has been returned to shareholders in 2019 from stock buybacks and dividends. EPS has steadily increased over the last 5 years mainly due do the stock repurchases. (6.3m shares rebought @ avg $17.74/share)

What's interesting is the fact the company has plans to repurchase another 35.4M shares by 2024.  Given their past history, it is likely they will take advantage of the low price and buy in the near term. Ultimately, this will **reduce outstanding shares by 21%.**

**Financial Position:** Currently, AEO has **plenty of cash** at $416.9M and no debt, making it in excellent financial health to weather any storm. Not only that, but the company also had $206M FCF after even spending $210.4M in CAPEX.

**Dividend:** Something that makes this stock highly attractive right now is it's 5.45% dividend yield. Unlike that of oil companies, AEO's dividend is safe. The plenty of liquidity and excellent FCF generation (more than 2x that of dividends) will ensure the dividend is paid even in a worst-case scenario of the coronavirus.

**Growth Opportunity:**  One promising star is the Aerie lingerie retailer which is rapidly stealing sales from a declining Victoria's Secret. AEO management is super confident about the growth & the past result are clearing showing it. For fiscal 2019, Aerie revenues came in at $818.6M compared to $645.7M, helped by 33 net new store openings and comparable sales growth of 20% for a total growth rate of 26.7%. There current plans to ramp up Aerie’s store opening plans for next year with up to 50 to 80 locations, including a number of new markets.

**Overall:** This company's **fortified balance sheet** & **strong FCF generation** will protect it through any short-term cyclicality.  The **excellent management team** & **fantastic growth** of it's growing brands will continue to provide solid returns. Lastly, the excellent 6% dividend yield & potential 15% earnings yield due to buybacks, make buying AEO an opportunity too good to be passed upon.

**TL-DR: Buy AEO Stock (highly likely to increase at least 10-30% in next year).** 

Reasons: Strong B/S, excellent FCF, Share buybacks, & approved dividends.

**Edit 1:**  Since everyone is asking about puts, I forgot to mention, it's only like $8 a share (meaning the most it can drop is $8 and it can go up UNLIMITED) So how's that for profit potential!",2020-03-17 03:14:28

[It's like a really shitty christmas tree](https://preview.redd.it/iofgjamut3n41.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=53bea2d1e598f4c1e6e2fb185515c9cc29068090)

&#x200B;

Why did they alone react so positively today to the talks of bailouts?

Well because AAL is absolutely fucked without it and is the most likely to benefit from an bailout. 

If we compare them to the other airlines they are severely over leveraged. 

&#x200B;

[Notice how much cash they have](https://preview.redd.it/edtblygnu3n41.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f07f029fa87c9094924d6c9281f60e573774afd)

They have less cash on hand than shitty ass Spirit airlines... Think about that... Spirit is 1/10th the revenue of AAL yet has 4 times the amount of cash on hand. AAL was bleeding already (look at Unlevered  Free Cash Flow.) I expect revenue to be close to 1/2 of what it was and free cash flow to be hit even more when you consider almost all of their profits come from lounges and bags.   


Also... Instead of burning down their debt they focused on stock buybacks. Fuck 'em for being stupid with their money. A bailout will not save this cluster fuck.

here is the law
https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2010/34-61595.pdf

which states (and more)
>SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is adopting amendments to Regulation SHO under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  We are adopting a short sale-related circuit breaker that, if triggered, will impose a restriction on the prices at which securities may be sold short (“short sale price test” or “short sale price test restriction”).  Specifically, the Rule requires that a trading center establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered security’s closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day.  In addition, the Rule requires that the trading center establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to impose this short sale price test restriction for the remainder of the day and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and disseminated on a current and continuing basis by a plan processor pursuant to an effective national market system plan.  We believe it is appropriate at this time to adopt a short sale-related circuit breaker because, when triggered, it will prevent short selling, including potentially manipulative or abusive short selling, 
from driving down further the price of a security that has already experienced a significant intra-day price decline, and will facilitate the ability of long sellers to sell first upon such a decline.  This approach establishes a narrowly-tailored Rule that will target only those securities that are experiencing significant intra-day price declines. We believe that addressing short selling in connection with such declines in individual securities will help address erosion of investor confidence in our markets generally. 

TL:DR calls or cash the next two days, then more pain, although looking at the list of companies that got put on the ban list on Friday, most were down a shitload today as well, so nevermind, who the fuck knows lol",2020-03-17 01:42:52

According to the UPRO and TMF prospectuses these funds suffer from severe volatility drag when volatility (the VIX) jumps to high levels:
https://imgur.com/a/tgXC6e9

So this portfolio is going to be massively red even if the stock market has a 60%+ annual return while VIX remains above 25-50. 

The reason behind this is simple, say we have several days of +9% gains, -8% gains, +9% gains:      
           
(1-.08)\*(1+.09)\*(1-.08)\*(1+.09) = 1.00560784x the starting portfolio value.  

Pretty break even for unleveraged long/short stock. 

However, when you have 3x **daily** returns these ETFs provide:       
        
(1-.08\*3)\*(1+.09\*3)\*(1-.08\*3)\*(1+.09\*3) = 0.93161104x the starting portfolio value.

UPRO is ETB at TOS. So if you can endure a few +- 30% days, *on a small portion of your portfolio*, you could come out with some good volatility drag gains shorting UPRO.

# TL;DR
Sell short UPRO alone or the Hedgefundies portfolio (UPRO/TMF) and wait, collecting some sweet volatility drag.",2020-03-17 01:18:06

Founded in 1999, the company owns  and operates Trip.com, Skyscanner, and Ctrip.com, all of which are  online travel agencies.*

TCOM is currently in dire straights much like a dog roaming the streets of Yulin, or much like a bat flying around Wuhan. During the bull run, TCOM was already the lesser known travel agency when compared to other sites like Google Flights/Expedia, however now with China being restricted not only on it's own end, but nearly every other part of the world as well, they are completely ass blasted.

TCOM's past earnings for the past 2 years have underperformed each time ranging from -2% forecasted earnings to -24%, this resulted in an average 8% drops the following day after EACH earnings reports (11/13/19, 09/09/19, 05/22/19, 03/04/19)

**The next scheduled earnings report for TCOM is on March 18 after hours.**

So I know you're all autistic and retarded but do you think it is even remotely possible for them to be profitable when their main source of income, is travel tourism?

**Note:** The bailout in 2008 was focused on banks and the financial sector (with the exception of autos), so performance can only slightly be compared. However, it is still interesting to see how the stock market digested this information.

**The Bailout:** The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, AKA the bank bailout of 2008, created the $700B TARP fund (Troubled Asset Relief Program) that enabled the purchase of toxic financial assets. Additionally, other Fed action took place over this time period involving providing liquidity to financial/money markets, and that is not included as information.

**A Timeline:**

\- **September 19 2008 (Friday):** $SPY close 124.12

\- **September 20 2008 (Saturday):** Legislation from Department of Treasury is sent to Congress seeking approval for $700B bailout.

\- **September 22 2008 (Monday):** $SPY close 121.31 (**-2.26% since 9/19)**

\- **September 29 2008 (Monday):** House of Representatives **rejected** the initial bailout bill, causing stock market to collapse. $SPY close 111.38 **(-8.18% since 9/22)**

\- **October 3 2008 (Friday):** $700B TARP fund is approved by the federal government. Includes Capital Repurchase Program targeting banks, purchase of preferred shares of AIG, and bailout of Big Three Auto Companies. $SPY close 110.34 **(-0.93% since 9/29)**

\- **October 6 2008 (Monday):** $SPY close 104.72 **(-5.09% since 10/3)**

\- **October 10 2008 (Friday):** $SPY close 88.5 **(-15.49% since 10/6)**

**Total Results over Bailout Discussion/Approval Period:**

Change in $SPY from 9/19 through 10/10: **$SPY -28.69% (nice)**

I really think this is *THE* play.

NOK recently set a record for transfer rates. 

These seem to be the lead candidates the US administration and EU are looking at to combat Huawei/China in the 5g space. 

There's a TON of protectionism in this market, because of cyber-security concerns, including rumours of encouraging/subsidizing an American company to buyout Nokia. 

5g infrastructure is pretty much set and in place, of which Nokia has the lions share of the US and Ericcson has a lot in Europe.

 But hardware doesn't make the money, LISCENSING does. And that should start rolling in soon, even ATT finally admitted their 5g is fake and the REAL 5g is coming now with the new gen of devices. 

For these reasons these are your best 2 bets to get in on this. Samsung is also a good play, but the cost is higher. Cisco is a shit play and an incompetent company who will find a way to miss out on this. UNLESS they buyout NOK (see above,) in which case NOK is still the better play.

Highly risk asymmetric bet, TSLA has a lot more downside, and very limited upside.

**1. Tesla business model exposed to virus shocks and oil shocks.**

Let’s run down Tesla’s core business operations and assess how fucked they are. (F for respect)

a) Tesla has a giga factory in Shanghai and supply chain in China. Remember how Tesla faced manufacturing hell in a stable business environment? You really think they are going to deliver when there are actual real life supply chain disruptions? F

b) Tesla sells luxury cars. What kind of normie is buying cars, never mind luxury cars in a recession? F

c) Tesla sells cars to China. A quick google search shows that China has been facing an auto recession for the past 2 years, beer bat flue sure as hell isn’t driving demand. F

d) Oil prices low. Why buy electric when oil is cheap AF? F

**2. Tesla overvalued.**

WSB has proved that the collective autism of its people has the power to shape reality.

Source: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/auto-bob-lutz-nobody-explain-tesla-250-percent-stock-rally-2020-2-1028905903](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/auto-bob-lutz-nobody-explain-tesla-250-percent-stock-rally-2020-2-1028905903)

Little does he know that WSB has managed to weaponize autism. 

In the past 6 months before the downturn on Feb 21, TSLA up (+266%), versus SPY up (+12%). 

And since the start of the bear market, TSLA down (-40%), versus SPY down (-23%). As of March 13, 2020.

SPY has touched December 2018 levels, whereas TSLA is still at its January 2020 levels. 

The takeaway is that there is a long way down for TSLA to go. 

**3. Options are relatively cheap**

Consider a 5/15 Bank of America ATM Put has Implied Volatility of 90% and a 5/15 Tesla ATM Put has Implied Volatility of 100%. The market believes that both stocks have similar volatility. Ask yourself if that makes any sense. 

Be bank, be too thicc to fail, whore yourself out to Daddy P, swallow $1.5 trillion capital ejaculation. Don’t forget retards, banks are the first ones in line to get bailed out by Big Brother (unless you’re the Lehman Brother RIP). 

TSLA on the other hand is a highly cyclical car manufacturer that trades like a tech stock.

Clearly, TSLA should be trading at a higher IV. 

**4. Investor Psychology** 

For the most part of the last year, TSLA was trading sideways between $200 and $300, until that one fateful fall day when it reported blowout Q3 earnings that started its meteoric ascent. 

This next exercise might be hard for most of you since autists don’t experience empathy but try anyways.  

Be a long time TSLA shareholder who owned the stock before the senseless rally. You touched yourself at night thinking about how TSLA was breaking the previous ATH every other day. It hits 900 but you stay greedy and wait for 1,000. All of a sudden while your touching yourself, 🌈 🐻 jumps out the closet and \[this part has been censored due to graphic nature\]. You wake up the next day and you don’t remember what happened, but your bum hole is really sore. TSLA has puked 40% of its value. 

What do you do now:

a) BTFD, like a boomer

b) Do nothing, like a vegetable 

c) Lock in your +100% gains, and roll it into puts, like a true autist

Most TSLA shareholders are still in the money even after accounting for the 40% drop. Once they realize that this beer bat flu is the real deal and start liquidating positions, TSLA will be an easy sell since they are still up +100%. This will lead to more selling and at the end of the day the only people holding TSLA are the idiots who bought in at 800. Fucking cucks.

https://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/press-releases/lvmh-reaches-agreement-with-tiffany-co/

At 16.2 Billion, this is the single largest luxury goods merger in history.  

At the time of the announcement stonks were trading at 
LVMH - $89
TIF - $90

Today

LVMH - $73
TIF - $128

In Feb TIF shareholders approve the merger 

https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/tiffany-stockholders-approve-merger-with-lvmh

This is all well and good but what are the chances LVMH goes through with it? Their CEO is addicted to mergers but he’s also addicted to getting good deals.  

Even if TIF is still worth $135 a share, if LVMH backs out of the merger TIF would plummet to the 70’s or 80’s.  Maybe even 60’s in the wake of the Beer Flu.

LVMH‘s Italian suppliers are balls deep in beer flu and can’t work from home.

What I couldn’t find was anything that shows what LVMH’s breakup fee.  IF Arnault backs out aka there is a chance TIF is sent back to the wild to fend for itself.  If that happens, stonk is gonna drop like a regular non-diamond rock.

Look I’ve lost a good bit on some stupid plays with Moderna but truth be hold however, the company has an impressive yet under developed and under tested pipeline of mRNA technologies. Long term I’d suspect success but thats like forever forever and fast money is really the only money on this sub.

I know what your thinking, “vaccines take at least a year” and that your right ... under normal circumstances.

If Beer Flu 2019 is following the due course of panic and its log plots, it may come to level for which:

1) The FDA has the ability/need to expedite the vaccine timelines, although how much is questionable

2) There will be a patient base for which vaccines can be tested (unlike the lack of SARS patients that invalidated attempt to trial the slowly-developed SARS Vax)


There a lot of companies, many with tried and true reputations that are eyeing a vaccine that:

1) will be bought by a vast majority of the US and international public

2) will be bought, continuously, for the US Gov Stockpile

But even though only one is likely to succeed fully, I’m guessing that getting anywhere close in this race will bump up prices before a swift payday.

No doubt generally market shifts will mess with it but 2-3 months from now, thoughts on:

We just had one of the greatest /most divorced from reality bull runs in *history.* The past 12 years was a giant orgy of capital and shared delusions about how profitability doesn't matter as long as there was growth, and it made 2001 look like a cold baby peen next to its 12 inch schlonger.

The time to stop buying puts is when you literally *cannot imagine a world where stocks go up, where you're not even sure if the US can make it through as a country due to all the problems the virus is causing*, then maybe the bottom has settled in.

I might be autistic, but it looks like $MRRL and $MORL, 2x Leveraged Mortgage REIT ETNs run by UBS, are liquidating, as they are well below the $5 per share threshold for automatic acceleration, have been for more than a day, and their smaller constituents have been getting hammered the past two days with large block market sells at EOD, which implies that whoever is doing the selling is trying to get out quick and doesn't give af how much they get for what they're selling. At this point, almost all of the smaller constituents are trading significantly below their tangible book value (aka what you'd get if you sold off the tangible parts of the company).

This is also reflected in the high volume and final trades of the day on these - very large trades relative to the number of outstanding shares:

- $NYMT - 2.2 million shares sold at market on Monday EOD, 2.4 million shares sold at market today EOD
- $MFA - 1.7 million shares sold at market today EOD
- $CIM - 655k shares sold at market today EOD

Until this selling ends, all of the smaller index components are much cheaper than they should be, since there aren't enough buyers for all the shares that UBS is selling. Buy them or buy calls on them if they're liquid enough once you think the selling is done.

Now, the risk here, (aside from me being retarded and these funds not actually liquidating - it hasn't been announced yet) is that you don't know where the bottom is ie. when UBS will run out of shares to sell. Using $NYMT as an example, we can see that UBS is the fourth largest shareholder with around 9 million shares (or 2.4% of all outstanding shares) as of Dec 2019 here: https://www.nymtrust.com/stock-information/ownership-profile. Assuming those two block sales were them, and some volume during the day was also them, it looks like they should be almost done.

I was reading [market wizards](https://smile.amazon.com/Market-Wizards-Interviews-Top-Traders/dp/B00BYKKJPQ/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=market+wizards&qid=1584480584&sr=8-1) today and the first autist they interviewed talked about how the best bets have all 3 things that point a direction: fundamentals, technicals, and market action. And I'm here to tell you that all 3 are pointing towards TSLA going down.

# Fundamentals

We all know we're headed towards a recession from the bat flu, and WSBGod himself could not design a company to be more vulnerable to the situation. Growth stocks do worse during a recession because growth slows/reverses and people go into value. Luxury goods and expensive big ticket purchases go down because people are trying to save money, which is why China automobile demand was down [81.7%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-auto-sales-plunge-in-february-amid-virus-shutdown/2020/03/12/5d4bbe02-644b-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html) in February. And the specifics of the bat flu has already caused supply chain problems for TSLA: they had to use an [old autopilot processor](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/03/05/coronavirus-forces-tesla-old-autopilot-processors-chinese-model-3/) in their Chinese Model 3 shipments. Everything on a fundamental level points to them getting fucked.

# Technicals

I'm not very good with crayons, but just look at Tesla's performance over the past few months, or as I call it, the sad mountain. Why would anyone ever buy a stock that looked like this?

https://preview.redd.it/f8b92cq50bn41.png?width=2780&format=png&auto=webp&s=d579137db809bdeb8cca2733e07973a233c5ccc7

# Market Action

Finally, there's how the stock reacts to news: if a bull cycle, all bad news get ignored and the stock keeps going up. This is not specific to TSLA, but we're definitely in the bear market: remember how the market tanked 10% the day after the Fed announced QE on Sunday? That's very much a bear market indicator. And today, even though the SPY went up 6%, TSLA was actually **down** 3.5%! Even on the *incredible* news that the SPY was mooning, TSLA still went down. Nothing's going to make this shit moon. As further proof, look at how it's performed compared to some others in the past month.

https://preview.redd.it/w79pzndu0bn41.png?width=2992&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b89b74138370b5311fe97060e414270e4aefd67

# But it's already down 50% and puts are expensive...

This doesn't fucking matter. This is the exact same argument that people made against buying AMZN in 2017, saying it's PE ratio was 100+ and it's went up too much and blah blah blah mew mew mew. Just like in bull markets you have to pay for quality, in bear markets you have to pay for inverse quality.  I think that's the lesson I've really learned from this past month is that stuff can fall faster and harder than ever imagined. Thinking ""it's already down so much..."" is the reason people missed SEAS and SIX and we shouldn't make the same mistake here.

# But I don't wanna bet against Papa Musk

Ah... here comes the real objection. If anyone other than Papa Musk helmed TSLA they would have never even risen about 100 bux, much less now be in a position now to fall from 900 to 420 again. Normally I'd agree with you, but Elon has fallen victim to the affliction that so befalls many great men: hubris. He may have bested the SEC and short sellers, but then he got cocky and went up against the great bat god himself, and now he knows fear. Here was his original tweet on March 6, just 11 days ago:

[Flying too close to the bat stew...](https://preview.redd.it/vnhhn1492bn41.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=77649568a437a9daa441580577b04eb898ad98a1)

And here's his tweet just yesterday:

https://preview.redd.it/9r96idve2bn41.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c6b235ae6e7781be0ac3542ae69e7fd0623e7d

Chloroquine is a drug the Chinese found has some help for bat flu treatment. If the panic is dumb, why is he reading up on treatments/tweeting about it? **He's shook!** He knows he fucked up and now it's gonna cost him. He's panicking by [keeping the Telsa factories](https://www.ttnews.com/articles/musk-keeps-tesla-open-shutdown-zone-downplays-virus-risk) open during all this despite every fucking reason not to, and it's going to cost him. He knows he has to make delivery numbers to keep his stock up, but he's gonna slip up and half his work force is going to get the flu. This flu has shown that even gods like [Heimdall](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/arts/idris-elba-coronavirus.html) are mortal, and Elon Musk is just a man, and all men can bleed.

&#x200B;

Edit: Lots of people are saying don't bet against Musk, and normally I'd agree with you: one of Musk's greatest strengths is his ability to spin stories and inspire his base. But you know who else had that strength and has shown that he can get fucked by the bat flu? The other papa, PAPA TRUMP. Both of them have seemed invulnerable before this, but that's because they were both battling other men before, not a force of nature like the coronavirus. All their usual meme tweets won't do shit in the face of actual biological decline and people getting sick and dying in hospitals. Everyone bleeds.

Edit 2: Just read [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjrjkt/some\_actual\_tesla\_dd\_for\_you\_all\_phone\_call\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fjrjkt/some_actual_tesla_dd_for_you_all_phone_call_with/).

DD,Rite Aid (RAD) Mooning After Earnings 4/09,47,fkcj22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fkcj22/rite_aid_rad_mooning_after_earnings_409/,81,1584505985.0,"All right listen up autists. u/Howard_510 made a damn good DD about a month ago about RAD. Read it.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6k5ot/rad_is_the_next_spce/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Now for the update. Yesterday was Analyst Day, and you guessed it, RAD fucking mooned. Last week, it was down over 40%. Not good right? Well yesterday, it shot up 75%. Yeah, this is better than SPCE, TSLA, GILD, or whatever autistic SPY puts you all are buying. You have the chance to get in before earnings (4/9) with 4/17 calls and make fucking bank. 

For the people who’ve read this far: it’s obvious why RAD dropped so much last week. The markets in the shitter, and we’re in a recession. Soon enough, we aren’t gonna be seeing the crazy volatility and the profitability of calls and puts alike. What does that mean? It means we need to find good, undervalued stocks, and make them the new meme stocks. Fuck the biotech companies who all have the new coronavirus cure, they’re dogshit. RAD is it. In case you didn’t read the original post, they reported earnings in mid December. They beat expectations by 270%, and their stock price shot up from $7.50 to $20 in two weeks. That’s 165%. Free tendies. Can’t go tits up.

[Analyst Day Report](https://www.riteaid.com/corporate/news/-/pressreleases/news-room/2020/rite-aid-to-outline-corporate-strategy-and-growth-plan-at-analyst-day)

Key takeaway:
RAD raised their guidance. Not by a ton, but think about it. A terrible quarter for the economy, and they increase their earnings expectations. Not by a ton, but why would they raise their guidance only to just barely meet it by their earnings call? They know they’re gonna knock it out of the fucking park again and yesterday was just a little taste. 

**Tl;dr - If you like money, load up on any RAD 4/17 calls.**

Positions: I’m a broke boy until RAD moons. Only have 1 contract of RAD 15c 4/17 and 1 RAD 12c 4/17.

Share prices jumped when this was announced March 2nd.

**SINCE THEN**, Nokia has signed partnerships with Intel and Marvell to continue investing in their 5G infrastructure. It's looking like our man Pekka is prioritizing Nokia as an infrastructure company, and going after the big contracts. 

This article points out the promising elements of Nokia's push for more 5g contracts - [https://www.lightreading.com/5g/ericsson-huawei-and-nokias-5g-wins-are-no-big-deal/a/d-id/757677](https://www.lightreading.com/5g/ericsson-huawei-and-nokias-5g-wins-are-no-big-deal/a/d-id/757677)

>A far more useful measure would be a regular quarterly update on market share. Under pressure to scotch concern about its 5G competitiveness, Nokia included one in its last earnings report and promised updates in subsequent financials. In the fourth quarter of 2019, it claimed 27% of the 4G and 5G RAN market outside China, where its reluctance to be as transparent suggests it is struggling. While a number that includes the world's biggest mobile infrastructure market would obviously be even more helpful, neither Ericsson nor Huawei provides anything close. Nokia also indicated that it expects to maintain its 27% share outside China this year.  
>  
>A market share statistic is not the only new metric recently championed by the Finnish vendor. Henceforth, it has promised to show details of what it calls the ""weighted 5G win rate."" The idea is to demonstrate its success at converting 4G customers to 5G and securing entirely new 5G business. A figure of 100% would imply contract numbers are unchanged: Either no customers have defected, or any losses have been offset by new deals. At the end of 2019, Nokia's win rate was more than 100% outside China and in the mid-90% range including China.

The fact that they are being more transparent than their rivals is a positive signal. A 100%+ win rate outside China means they are signing **NET NEW** contracts.

**BUT WAIT -** they also just announced today they upgraded their IoT network to be on 5g - [https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/17/nokia-adds-5g-to-worldwide-iot-network-lets-carriers-test-new-sensors/](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/17/nokia-adds-5g-to-worldwide-iot-network-lets-carriers-test-new-sensors/)

But, we may be betting ahead of the curve.

Prior to the Virus, global GDP was predicted to be 2.9% growth.

[Goldman Sachs](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/economic-recession-forecast-coronavirus-fuel-us-gdp-contraction-market-goldman-2020-3-1028999426) cut its 2020 US GDP growth to 0.4% compared to its 1.2% estimate. [Quarterly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthcare-coronavirus-goldman/goldman-downgrades-u-s-growth-forecast-for-first-quarter-second-quarter-due-to-coronavirus-idUSKBN21217L), they expect the growth forecast for the first (from +0.7% to 0%) and second quarter (from 0% to -5%). Yet, they raised their third (from 1% to 3%) and fourth quarter forecast (from 2.25% to 4%).

[JP Morgan](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/gim/adv/insights/market-insights/weekly-economic-update) actually just comes right out and says it. Recession with two negative quarters in the 2nd and 3rd quarters.

[Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/quarterly-market-outlook) couches their advice in a whole bunch of caveats and no firm numbers. 

WTF, Schwab, put your balls on the table and make a prediction. (Though, I should give them a little bit of leeway since this was the top hit on the Google and I didn’t do any further searching). 

Anyway, the key takeaway from their squishy reporting seems to be your retirement money is safe, because “Historically, stock indexes have tended to return to their previous trajectory within a few months of the peak in global new-case growth.^(1)” 

And see, there’s the rub for me right there. That little footnoted ^(1) above the end of growth. This whole statement is based on the “returns of the MSCI World Index from 01/01/1970 through 2/28/2020, including the following global outbreaks: HIV/AIDS (1981), pneumonic plague (1994), SARS (2003), H5N1 avian flu (2006), dengue fever (2006), H1N1 swine flu (2009), cholera (2010), MERS (2013), Ebola (2014, 2018), measles (2014, 2019) and Zika (2016). Past performance is no guarantee of future results.”

Now, do any of those virus outbreaks resemble what we are facing today? Did any of those viruses actually go viral across the world? I don’t think so.

However, that is the market we’re facing. I still have co-workers thinking this is nothing worse than getting a cold/flu and that this is the bottom and will bounce back in June.

On the other side of that, we have this report from the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/) in which, if you scroll down to the “economic impacts” (just do a Ctrl-F), they state “The direct fiscal impacts of pandemics generally are small, however, relative to the indirect damage to economic activity and growth.” 

To clarify, the cost of developing the drugs, building hospitals, buying additional ventilators, testing individuals are small compared to the indirect damage.

And even further down it gets worse, “World Bank economic simulations indicate that a severe pandemic could reduce world gross domestic product (GDP) by roughly 5 percent.” 

Let that sink in a little. Goldman is predicting a 0.8% decrease in GDP, and we’re looking down the barrel of a -3.8% GDP (according to World Bank simulations).

They conclude the economic impact section with this statement: “A sustained, severe pandemic on the scale of the 1918 influenza pandemic could cause significant and lasting economic damage.”

So, what’s it all mean, I don’t know, except that it looks bad to me. And, if my experience with the Coronavirus is any indication, it’s going to be bad.  When China actually quarantined a large portion of it’s population, the world markets blew it off, and then a month later we finally feel the effects… The fact that all G7 nations have decided to co-ordinate their efforts to buy their way out of the economic downturn that is coming, it is another indication that there is a bad moon rising.

The Q’s have been resistant to even falling at all, since tech people can work from home. Well, how much can you sell, when people are out of work? SPY has been taking a hit because everyone is worried about a disruption for not more than 2Qs and RUT has been leading the way down, because small businesses are shit.

I thought, like you did, that that little bump up around March 3rd was the bull trap. I now think there is a much bigger bump coming that will be the real bull trap. If we’re truly 2 weeks behind Italy, this was the first day they saw a decrease in the growth rate of infected. So, in order to keep ahead of the market, we’ve got a couple days to make the next trade. Everyone is anticipating that 2 weeks from now we’ll see a decrease in the growth rate of the virus. Which means people are going to be buying. **Sell your puts expiring before, IDK Sept**. 

The trade(s):

Trump himself told us we should be good in July/August. With how quickly the market is moving, I am sure the bull buy programs will go into effect quickly. After all, we know when it will end, so why not stock up before then. Tomorrow may be a battle between bulls/bears. The moment the RUT hits 975, the Q’s hit 156, or SPY hits who the fuck knows, which may be tomorrow, I’m switching from a bear to a bull.

On the other hand, I am looking at a catchup trade for year end after this little bull spurt. Qs to hit 2013 levels (about where RUT will be at the Monthly Moving Average).  So, looking for the most profitable strikes for the Q’s to hit mid 60’s, SPY to hit 160.

Current near expiring positions: SQQQ’s 100 $30CMar20 and 30 $25CJun19, some LVS Jun 35P, CPB $36 May 15P. I also sold 10 CCL 12.50 Puts for 4/17, and have a ton of $5 and 5.50 GME calls, that you can see in my post history (and those gonna climb before Friday). 

Call me out on it and I’ll provide a screenshot, but does it really make sense for someone to tell you what he’s already got, when you want proof where he’s going to go. Seems like a great way to get scammed.

Even if I'm completely wrong on above, these stocks are still very high. They should go down either due to (i) complete capitulation/peak fear and need for liquidity or (ii) recovery which will lead to selling FAAGs to jump on much better opportunities from a return perspective.

[\[2A\] International Recoveries](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETaxCF2XgAYTQMb?format=jpg&name=medium)

A key thing to look for and probably the most important moving forward is Italy's data, from there we will have a better idea on what will happen. In the WH conference this morning, they had mentioned a much more precise model coming with 5 days more of data (heavily biased towards Italy and France). US median age is younger which is good for us, but we have higher obesity rate. Since COVID-19 puts enormous stress on cardiovascular system specifically, we will likely end up like Italy or slightly worse even with lower population ageage. 

Italy may be reaching max testing capacity which can create a false flattening curve, so it's too early to judge.

**EDIT AND TLDR** : UUP is a way to measure US dollar futures vs shorts on our trade partners. It goes up when we do better than they do. Bad things are happening in Europe and less bad things happening here. UUP goes up a little and since it has a low IV it’s not super expensive.

**EDIT 2:** TRADING AT 28.60, ITLL HIT 29.20 TODAY BOYS HOOOOOOOLD


Since a lot of people have been YOLO'ing poor investments in the past few days because of the premium price hikes, I decided to find something that wasn't SPY puts with low entry cost for all the noobs and guys out there 50k into a margin call, working their way up.

Here comes UUP.

**What's UUP?**

UUP is the Invesco Deutche Bank US Dollar Bullish Index Fund. Essentially what it does is ""provide inverse exposure to an index of USDX futures contracts that rises in value as the dollar appreciates relative to a basket of world currencies (i.e. US trading partners)"". USDX is the index that measures the value of the US Dollar relative to our trading partners currency- of which, 57.6% is Euro, 13.6% is Yen, 11.9% is the UK Pound, 9.1% is the Canadian Dollar, 4.2% is the Swedish krona, and 3.6% is the Swiss franc.

Basically, UUP goes up when our currency increases in value relative to shorts on trading partners currency.

**Why will UUP go up?**

Since we're trying to measure rate of change between USD and our trading partners, lets discuss the two parties.

First, the USD has a general sense of stability behind it. While the market has been getting absolutely thrashed as of late, Boomers (who control a plurality of total American assets) still have faith in the underlying economy (trust me, Bloomberg told me so yesterday). Everyone and their mother is planning on a 'V shaped recovery.' Even if the Fed prints money until they run out of the color green, give everyone 10k, bail out airlines, cruises, hotels, dog parks, and wherever you go for WSB loss therapy sessions, the dollar devaluation spike will take at LEAST a few weeks to set in.

Now, Europe is in a completely different circumstance. They're not feeling nearly as good on their currency as of late, largely because of how much more significantly they've been effected by massive corporate debt, along with growing fears of COVID affecting individual countries. Germany is the largest single contributor to the Euro stability, and they only just raised their alert level to 'High' yesterday (3/17). on the same day when Italy declared nearly 500 deaths due to Beervirus, their neighbor (the Germans) are taking it fairly lightly. The Robert Koch Institute, a German research institute established by the German federal government, warned that their will be 10M cases of COVID-19 in Germany in the next three months, and it will only get worse if they don't take it more seriously. Additionally, the rest of Europe does not have the same style health system that America has. While yes, the American Health system has its flaws, it is rather good at processing people, which could help prevent massive swells of patients in hospitals that the European health systems don't have.

Now that this new stimulus is going to happen and futures are green, tomorrow and maybe even Friday will see 3% growth in UUP, and I project it will break its 52 week high again just 2 days after hitting 28.01.

So long as the US dollar doesn't absolutely crap itself, pretty much USDX just has to wait for the Euro to sink.

**Why invest in UUP?**

The implied volatility of a $28.00 UUP call is 25%. Depending on which SPY put you invested in you might be looking at an IV of 150% or more, so premiums have adjusted accordingly, and while yeah you're still printing cash investing in SPY puts, you're not going to be printing 500% returns anymore. $29.50 3/27 calls are trading at like 0.25, so their dirt cheap, and you'll be soaking in 43.5% gaines if UUP hits 28.00 literally tomorrow, which it very likely will hit because every day USDX opens about a dollar above the previous day's close, and UUP closed at 27.90 today (opened at 27.03).

**This outbreak is going to destroy Yelp. Their over-reliance on small medium businesses will be their downfall since mom and pops shops are  cutting their advertising budget to cut costs. Also with mandatory lockdowns being rolled out in more and more places the situation will only get worse and worse.**

Yelp primarily generates revenue from from sale of advertising on their site and app from local businesses and to a lesser extent, fees on transactions completed on their platform and subscription fees on their non-advertising products. 

Direct quote from Yelp’s 10-K: **”SMB have also historically experience high failure rate and we must continually add new advertisers to replace those who do not renew their advertising due to factors outside of our control such as the cleaning advertising budgets closures or bankruptcies. As a result SMBs may be the disproportionately affected by negative fluctuations in the business cycle and the worsening economic outlook would likely cause business is to decrease investments in advertising with with adversely affect our revenue”.**

“We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. If we fail to maintain and expand our base of advertisers, our revenue and our business will be harmed.”

**Their customers aren’t locked in. They can cancel at any time. I suspect they have lost a shit ton already and will continue to bleed.**

Risk to Business listed in 10k:

”Our advertisers typically do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products. A substantial and increasing portion also have the ability to cancel their ad campaigns at any time. Their decisions to renew depends on the degree of satisfaction with the products as well as a number of factors that are outside of our control including their ability to continue their operations and spending levels.”

———————————————————

I’m sure, at this point, you’re familiar w/ the term Quantitative Easing and what it means. 

The Fed, as of last night, reopened the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. This facility takes in commercial paper and other interest rate related products and in exchange issues loans (now at a zero rate). Except they added one extra thing... very quietly...


https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20200317b1.pdf

The Fed is prohibited from purchasing securities in the market. 

However, that pdf is the 2020 release laying out the groundwork for the PDCF’s rules and guidelines. 

They added EQUITIES to the list of things they can accept as collateral in exchange for issuing zero interest loans to companies. They backdoored their way into propping up the stock markets by being able to acquire stocks indirectly.


Which means Starbucks, who started share buybacks up again today, can turn around and give the shares they bought back to the Fed, and receive a zero interest loan from the Fed.

This is massive. This was NOT a part of the PDCF’s abilities in 2008. Basically, the PPT has found out how to go mainstream. It will take a bit for this to work it’s way into the system but it is out there.",2020-03-19 04:05:35

If you fit the first 18 days of the Italian outbreak to an exponential, you get the function cases(days)=130\*e\^.239\*days, with an R\^2 of .996. This curve predicts we’d have 82500 cases by today, but we actually have 35713 cases.

If you fit the first 22 days of the Italian outbreak to an exponential, you get the function Cases(days) = 190\*e\^0.21\*days. This curve has an R\^2 of 0.993, and predicts we’d have 55000 cases which is 20000 more than we actually have

If you fit the entire course of the epidemic to a curve, including today's data (which includes the 4200 new cases) you get Cases = 308\*e\^.181\*cases, this predicts we’d have 40000 cases by today. R\^2 is .987. And if you plot the last 4-5 days it looks pretty linear with an R\^2 of 0.998

&#x200B;

So you can see the exponential part is going down and the rate of case growth in Italy is slowing, although they are still living in hell (and I'd encourage those who have gained 10000% in two days to support Italy:  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinesabino/2020/03/17/5-immediate-ways-to-support-italy-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/#15de247e18d5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherinesabino/2020/03/17/5-immediate-ways-to-support-italy-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/#15de247e18d5) ).

- Closing restaurants and bars (drinking away the pain at home just doesn't express my misery enough, I need to be in some piece of shit bar drinking grain alcohol).  Yep.

- Giving everyone equal access to test since it's a ""humanitarian crisis"".  Wait...

Giving the Lakers and Nets special access to testing shows the common denominator in life is STILL money.    Come the end of the month people will prioritize money again, everyone will go back to work, and the economy will make money again.

>*Kayrros, a company that monitors oil storage globally through satellite imagery, said that if current supply and demand projections are accurate, at most there could be six months until all onshore tanks are filled.  “\[But\] in practice, storage capacity is likely to be much more limited than these headline figures indicate due to operational constraints,” said Kayrros, estimating storage was already 61 per cent full. “Not all crude tanks are available to all market participants, and not all crude grades can be stored in any tanks.”*

With crude trading at such a steep discount, traders will begin to buy up physical crude to be stored in offshore tankers with the intention of selling after the market rebounds or when futures begin trading at a premium relative to spot. 

>*Traders often load up ships with crude oil or gas with no immediate intention of moving the cargo around the world, seeking to profit by buying fuel on the cheap and locking in a higher price in the future.*  
>  
>*Refinery shutdowns in China could add the equivalent of 250,000 barrels of crude a day in storage, both onshore and offshore, said London-based consultancy FGE Energy last month. It said commercial storage in Shandong ports—which are connected by pipeline to Wuhan, the virus’s epicenter—are about 65% full, a record level. In that region, the number of barrels stored onshore has risen 18% to 142 million since the beginning of the year, said Geoffrey Craig, an analyst at satellite-data consultancy Ursa Space Systems.*

As long as fuel demand remains low or the price war continues, both onshore and offshore storage facilities will be forced to raise prices in response to the increased global supply of crude. This has already begun.

>*A flood of oil from Saudi Arabia and rival producers is expected to enter the market next month, adding to a surplus of oil that could overwhelm global storage. As markets struggle to find places to stockpile excess crude, “the prospect of single-figure prices…is now pretty inevitable in the coming months,” London-based consultancy FGE Energy said in a recent note.*  
>  
>*Some operators are increasingly turning to midsize oil transport ships, called Suezmaxes, to store oil.* ***But the costs have increased sixfold to $330,000 a day since the beginning of the month****, making such an option increasingly less attractive.*

People wonder why this is and it’s simple bc whoever is selling wants cash and that is because cash is just that. Cash, it’s not going to go up or down, just sit there until it’s time to put it to work again. 

Price actions today, and on a Wednesday seemed wild in the wildest times. I mean I’d look at the ten year and it was up so I’d be like “motherfucking fed you fuckers!!” Then look at my puts and I was up nice. On a side note I bought vxx calls yesterday, 3 for 800 each and sold them at open, around 2 they were worth 1700 EACH!! I managed to come away with 3GS today was 4500 at the lows but I won today and that’s how you look at it. 

Yeah sooo gold was down huge and oil was like ridiculous, so low I never imagined. I thought maybe we get under 20$ bc of everything but not this fast. Not only gold though but other metals, which kinda should be expected bc of the sudden lack of demand then you combine that with speculators and no one wants near the stuff and who can blame them. Gld and slv 4/17 puts?? 

An exodus to cash like nothing seen before means more falling prices and I know a lot of people say it will come back fast and while I am not so sure about that bc I lived through 2008-09 then 2011, all that cash on the sidelines kinda points to some big spikes on the way back up. A bond bubble bursting would be incredible and terrible for equities if the ten year goes to theee or four people won’t want to buy houses all of a sudden bc of much higher interest rates combined with less money covid19  will cause. Equities will loose out when the ten years yield doubles the average dividend of the snp a lot of people will pile into that.

Tiffany has been artificially supported at \~$120 dollars per share because LVMH agreed to buy it out at $135 in mid-2020 ([https://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/press-releases/lvmh-reaches-agreement-with-tiffany-co/](https://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/press-releases/lvmh-reaches-agreement-with-tiffany-co/))

Unfortunately this support is breaking and no one knows whether Louis Vuitton will follow through and keep their promise. Hence TIF is now trying to break through the $110 support line.

Keep your eyes peeled because Tiffany can be in for a bad ride (which is good for puts).

I recommend 6/19 $85p because there's a lot of open interest. HOWEVER, LVMH agreed to buy them out in mid 2020. Thus, you're betting on them not following through.

Thus, a great bet would be anything after mid 2020, but the premiums are extremely expensive.

If you can get puts for 2021 anywhere from $120 to $60 then I think that would be a good bet. Look at how Tiffany has performed in the 08' recession AND the dot com bust. You may start to think that paying for the premiums is a good idea. This is a long term play, but a goodie.  


EDIT: Some people are saying that LVMH may or may not hold up their deal. If they don't, then I think 6/19 $85p are great. Here's the options calculator for it: [http://opcalc.com/4PH](http://opcalc.com/4PH).

The Canadian energy sector has been absolutely rocked in the last 2 weeks due to a >50% drop in oil price. The Canadian oil benchmark, WCS is now trading under $10/bbl, meaning that it now costs unhedged producers more money to take the oil out of the ground than to sell it (lel). Without a doubt, many Canadian high cost of production oil companies will completely evaporate. But fuck them anyways.

Canada's biggest pipeline company is Enbridge, and their share price has dropped from $57CAD to $34.5CAD during this time. Enbridge doesn't build pipelines without first having long term contracts in place to ensure they get their money back. Oil price drop hurts their customers, but they are still going to get paid regardless. Oh but what about the risk of their customers going under? Fortunately, at least in the short term, their largest customers didn't go full autism and hedged a good portion of their crude, so they'll be ok for a while.

Over the last week ENB has been red, green, red, green, and red. Today was a bad day for Canada's oil sector due to a 1 day 20% drop in oil price. ENB was down over 10%. Oil has already bounced off it's lows for the day and I expect some short term gains for ENB. 

Position: 200 ENB.TO shares @ 33.80 CAD

Well... you get Beth Bath & Beyond. I dont think I even know where to start.

The company has been posting terrible results in the last quarters. Showing 8% decline in Net sales consecutively. Which is crazy.

[Latest 10-Q Form](https://preview.redd.it/0spash9t8hn41.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=941a7e42b4bb3a8e7937dee5ccb81feee7526917)

This is specially bad considering they were already in a steep decline

As of 2019 third quarter, the company has posted losses for about $38M (bout 30 cents a share) Which is also pretty bad for a $1.7B company

Also, for the past year they started doing deep share buybacks. So cash situation is also bad.

https://preview.redd.it/tqfkq325ahn41.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=40f1cf4452cbd4dcd15c898dfe8bd71b1d30bd04

The company decided to remove the 2019 Financial guidelines (which is basically saying they're not going to meet them), and deployed a ""new strategy"" for 2020. They did this in early January before they could possible be aware of the beervirus so I'm assuming here that the plan is about to change.

Finally, debt. Oh yes. There is debt. At the end of 2019, the company announced lay-offs and some store/sections closings. As for November 2019, the D/E ratio was 2. Yes, TWO. Meaning 2 thirds of the company is due as obligation in the next 6 years (moreso in 2020/2021 with leasing and shit)

When it comes down to it, do you see them evolving in the next two quarters into profitability? If they don't do it by then, they'll need to merge.

Puts are quite cheap still, so don't go too OTM because not sure how much room left this company has to fall. Could they go to 0? Maybe I'm crazy but I don't see people changing house appliances (at least the ones that do are not doing it in BBBY)

For a quick overview of the company: Bed Bath & Beyond is a retail company selling cleaning products, household goods, and toiletries (don't get erect over a similar sounding word to toilet paper quite yet, retards).

In recent years, its stock has taken a plunge. They've missed nearly every earnings report in recent quarters, leading to a swap in CEOs. In December, in the midst of the holiday season, **6 key executives left Bed Bath & Beyond**. The retailer warned that December and January store sales had slipped **5.4%**. Remember, this was before the coronavirus. The new CEO has been gunning for a recovery, but a 5% decline in sales during the holiday season, sprinkled with the coronavirus, is a recipe for bankruptcy.

Unlike the airline, restaurant, and hotel industries which have been squeezed dry of shorting profits in recent weeks and yet will likely get bailed out by the gov, there's no chance for a bailout for fucking BB&B. The next earnings report is scheduled for **4/15,** and I have no doubt this will be the worst earnings report in the companies history. With the company's downward trajectory accelerated by the coronavirus, I am of the view that bankruptcy is highly likely. Their financials are trash, top-line, bottom-line, all lines are shit, and if the beer virus isn't eliminated within the next several quarters, I don't see any way in which this company will survive.

FYI: Stores closed due to coronavirus. Online store still open. Let me know if you know anyone who uses the Bed Bath & Beyond online store instead of Amazon.

TL;DR: Bed Bath and Beyond is beyond fucked. Possible bankruptcy and no bailout. Disastrous earnings report incoming.

Now on top of that fact that they will lose out on all sales from tickets, who is going to want to watch this without a live crowd?  Part of what makes this popular is the atmosphere and it will be the lamest atmosphere ever.  If you look at other companies with live events they have been hit harder than WWE even though they have been in an upwards trend.   WWE should not be above $30, and when people see the poor ratings from Wrestlemania the stock is bound to tank.

On Tuesday we observed \~2.4M viewers, which is similar to Fri/Sat/Sun statistics. Prior weekdays we're observing 2.0M viewers. A recent \~20% increase, cool. What's crazier, in the past 6 months, we're observing an average 1.2M viewers on a Tuesday. A \~100% increase, *very cool*.

We can see COD Warzone doing exceptionally well. A big question is whether or not it will sustain the hype. Because it is crossplatform out-of-the-box, I think we will see high levels of success given the 'social distancing' and school closures.---

This is the chance before domestic travel gets canceled to get in on it before the final tank and then bailout.

Even as of this morning, flights are finally cheaper to book on them.

Look, I love Southwest Airlines. However, their hubs are just going to continue to get obliterated. I don't think government intervention saves them. Not this time. I had a coworker(boomer) tell me that they had bought $LUV in the 30's many times and sell in the 50's many times, I just don't think this is the case.

As panic continues to build, my hypothesis is that the next wave of selling will primarily be in companies which have had large, smooth gains over the last 5 years, but whose levels haven't yet cratered to 2016 levels.

I am betting on the psychology of the holders who will accelerate the panic selling. EG: Lets say I'm a boomer near or in retirement. I've been holding my $SHOP stock for 5 years and steadily watched that thing run up to a 500% unrealized gain. Then in the last month just watched that gain go to 250%. Now I'm thinking OH FUCK WHAT IF IT GOES TO 0. Better pull my tendies out now while I'm still ahead of the game so I can still retire in 2 years.

And before you go whining about how ""AMD is strong lulz retard"" - my thesis is based purely on fear-selling - almost nothing to do with what the fundamentals of the business are. I'm playing with the assumption that ALL stocks are going to get repriced down to their 2012-2016 levels.

Some candidates where I think we've got ""room to go"" for the panic selling are:

Square pulls 20%~ or so from each night transactions and puts it towards your “debt” his loan has to pay atleast 6k every 60 days to remain active on square else they shut down your terminal.

He like most have DEEP fucking loans via square. Square is the most popular POS system for businesses under 1million dollars revenue.

But all the casinos and other large properties have to close.  Not sure how they plan to do that.  These hotels have a couple of hundred-thousand people in them at any time.

Now that patients are refusing to sit in the waiting rooms to hand us money, and we’re running out of masks and gloves, we have finally decided to implement telemedicine as of this week. What’s more, Trump decided today that we can get paid for it even though we aren’t in a rural area. Medicare announced this via email this evening. This was the previous excuse management had been using, and now it’s gone. See below.

[You can check out the Twitter replies here ](https://twitter.com/blueapron/with_replies)

Grocery stores are already almost empty and limited on food essentials. These grocery stores are numero uno when It comes to priority delivery in the supply chain. Blue Apron is not going to be able to get food when competing against large grocery chains trying to stock the same food. As this virus spreads and these businesses start to become affected from sick personnel or limited resources, the strain on those supply chains is going to increase and when they do the grocery stores will be the main priority. I consider this $APRN’s last breath. Goodnight sweet chef.

Edit 1: Sorry forgot to provide positions. 2p 4/17 - 

The other reason I am pretty bullish on this position is because I was discussing with a family member who works for a larger butcher distribution in the tri-state area who services massive grocery stores and he said they were having trouble keeping up with supply and that if a smaller number of employees get sick at their butcher houses, they have to completely close and be disinfected and then inspected.

>**Basics of Max Pain**  
>  
>Max pain theory says that the option writers will hedge the contracts they have written. In the case of the market maker, the hedging is done to remain neutral in the stock. Consider the market maker's position if he must write an option contract without wanting a position in the stock.  
>  
>As the option expiration approaches, option writers will try to buy or sell shares of stock to drive the price toward a closing price that is profitable for them, or at least to hedge their payouts to option holders. **Call writers sell shares to drive share price down and Put writers buy shares to drive share price up. The max pain strike price exists somewhere in the middle.**

&#x200B;

MM will both be trying to push calls and puts to max pain, which for the SPY, is at $300. Call writers will sell shares in order to try to push price down. Put writers will buy shares in order to push the price up. Considering the recent drill over the past month:

Call Writers Exposure: $81M

Put Writers Exposure: **$14B**

I think its fairly obvious MM's with put liability will overpower those with call liability.

More DD?

In an absolutely devastating liquidity crunch, what a coincidence it is that the FED are reinstating the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) from '08, except now repayment terms on loans are no longer overnight, they are 90 days, and the FED has reduced restrictions on acceptable collateral to now include investment grade corporate debt securities, international agency securities, commercial paper, municipal securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities; **plus equity securities.** This facility began ops at 9PM tonight and will run for at least the next 6 months.

Yes, California is on lock down and the virus is mutating, but none of that actually matters. This is simply market manipulation. Expect your regularly scheduled bear market next week.

**TLDR:** SPY mooning tomorrow. I'm not saying it will open green, but these put writers will do anything in their power to reduce their exposure here before close, hence the name, witching hour.

Obviously all beauty retailers have taken a massive hit due to the income elasticity of their products, but that’s not where it ends. The underlying demand for skincare products is going to plummet due to two reasons during this multi-month quarantine period.


1, Women aren’t going outside anymore, so there’s no need for them to put on makeup. How much uglier are your wives right now than they usually are? Are they starting to look like Frida Kahlo? I thought so. 


2. Acne is going to decrease, a LOT. This is not even close to scientific but people are now washing their hands & showering much more than they ever have. In addition to this, they’re not going outside so they aren’t being exposed to pollution, and even if they are pollution is decreasing from less traffic & factory activity.

Much of this has not been felt by skincare companies yet because people usually have a month’s supply of skincare/acne product at home. However, this will crush their revenue over time & the next earnings reports for companies like ULTA, KAOOY & KSRYY will be abysmal.

DD,Cruise stock DD - TL;DR Cruises massively oversold and can weather pandemics for a year,35,flgdae,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flgdae/cruise_stock_dd_tldr_cruises_massively_oversold/,22,1584675906.0,"I was reading a fascinating blog post bringing a rare glimpse into the insights of the cruise charter business:  
   
https://www.myvacaya.com/the-charter-cruise-resort-business-a-primer/

Vacaya is a new all-gay full-ship cruise and land resort charter business. Their only competitors is [Atlantis Events.](https://atlantisevents.com/) 

Apparently cruise-ship charter terms are very hard-line and non negotiable. Pandemic is actually one of the clauses in the contract that is specifically called out - no refunds for a pandemic to the charter companies:

> The Charter Contract
>Charters are not part of a cruise line’s standard week-to-week business of selling cruises to the general public. It’s a carve out, run by its own department with its own executives, budgets, sales force, sales goals, operations team, etc. And this one aspect of our relationship with the cruise lines is the one that’s causing most of the confusion as it relates to all that’s going on with Covid-19. Because cruise lines have carved out charters as a separate business, we don’t get the same benefits the general public would get in regard to the rebooking terms and conditions the cruise lines are offering to their standard (read non-charter) passengers. We are being held to a different set of terms. And frankly, they’re not very forgiving.

>In fact, “pandemic” is a specific call out where most of the cruise lines ultimately bear no responsibility whatsoever – creating a sort of “like it or lump it” scenario. So we’re having to have very complicated conversations – ones where relationships are worth their weight in gold – with multi-billion dollar corporations whose charter business is a locked revenue stream for them, not subject to the ups and downs of standard sales (since the contracts are guaranteed so far in advance). These cruise line’s guaranteed charter revenue is sometimes used to balance losses the company might face elsewhere (for instance, during these Covid-19 days where they’re having to give so much back to their non-charter guests). So the cruise lines hold to those contractual guarantees with a tight grip, holding nearly all the cards over the charter companies.

>It’s a really tricky position for us to be in – caught in a strange in-between. These large corporations can afford to have a bad year. Sure, their shareholders might not like it, but they’re built to withstand even major business disruptions. But make no mistake about it, the cruise lines will lose countless millions here. But… and it’s a big but… they are all likely to weather this particular storm. Charter companies like VACAYA are in a much different spot – unable to amortize losses across fleets of ships sailing week in and week out like the cruise lines can. We are an event company – with set events throughout the year. So we have to approach these challenge in a different way. And our challenges are myriad.

In general, chartering has become massively popular. There's all kinds of cruise ship charters - nude cruises, star trek, huge EDM parties, etc. Cruise ships have tons of guaranteed revenue from the charters. Unlike other businesses they had the foresight to prepare for pandemics.


# TL;DR what call-strike-etc
Cruise lines are over sold. Buy cruises - they can weather this pandemic and were smart enough to put it in their contracts of their guaranteed revenue.

His prediction is modeled off the 1987 crash: we are going to see a multi week rally off these lows -> after 2-3 weeks we’ll start heading down as the economic data starts coming out -> will eventually test these current lows 2-3 months after that -> then finally bounce to start another upward trend (signaling to get offensive). 

Based on his prediction, we should climb about 14% over 2-3 weeks (SPY to ~270) then will fall to <= ~238 2-3 months after that before climbing again.

Bought SPY $267 calls this morning that expire 4/8. Plan is to flip those to poots for the retest of the lows around 6/6/20.

Now, let's just summarize what's going on real quick: we have a  virus causing a pandemic, it results in high rates of hospitalization and of those hospitalized, a high rate of ICU admissions. It's causing people to quarantine and has thus resulted in a significant drop in hotel, casino, airline, and restaurant stocks with expected increases in unemployment. 

UNH's main insurance biz makes money by taking money from people and hoping not to pay for them to go to hospitals. With an expected increase in rates of doctor visits, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions, UNH is going to be paying through the nose for their customers. Add in spike in unemployment, we're talking decreased revenues in the future.  

So spike in costs + decreased revenues = heavy drop in earnings

In June, Eldorado and Ceasars announced a merger/buyout of CZR for $8.40 plus .0899 shares of ERI. The deal is scheduled to close in the first half of 2020 and the contract doesn't have an out for Force Majeure or anything similar. CZR is currently trading at $4.5, well below the value of the deal. As of 2pm EST 3/19 there is a 200% return to buy shares and hold until the deal closes. The initial end date to close the deal is June 25, but [a NY Times article](https://nypost.com/2020/03/11/eldorados-acquisition-of-caesars-may-be-in-trouble-due-to-coronavirus/) points to efforts to close the deal ASAP.  [This Seeking Alpha article is also an interesting read.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4331531-eldorado-resorts-now-interesting)

CZR is trading way below the merger value due to the risk of the deal falling through. There have been a few articles that have stated the financial penalties for abandoning this deal, but the merger contract is the best place to research this ( [http://www.snl.com/Cache/IRCache/ce066ae36-d2d9-28c3-e48b-b30ab32744fa.html#d767286dex21.htm](http://www.snl.com/Cache/IRCache/ce066ae36-d2d9-28c3-e48b-b30ab32744fa.html#d767286dex21.htm))

""If the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances relating to changes in the recommendation of the board of directors of Eldorado in favor of the issuance of shares of Eldorado Common Stock in the Merger or in certain circumstances following the failure of Eldorado’s stockholders to approve such issuance, then Eldorado will be required to pay Caesars a termination fee of approximately $154.9 million. In addition, each party will be obligated to reimburse the other party’s expenses for an amount not to exceed $50 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated because of the failure to obtain the required approval of such party’s stockholders (creditable against any termination fee that may subsequently be paid by such party)........

The Merger Agreement also provides that Eldorado will be obligated to pay a termination fee of approximately $836.8 million to Caesars if the Merger Agreement is terminated (i) due to a law or order relating to gaming or antitrust laws that prohibits or permanently enjoins the consummation of the transactions, (ii) because the required regulatory approvals were not obtained prior to the End Date or (iii) due to Parent willfully and materially breaching certain obligations with respect to the actions required to be taken by Parent to obtain required antitrust approvals. ""

Whether Eldorado bails or not, it's clear that Eldorado is going to finish the regulatory process on this either way. There is also a 1/3 cent per day penalty for every day past March 25th that the regulatory process isn't completed, so I expect this deal to close or cancel fairly quickly.

One big question that I can't answer is why isn't Eldorado buying as many shares as it can, driving the price up to $8.4, which is what they are paying anyways? One answer might be that they are not legally allowed to do that, another might be that they will, but right before the deal happens (so that they don't trigger other investors that the deal is 100% happening. I have spent some time reading the merger contract (linked above) but it's a lot of text. Maybe one of you knows or can find out in the contract whether or not ERI can buy shares on the open market?

There are  682,161,838 shares of CZR and a market cap of \~3 billion. Much of that is owned by institutions, but with price falling every day it is clear that people and institutions alike are selling. ERI agreed to pay $8.40 cash per share, a 5.7B value before the .0899 shares.

Another nice thing is that the risk should be limited, unless CZR goes to 0. These are unprecedented times, so while that is possible, it is certainly unlikely.  I don't really think that anyone in the deal or currently lending to them wants them to go to 0, but in this market I could see it happening so fast that nobody can stop it. One example of a partner that probably wants this deal to go through is VICI, the company that is going to own some of the strip properties and lease them back to Eldorado. The reason that i believe that they are still happy with the deal is that they have put/call rights in the contract. If I understand the call/put contract properly, VICI can force Eldorado to purchase the properties in 2022-2024 if it is better for them. JP Morgan should also be okay with the debt that they have committed to because they have to put their money to work somewhere, and the gaming industry is historically a highly profitable industry.

TL;DR - Eldorado Resorts (ERI) is purchasing Caesars Entertainment (CZR) for $8.40 cash plus .0899 shares of Eldorado per share. Caesars is trading at $4.5. Purchasing shares and holding until the deal closes gives \~200% return ($4.50 for \~$9.10). This is a good price for the risk of the deal not closing. There are too many companies with too much exposure to let this deal fall through. Buy CZR and hold until the deal closes for a great short term return.",2020-03-19 21:56:26

Some quick fundamentals:

* Their P/E is now down to around 15.
* **It pays a VERY healthy dividend** (almost 4% annualized) which is exceptionally high within the tech sector. Dividend-paying profitable companies are safe havens for investors during recessionary periods.
* Lots of its product offerings are ones that enable clients to work securely and remotely.
* Their main teleconferencing product, WebEx, is seeing record usage right now - their CEO went on CNBC and said that already through March, [WebEx has had 5.5 billion meeting minutes recorded](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/cisco-ceo-says-5point5-billion-minutes-of-webex-meetings-due-to-coronavirus.html).
* Their debt-to-equity ratio is .45. For comparison, perennial competitor MSFT (of whom I already am enormously bullish), is at roughly 0.7. With interest rates at literally 0, all companies with lower current debt obligations are in great shape to take on more debt to get them through a downturn.

Many speculated that it related to increased test kits or initiating vaccine trials both of which are old news. And he did talk about them, but he never really gave the big FDA update that was initially touted. Even after speaking about the increased testing, the vaccine trials, and the hospital boat, Trump still alluded to something big with the FDA that will be released today. So what else could there be? According to the WSJ, it may have been that Trump wanted the FDA to approve demonstrated-safe treatments for COVID-19. 

https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/trump-sought-to-expand-virus-drug-tests-over-fda-objections-11584545251

Of course, the article says that the FDA pushed back on this, and maybe that’s why we didn’t get the FDA update yesterday. But we were still told that there would be a significant FDA development. Perhaps Trump just needed the extra time to clarify how his executive order defines the word “safe”. After all, he doesn’t actually need the FDA’s approval to issue an executive order. But he does care about patient safety, so he may have wanted to clarify on this point which the WSJ notes was contentious for the FDA.

Furthermore, when asked about the FDA and potential treatments yesterday, Trump specifically said, “We are making a lot of progress therapeutically, and that’s all I’ll say.” And then there’s the following WH correspondent Tweet from yesterday related to his briefing today:

https://mobile.twitter.com/weijia/status/1240456119270678530

There have been anecdotal reports of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine being effective in China and now in France. And the evidence from *in* *vitro* testing seems to support the anecdotes:

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0156-0

https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/old-malaria-drug-hydroxychloroquine-may-help-cure-coronavirus-study/

Chloroquine is too toxic, potentially, but hydroxychloroquine is not. The evidence even shows that it might be effective as a prophylactic. If much of our concern centers on lack of healthcare workers due to them catching the virus, maybe, just maybe, this solves that problem entirely. The lack of PPE supplies is still an issue, but the Defense Production Act will address that. Hydroxychloroquine is not in short supply due to its regular use for other conditions.

I’ve got evidence that TEVA supplies much of the HCQ in the US. And despite its relatively inexpensive production, a single course is over $100 even without a discount (that’s without insurance). They’re making big money on a generic. The reality is that any generic manufacturer (Mylan, Novartis, etc...) could be a good long call here and even non-generic manufactures that have their own treatments incoming (Pfizer, Regeneron, Gilead) (though safety might be an issue). TEVA announces their Q1 earnings at the end of April, and right now their options are dirt cheap. Furthermore, they are currently extremely undervalued.

All of this feeds investor sentiment, and I believe it gives us enough hope and vision to drive up markets overall. It is possible that this leads to a turning point. We still have the fallout of social isolation to cope with, so we’ll still have red days and bears are safe, but this might give us a solid vision for recovery. China announced zero deaths yesterday. South Korea’s mortality rate is very low. China said that the US should follow Korea’s example. We’re already socially isolating. Perhaps therapeutics (along with Defense Production) is the next step.

1. Citrus and $OJ has had unconscious association with immunity forever--vitamin C not only pro immunity compound (bioflavanoids, etc.)
2. Frozen juice in can such sliding consumption over decades but in absence of fresh squeezed, any marginal demand would be huge. When last time you bought?
3. **60% of crop grown in Brazil.** In the hinterlands. Requiring farm labor to harvest. Then rail to transport to the sea. Then 4000 mile trip to florida etc. terminals. LOLZ if you think Brazil of all places won't get fucked by the Chinese Virus and that they have a resilient supply chain.
4. **Price settles in Florida warehouses**. Meaning that's the only place (realistically) where supply demand matters if you need it NOW to produce.
5. Most of bottlers are still in Florida. So very short supply chain from FL groves and stocks, most processing automated, food processing critical infrastructure.
6. Futures on a relative basis lowish volume. Not much needed in terms of marginal consumer demand to spike price.
7. Concentrate (raw materials) quite low % of final consumer price at store -- 2x or 3x in concentrate price doesn't imply 2x price at the store, maybe 1.1-1.5x MAX
8. Implied vol of options in the 20%s recently low 30%s LOLOL despite being a storable, high calorie food commodity in a time of scarcity.

The most recent research is narrowing in on the fact that treatment must take place in two phases. First is to give antivirals to patients in the early stages of the disease. Then once the patient develops ARDS, to give anti-inflammatories. The drugs used in each stage that have shown promise can be found below. 

**Antivirals**

Remdesivir: main issue is cost (~$1K per day - Gilead)

Favipiravir: Japan based drug. Has a huge supply, prob. enough to export 

Lopinavir/Ritonavir: Used already vs HIV/AIDS (AbbVie)

**Anti-Inflammatories**

Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine: Cytokine inhibitor (Sanofi/Bayer)

Actemra (tocilizumab): IL_6 inhibitor (Roche)

Kevzara (sarilumab): IL_6 inhibitor (Regeneron and Sanofi)

Trump knows this but faces two hurdles. 

1. Cost of drug produced. 

2. Treatment approval from the FDA.

Trump cleared the first hurdle by enacting the Defense Production Act of 1950 which allows him to give orders to the private sector to start production and control drug prices to prevent profiteering. (Ex. Gilead)

In regards to the second hurdle, Trump hinted earlier today in the press conference that he had some exciting news to share about the FDA tomorrow. Some leaked rumors are saying that he has secured conditional approval by the FDA to allow the use of the drugs above. If so, Trump has paved the way for the immediate scaling and treatment of Covid-19 in the US. This is huge and will have a large psychological impact on sentiment along with the recent stimulus passed.

SPY calls at bottom tomorrow before the presser. Market is going to jump on the news during it.

Monday ➡️ Tuesday (90% increase)
Tuesday ➡️ Wednesday (57% increase)
Wednesday ➡️ Thursday (57% increase)
Thursday ➡️ Friday (28% increase)

I decided to apply the compounded growth rate of a modest 20% daily increase to the current transmission rate of 6000 daily

The formula is:
y = a(1 + r)^x

a = initial/current value
r = rate
x = periods
y = future value after x periods 

So plugging that in for:
a = 6000 (current daily transmissions)
r = .20 (modest 20%)
x = 10/30/60 days

y = 37,150/1,424,257/338,085,086 new cases everyday

TL;DR 
The government will have to implement extreme methods to stop the increasing transmission rate 
OR
There will be at least 140,000 daily deaths by 30 days from now and 3.38million by 60 days at 1% death rate

Who in the right fucking mind is doing any kind of online dating right now? How the hell are you supposed to Disney+ and ""put it in his and/or her pooper"" while maintaining social distancing? And with the begining of massive lay offs, what's one of the first things people are going to cut? Superfluous subscriptions like Tinder Gold, which they were a fucktard for having in the first place. 

Ok, past the obvious, these guys are about to have some serious debt. From their Q4 earnings, they listed 417M in current liabilities with 676M in current assests, which isn't bad. But they're also looking at 1.6B in long-term debt, which stands to double when they complete their spin off from IAC Holdings in 2Q20. That would make their debt surpass their total assests of 2.4B. They missed on their Q4 revenue estimate, which they cited increased competition as the reason, so more than likely Q1 and 2 won't be so great either with COVID19 considerations as well. 

Will online dating go away? Hell no. But in the short term I'm sure they'll continue taking hits. Now they, like many others, have been taking a beating lately and they're down nearly 40% this month and are sitting at their 52w low. Regardless, their current P/E is still at 27.5 so I'm willing to bet they still have room to fall.

Until we shut down the entire country as a whole (like China), interstate commerce will continue to spread it. All that shutting down those states does is to ensure that they will become hotspots once they open back up. Without a vaccine, mass shutdown, or a cheap treatment the bear thesis will continue.  


&#x200B;

Hydroxychloroquine is being bandied about as a possible treatment to Kung Flu and while its safety and efficacy aren't proven that won't stop people from trying it. Especially after The Presidents display today ( [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-chloroquine-trump.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/health/coronavirus-chloroquine-trump.html) ).

Saw the news that Miami-Dade county is [shuttering all hotels in Miami Beach](https://wsvn.com/news/local/miami-beach-to-close-all-hotels-amid-coronavirus-concerns/).

One of the major hotels on that strip is the Fontainebleau Miami. So I did a little digging and they're a private company and they took out a huge refinancing loan but it's impossible to find out who owns it. So I did what usually I do best and gave up. 

But I did remember that the 1 Hotel Miami is another major hotel on that strip, and was [sold last year](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article226512405.html) to Host Hotels. Especially since they were awaiting a fat wad of cash from dumbass spring breakers, thats a pretty big blow.

I did a little more digging. They're described as one of the top owners of 'luxury and upscale' hotels. In this climate, who the fuck wants to stay in one of those? 
[2/3 of their revenue comes from room rentals and another 30% from food and drink sales.](https://imgur.com/CmzI7GM)
The U.S accounts for more than 95% of their revenue and NY and FL are their biggest markets. [Occupancy is below the median on a good day](https://imgur.com/1MyUutW).

[The fucks also planned to budgeted $1B on share buybacks last year](https://ir.hosthotels.com/news-releases/news-release-details/host-hotels-resorts-inc-reports-results-second-quarter-2019) ([higher than 90% of the industry](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/total_buyback_3y/NYSE:HST/3-Year-Share-Buyback-Rate/Host-Hotels--Resorts)) so they shouldn't count on a bailout anytime soon.

In spring 2019 ULTA reached a 52-week high of $368.83.. going into this February 21 and the first day of the beginning of the downtrend ULTA was sitting at $300 per share. After today's close it is now at $148. Is there more to squeeze to the downside on this one? I'm not sure, but my opinion is yes. 

Let's compare ULTA now to the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Keep in mind, ULTA has very strong brand loyalty and also has rights to the Kylie Jenner line, which they didn't have back in 2008. From peak to trough during the financial crisis ULTA went from $15 to $4.50, a 70% drop.

*ULTA during 2008/2009 crisis.*

&#x200B;

From peak to trough during the current corona virus crisis, ULTA has gone from $300 to $148 what it closed at today. Let's say a 50% drop, already pretty hefty! 

https://preview.redd.it/eje4umn0qwn41.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=355620a72002a61b7d190fa6ce02b6e4b455dca8

*ULTA during Corona Virus Feb/Mar chart.*

&#x200B;

What makes me think there might be more to squeeze? Well I went through there financial reports and it looks like during all of fiscal year 2019 they spent almost ALL of their profits re-purchasing stock (at all time highs). Take a look at this, from there earnings release. 

https://preview.redd.it/u3sxitq1qwn41.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca8eb9fc15938405a3c3ffbf22b269a445b7f4b

*ULTA outlook 2020 from financial report.*

Not only that, but the board had approved a new share authorization program of up to 1.6 billion. This is including the share re-purchase program already in place of $875 million re-purchase program initiated in 2019. ULTA's new re-purchase program will be a total of $725 million for fiscal year 2020. To put this into perspective, in 2019 ULTA did $7.21 billion in sales at an approximate profit margin of 10% for a total profit of $594 million. 

https://preview.redd.it/sz0kdr39qwn41.png?width=1746&format=png&auto=webp&s=36b01eb769fc1259a45fb1c916ceffa49de79480

*ULTA's announcement of adjusted re-purchase program for 2020.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, something interesting happened to ULTA stock today March 20th. The stock opened up about +8% and remained there for most of the day. Until the final 10 minutes of trading hours it was sitting at +10% for the day. At 3:54pm there was a huge sell-off. Look at the volume of the sell-off compared to the volume for the entire day. Long red candles that were held up with some big buying power just to keep it afloat. What are my thoughts on this? It is my opinion that a big fish sold off a significant position of the stock, which was then propped up by market makers to keep the stock afloat. It ended up closing up only 0.71% for the day. Please note this is only speculation and my opinion.

*ULTA's daily chart from today Mar 20, 2020.*

**Disclaimer:** I have a short position on the stock. 

### Summary

**1.** ULTA has fairly strong balance sheet (with not much debt) sitting at $208 million cash or roughly 2.47% of the value of their market cap.  
**2.** ULTA has strong brand loyalty, including Kylie Jenner's line of cosmetics.  
**3.** However, if recession is looming cosmetics generally don't fare well during these times.  
**4.** In 2019 they spent nearly all their free cash flow after running operations and expansions on the re-purchase of stock.  
**5.** In 2019 they did $660 million worth of share re-purchases and logged $594 million revenue for the year.  
**6.** In 2020 they announced they've increased the buy-back program from $875 million to $1.6 billion, an increase of $725 million.  
**7.** In their March 2020 conference call they also stated that there current numbers have NOT taken any of the CoronaVirus factors into effect.  
**8.** In 2008 their stock crashed nearly 70% from peak to trough.  
**9.** Currently in 2020 during corona virus outbreak, they have had a 50% decline in stock price.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR; they literally spent most of their money on share buy-backs last year when the stock was at ATH and this thing still has room to drop.

DD,The debt cycle,39,fm4gax,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm4gax/the_debt_cycle/,17,1584773333.0,"A while back I noticed this interesting chart from something called boom bust 360. It indicates an adjusted value of the S&P at 1500 by the end of the year due to the corporate debt bubble.   

 [http://aqonomics.com/](http://aqonomics.com/)

If you aren't familiar with how debt causes recessions I would recommend a video from Ray Dalio called how the economic machine works: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0). The premise of the video is that if someones value was only effected by their productivity, then value would increase linearly with productivity. When a person is given a loan, they have more initial value, but will have to pay it back and hence reduce there future spending (unless they are able to earn more money.) The same is true for a company which takes out a loan, they will have to cut spending in the future to pay off the loan (unless they are able to increase their productivity to earn more.)    

The past few years, companies earning growth have slowed down, but the value of companies kept rising  [https://imgur.com/gallery/UcT0bo6](https://imgur.com/gallery/UcT0bo6) . Companies were less likely to repay their debt burdens through productivity and kept accruing more debt. In order for companies to pay off their debt, they lay off employees. Next week, we will notice a huge surge in unemployment, due in part by the coronavirus shutdowns and corporate debt.  

To counteract the unemployment, the government is offering stimulus packages including: 

1. Lowering interest rates to the central bank down to 0%.
2. QE
3. Direct Payment to citizens.

QE and low interest rates lead to inflation and an increase in asset prices if the money is used to reinvest in assets. The reason there is so much corporate debt to begin with is because of low interest rates after the 2008 crash.   

The big question is whether companies will take out more loans at a lower rate, in order to maintain current employees, hire more employees, and invest in assets. Seeing that companies already are seeing limited growth prior to the crash, they are likely to be more cautious which may create a spending cut cycle. Asset prices will be graded based on supply and demand. With a reduction in spending, demand will be lower, creating an increase in supply which will lower asset prices. Recessions don't last a month, this will take a long time due to the spending cut cycle. As long as the corona virus threat persists to slowdown economic activity, there will be a reduction in spending.",2020-03-21 02:48:53

""Economists at Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BofA) have projected that initial jobless claims could top 2 million next week, up from 281,000 in the most recent report; with GS saying the number could be as high as 2.25 million and BofA forecasting that they may reach 3 million.  

At the peak of the Great Recession, jobless claims hit 665,000, and the highest number of claims previously recorded was on October 2, 1982 at 695,000.  

The projections from GS and BofA almost seem like a joke when you look at the chart over last 50 years...only they're not a joke and are reflective of the near-total shutdown of American business.

So remember that DOL report I told you about earlier? Yeah well like I said they do it weekly. [They released one this past thursday](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf), HOWEVER, they only reported the data up to MARCH 14! What does that mean? The throngs of people that started getting laid off this week have not been reported officially to the public yet, and when they do next thursday, I speculate the market will bleed in reaction to all of their consumers being without work and without money. **There's one caveat to this speculation:** I'm not sure how fast people can file for unemployment. So if someone was laid off this thursday and they don't report it till next Tuesday, my speculation could be a week early.

Personally, I'm going to be looking for non-essential retail companies over the weekend to collect a series of tickers to buy end of april / may puts for.

The jobless claims peaked literally < 1 week after the Sp 500 bottomed out in March 2009 - and the correlation looks fairly strongly negative (Likely R\^2 correlation > 30-40%).

Do we think that a similar type of correlation could exist now? If so, how strong? How useful do we think jobless claims are in predicting market bottom?

We all know the current gay market is from corona-chan freezing the economy and pushing for financial meltdown against the overly leveraged autists we call ""institutional investors."" This isn't any new circumstance that's being taken advantage of, or any new legislation that enabled financial  instruments like ABSs (asset back securities) or CDOs/CLOs  (collateralized debt/loan obligations) to be scrutinized and passed off as ""acceptably trustworthy collateral"". In fact, the MBS (mortgage  backed security) or the CMO (collateralized mortgage obligation) are  just two types of a financial instrument class. Now, corporate bonds of  any and all grades become components to building up these securitized  debt instruments. We've seen VCSH, VCIT, HYG, and JNK tanking as the  price for taking out protection against CDO/CLO/corporate bond defaults  (more commonly known as CDS) has increased by 5% in the last few weeks.

[https://www.ft.com/content/2fb81482-5257-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f](https://www.ft.com/content/2fb81482-5257-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f)

See, the problem is that *someone's* got to be bagholding these risky ass, expensively hedged debt securities. Large financial institutions unfortunately have more than two brain cells, and especially after 2009 they've learned their lesson quite well to not hold on these ticking timebombs. So we've got institutional sums of  money, institutions who want to collect on high yield debt securities,  institutions who want to collect CDS payments, institutions on the other  side of the CDS contract wanting to collect on the default payout, and  on the other end, small businesses that wouldn't have a business case if  they didn't have access to enough upfront cash financed with debt  chasing a pipe dream.

That leaves a big question, and that question is how it keeps on ending up that these small, risk-laden businesses get funded? The answer to that question are *Business Development Companies*. These  companies are publicly traded, they can be publicly financed, and  they can also take out loans themselves from large banks because hey,  they're not as at risk of going tits up as those small time pissant risk-laden companies. So these BDCs take the capital they've raised and  bankroll all the risky shit that banks wouldn't want to touch. And they  diversify their investments to make sure that their endeavors in  financing risky companies don't go to shit. And they package up these loans into securitized financial instruments and we go right back into  the shit.

So, how do we profit from knowing that everyone's getting ready for these corporate debt capital bubbles to pop? Short the fuck outta BDCs. In particular, ones more retarded and higher leveraged than ourselves, like Prospect Capital.

Prospect Capital | NASDAQ: PSEC Market Cap: 1.79b; **Net Debt: 2.003b**

They deal in a lot of debt capital, but what makes them a standout is that they deal primarily with sub-lien/junior level debt. This means that **they are paid last in the lending totem pole** while leveraging themselves to the fucking tits. On top of that, they also like playing on the risky side of loans, with 3 consumer loan companies and 1 ""not a loan company"" company. With unemployment rising, we can expect people to default on loans in a credit crunch. And these retards who own sub-lien debt will be paid last if there's a default.

The autist bulls are trying to spin a new story: *“Yeah, the economy is basically shut down for 1, 2 or 3 months but then everything comes back roaring into action*” Just watch CNBC for an hour to know what I'm talking about. They are right that we're not going to go Mad max. But even in the best case scenario, consumer behavior will be severely affected.

However, once lockdowns around the world are starting to be lifted, don't expect people to walk into e.g. Starbucks like they used to before. **This is not priced in.**

Why is this? 

1) Well, a lot people are still gonna try to avoid large crowds because they haven't been infected (yet). Doctors and institutions don't say everyone will get infected. This will play a significant role until a vaccine is developed. 

2) A lot of people have just been laid off (and people still with a job saw how easy it was for others to get laid off). ~75% or so might go straight back to their original job, but with the knowledge that their employer will let them go if they have to shut down for a few weeks. Of course this can be a good thing as people can get benefits. However, this will result in a major risk-averse consumer trend that is hard to break. Some people were perhaps considering buying a new 47-inch TV before? However, after the lockdown people rather keep money at hand, as people perceive their jobs, the economy and the world as more fragile than they could ever imagine. Hence, people will save up for future bad times and avoid frivolous purchases. This is absolutely disastrous for consumer spending, and therefore the economy as a whole.

Of course, there will be a slight peak after lockdowns. People will spend their $1000 on stupid shit once they are able to. But this will not hold.",2020-03-20 21:26:28

I know, I know, this isn’t the time for Calls, but... There’s a real opportunity to pick up some cheap calls for a company that is set to clean up in a recession. 

Here’s why I’m bullish on Ollie’s Bargain Outlet ($Olli): 

- They’re a discount retailer (a la Big Lots) that specializes in picking up product via close outs, bankruptcy and overstocks. 
- Because they also sell food (among many other things) they’ve been allowed to stay open, while most of their retail competitors have closed. 
- As the recession progresses, they’re only going to see an increase in consumer demand AND an increase in supply (as more companies fail and liquidate). 
- They just released their earnings yesterday, and while they missed earnings by -3%, a company like this is likely to perform better as the economy gets worse. 

Bottom line, Ollie is a bottom feeder. As retail dies, they’ll thrive. This is their time.

The Fed just announced today that they're going to start buying Muni bonds, so the liquidity issues in this market that are causing the discounts on these ETFs ($VTEB and $MUB are also trading at a discount, albeit a smaller one, as those own only investment grade muni bonds which are more liquid) are likely going to end soon, as the Fed starts buying: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/20/federal-reserve-muni-bond-market-coronavirus/

If you buy blocks of 100 shares of $HYD (currently trading at around $47.20) and sell ITM calls against them (I went with 4/17 $47c for $5.20), and then hold them until expiry, you'll likely be assigned, and get to keep the $500 in option premium. Your risk here is if $HYD continues to drop which is very unlikely given the current magnitude of the discount, and the recent Fed announcement. You'll also get a tax-free dividend while you're holding the shares since $HYD pays out monthly and muni bonds are tax-free.",2020-03-20 20:33:21

DD,Goldman Sachs - global overexposure + repo market analysis,126,flw4yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flw4yg/goldman_sachs_global_overexposure_repo_market/,28,1584744193.0,"I'm not a very good writer (English is my second language) so please forgive any errors.

u/Joesocktwo posted this [interesting analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe5s7e/the_fed_repos_are_an_attempt_to_prop_up_the/) on repo market a few weeks back. TL;DR: US banks are lending imaginary money called eurodollars to shady developing banks, and this shadow lending is causing a liquidity crisis

But that got me thinking about banks, specifically Goldman Sachs and BoA (we're focusing on Goldman today).

Per their [2019 earnings report](https://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/pdfs/2019-q4-results.pdf), **40%** of their net revenue is from global markets. Of the 40%, this global market is divided into FICCs (fixed interest rate, commodities, currency) and equities.

**This 40% doesn't include the OTHER global exposure they have, which is under Investment Banking (21% earnings). GS offers both corporate lending and financial services such as underwriting, auditing, CIO/CFO for IPO offerings, M&As etc.** 

For example, if Startup X wanted to be do an IPO in HKEX (Hong Kong Exchange), Goldman Sachs makes significant money off as an underwriter. [what an underwriter is](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp) 

On top of that, they have global exposure in Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management. First, Goldman Sachs was one of the bigger banks to establish themselves early in China in 1997. During which, China experienced a huge boom in middle class and also in millionaires -- [4.4millionaires as of 2019](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/21/china-overtakes-us-in-rankings-of-worlds-richest-people), and obviously Goldman wanted a slice of those management fees. 

To give an idea, GS has [84 locations worldwide](https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/locations.html), of these locations:

* 8 of them are in China, centered around Beijing and HK/Shenzhen
* 3 of them in Brazil
* 11 of them are in EU/UK countries Italy, Spain, France, Germany etc with known lockdowns or Coronavirus cases

These locations are office locations and do not count the partnerships GS has with other companies for instance their joint venture with China-based securities and brokerage firm Gao Hua (15% stake) etc.

**Therefore, repo markets aside, Goldman Sachs is hugely exposed to the effects of Coronavirus as over half their branch locations and financial offerings, investments, corporate lending are in countries under lockdown or severely hit**

We also have definite proof that GS is heavily involved in developing countries examples:

* [2014 Libya Wealth Fund Lawsuit](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-19/goldman-sachs-drops-bid-to-throw-out-libyan-wealth-fund-suit)

* [2018 Lawsuit in Indonesia with Property Tycoon Hanson International](https://www.reuters.com/article/indonesia-goldman-sachs-lawsuit/goldman-loses-indonesia-court-appeal-in-hanson-share-ownership-dispute-idUSL4N1UG24D)

* [2019 1MDB Corruption scandal](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Goldman-Sachs-in-talks-to-pay-2bn-to-settle-1MDB-probe-source2) <- Netflix Dirty Money has a great episode on this too

Also, of all Wall Street Banks, GS and BOA are the ones that really recovered to their pre-2008 prices. In Jan 2008, GS was trading at 198 a share before dropping to 67 a share in Dec 2008. In Jan 2020, GS trading at 231 a share, and currently trading at 146 a share. 

Here's my speculation:

* Coronavirus has an incubation time between 14-27 days. The short term impact is already seen and mostly priced in, with the large first plunge at the end of Feb.

* However due to the long incubation and asymptomatic spread, there is usually a second spike in cases about 1-1.5 months later.

* As we can see from other countries, even IF the local community spread is stopped, the number of cases continue to rise due to imported cases (Imported cases refer to travelers arriving to the country, students returning from overseas and other citizen recall)

* Therefore the actual extent of lockdown differs based on how many citizens were abroad - these imported cases EXTEND the period of lockdown and social distancing even when no new community cases appear

* Most companies have only changed their earnings guidance for 1st quarter, or in some cases like General Electric who supplies to Boeing [have not changed their guidance at all](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/15/general-electric-maintains-guidance-but-for-how-mu.aspx)

* Summer is one of the biggest consumer seasons in the USA; since restaurants and tourism make full use of extended hours daylight savings, then you have summer blockbuster movies etc etc

* Effects are multiple: SMEs gonna start defaulting, chinese factories still not at full capacity, chinese/SEA millionaires not gonna make huge investments, wealth management not looking so hot, recession is a bad year for IPOs, so companies that were planning to move forward with IPOs aren't going to, developing countries gonna struggle with repayments and their currency will fall against the US dollar (already seeing signs of this 100 PH Peso = 1.95 USD)

* Banks going to get hit after 2 consecutive quarters of poor earnings, particularly true for super exposed global banks (BOA is another global bank, you just have to look at their earnings under Merill Lynch since they have so many spun off divisions)

DD,[DD] - Marketing Agencies are going to crunch hard - Omnicom Group - $OMC GOING DEEP,44,flw34h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flw34h/dd_marketing_agencies_are_going_to_crunch_hard/,21,1584744000.0,"**TL;DR $OMC 4/17 50p**

I'm sure I like many of you **🌈🐻**have been looking for another industry to make some sweet tendies.

&#x200B;

To my surprise a big marketing corporation like Omnicom Group has yet to show signs of how hugely affected they've been (and going to be) by the beer virus...

&#x200B;

This giant marketing corporation has majority ownership in dozens upon dozens of small to large marketing agencies. All of which rely upon contracts from businesses. One of the first things major business will cut when readjusting budgets for this year will be marketing. Alot of whom have already done so.

&#x200B;

One of the agencies it has ownership of is Clemenger Group which hugely relies upon having contracts with big brands so they can hire sales representatives go out to retail stores for training staff members and sales promotion.  No fucking way that's going to continue with how quickly retail is dying.

&#x200B;

[And these marketing agencies are already aware of hard they are going to feel it.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advertisers-stare-coronavirus-abyss-133006475.html)

>LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - The cancellation of major sporting events and the decimation of the luxury, entertainment and travel industries is delivering a hammer blow to a global advertising industry that was already reeling from years of tech-led turmoil.  
>  
>The sudden withdrawal of a chunk of the $600 billon of pure advertising money that goes via agencies onto media platforms such as Facebook and Google, broadcasters, magazines and billboards will be felt far and wide.  
>  
>""This is a very sudden, immediate and significant hit to people's revenue and bottom line. A lot of people will go to the wall as a result of it,"" Michael Moszynski, chief executive and founder of the LONDON Advertising agency, told Reuters.

&#x200B;

Looking into Omnicom Group Q4 2019 [earnings report.](http://s2.q4cdn.com/400719266/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/2019-12-31-Omnicom-Group-Earnings-Release.pdf)

Their revenue for 2019 was $14,953,000,000 already down from $15,290,000,000 in 2018.

With a salary and service cost of $10,972,000,000 and net income of $1,339,000,000.That's a whole lot of salaries to pay. Looks like we're going to see a lot of layoffs.

&#x200B;

I suspect their revenue streams are going to dry up quickly with a lot of big brands pulling out of contracts all year around.

Was looking into $SYY premarket today to see that they had some great news. 

1. They are withdrawing their 3 year guidance plan in response to the CV pandemic. 

2. They’re cutting expenses with decreased demand in their product. 

3. They are speaking to the government in hopes to give restaurants a bailout.

4. They are borrowing a couple billion from their bank to help with liquidity. 

5. They are planning on not pushing for a government bailout. 

6. They are speaking with grocery stores in hopes to become providers for them.

Now here’s where they’re fucked. 

1. Every company should be responding to the coronavirus pandemic.

2. Lowering expenses = firing everybody. Being able to safely borrow money as a result of them not being able to spend any money on their product.

3. They want the restaurant’s to receive a bailout because they know damn well the government isn’t going to do anything for them. They rely on the food industry, and since that is currently getting fucked in the ass, they will be getting fucked in the ass. The government isn’t going to bailout food. Our government has no money to give after the inevitable airline and cruise company bailouts. 

4. Grocery stores are fucked too besides Walmart. If your supply chain is garbage, you won’t have any product to transport to your grocery stores.

DD,PUT on NVST (Envista) JUN $9 strike,1,fltzo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fltzo4/put_on_nvst_envista_jun_9_strike/,46,1584735089.0,"**TLDR: PUT NVST JUN/SEPT  $9 Strike**

Envista owns 30 dental brands and sells solely dental equipment and consumables.

1. Dentists have all been lock-downed in Europe and US. (70% of revenues). Nobody is going to be buying dental consumables or new dental equipment.
2. Even if dentists were to resume operations in July, consumer confidence will be quite badly affected. How many consumers are going to purchase $8k braces in a recession?
3. Yes, stock has gone down 60%. However, there is **high risk of bankruptcy.**

* Envista was spun out of Danaher in Sept 2019. Before spinning Envista out, parent company loaded it with a shit ton of debt ($1.3 billion).
* Envista has only $20m of cash in US. There is $200m of cash on balance sheet, however, $180m is held in foreign countries such as China, with heavy withdrawal restrictions.
* The $1.3b of debt has very strict covenants including a Debt to EBITDA of 3.75 to 1. Failing which, the whole amount of $1.3b immediately comes due. Currently their Debt to EBITDA is 3.1 ($1.3b of debt; last 4 quarters EBITDA up to Dec 2019 of $420.7m). **With just 1 loss-making quarter,** likely 2020 Q2, their DEBT to EBITDA will spiral to 4 or more, triggering **$1.3b of debt due immediately**. At that point, no bank in their right mind will loan $1.3b to a company in such bad situation.

**a) do a straight short.** That works too.

b) hold to expiry for the June contracts

As we all know, COVID-19 is currently buttfucking American markets, and turning Europe into one big lockdown zone one country at a time. We also know that during this time, rent, mortgages, etc are suspended, and when this happens, landlords and realtor groups lose money faster than $MSFT 200c 3/20 gang. I’ve seen several posts on this sub about countries such as Brazil that are about to get the fucc from corona virus, but one I haven’t seen is Japan, which got me to thinking, and then to doing research up till three in the morning pouring over news articles and data like a dirty college student cramming before a final. So here’s what I found. 

Japan doesn’t prop up their markets like China does (RIP to those FXI puts you made in February) and has American levels of stupidity when it comes to handling testing and treatment, and they’re still letting people enter from mainland China. 

https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/05/asia/japan-coronavirus-infection-levels-hnk-intl/index.html

“But while the official number of people infected with coronavirus in Hokkaido may now be in the 80s, the actual number is likely to be ten times higher, said Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido university. Nishiura, who is assisting the government in creating statistical models to help predict the spread of the virus, said the estimated figure is consistent with what he had seen in the Chinese city of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the outbreak.”

(Additional article on failure to test)

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/japan-elderly-coronavirus.html

Not only that, but according to census data almost 20% of Japanese people are daily smokers according to data from 2018, and COVID-19 attacks the respiratory system. You do the math. 

What’s the point of all of this? A ticker, a strike price, and a date. Japanese real estate to get big fucc with at same rate as America, and we want stonks with healthy volume so therefore;

Your 11 year bull market that thrived on low interest rates, and low unemployment encouraged a lot of big dick financial risk taking behavior by large corporations who similar to us kept saying ""Can't go tits up."" This in turn led to a corporate debt bubble that was highlighted as ""Risky"" by the federal reserves November 2019 financial stability report.

>Business debt levels are high compared with either business assets or GDP, with the riskiest firms accounting for most of the increase in debt in recent years.

When companies rack up large amounts of debt, they sell them to cucks as Corporate Bonds. This is known as the corporate bond market. Cucks who own corporate bonds make money by being paid in interest on those bonds.

But what happens when you have a global pandemic where businesses are forced to shut down for an undermined amount of time? Revenue streams dry up and those companies are now at risk of being unable to pay out the interest payments to the bond holders. This results in a default. Once a company defaults creditors set out on horses with massive dildos to fuck the life out of these companies and force them into bankruptcy. Usually by selling off all their assets to pay back the bond holders and creditors.

There are corporate bond ETF's that you can buy puts on, and that's probably what I'll put most of my money into. The corporate bond ETFs below are the ones I was able to find with the most Volume and OI.

* $HYG
* $LQD
* $JNK

Believe it or not, fucking $GME GameStop has issued corporate bonds GUH! and $ALGT allegiant travel has some floating around too. I believe those two companies are to high risk of defaulting given the current conditions.

I read a post by a leverage banker on here yesterday that said the defaults are going to start soon, so I believe this upcoming week would be a good time to get into your positions.

\-Good Luck Retards.

$TEVA 

* Largest Generic Drug Manufacturer by a long shot. No Pharma company comes even close to their global manufacturing presence and capacity. Huge API supplier. With current increased demand due to the virus I expect API revs to be far greater than expected. Also a major manufacturer of Hydroxychloroquine which shows promising results in treating COVID19 with the use of antibiotics. They will donate 10 million doses of this drug and provide as many as necessary for clinical trials. **Maybe state AGs will drop the lawsuit with these large donations(opioid and price fixing)?** (EDIT: Definitely a long shot but why would a company donate to a govt that is suing them into bankruptcy?) They may not invent the ""cure"" but they may very easily be involved in the manufacturing of it when it arrives. With a global solid dose manufacturing presence and distribution they will be the best bet in delivering medicine to the patients during high demand. Also TEVA announced a few days ago that they have not had issues with supply chains during this time.  [https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/covid-19-big-pharma-confident-on-supply-chain-integrity](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/covid-19-big-pharma-confident-on-supply-chain-integrity) 
   * At the end of the day I am a big fan of generic drugs and the benefits they have for all of us using them. They have the smallest margins but are vital in our healthcare system. **If TEVA bankrupts the generic market will drastically inflate worldwide.** They saved US healthcare system over $40bn. [https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/teva-boasts-its-generic-meds-saved-us-healthcare-system-41-9-billion](https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/teva-boasts-its-generic-meds-saved-us-healthcare-system-41-9-billion) 
   * Disclaimer: I am holding 6000 shares at $15.07.

$PG

* Huge pharma giant that makes many of the household items and OTC stuff. Vicks Dayquil, head+shoulders, charmin, mr. clean, oral b etc. **All of this stuff seems to be flying off the shelves due to panic. Maybe worth a gamble for Q1 ER.** 

$TWTR

* In the past year twitter has vastly changed the way they both track ER and daily users. They have fixed ad. bugs from last year and have been ramping up ad revenue. Now they track mDAUs(monetizable daily active users) rather than DAUs to give investors an idea of how many users they actually make money on. **I expected a major Q1 ER beat on both numbers along with major increase in mDAUs. Virus trending constantly, people panicking to find out whats going on, politics, etc. and im still getting ads on my mobile**. I understand why the stock is down. Cutting ad expenses is the easiest way for companies to cut costs at times of economic downfall. I still think other companies are jumping in to advertise(i.e. entertainment). Im still getting ads. Can very easily be a $60 stock EoY. Im a fan of twitter and initiated a position this week will be slowly adding to it as we approach a bottom.

$OXY

* This is my gamble stock for this year. I expect CEO Vicki Hollub to be removed this week as Icahn took a major stake. Trump said to have plans on meeting with the oil guys to resolve the Russia/Saudi Arabia dick measuring contest. **Bonds updated to junk and people think bankruptcy is near considering that $30 a barrel is no where near sustainable. However, any positive news can rocket this back to the 30s.**

**Healthcare Statistics**

Out of “developed” economies, Mexico has literally the lowest number of standard hospital beds per person

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_hospital\_beds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds)

Mexico has \~1.4 bed per thousand people. Compares this to other countries where the virus has spread dramatically – Italy for example, has \~3.2 beds thousand people (which is even considered low-tier).

Now the more important statistic is the number of ICU beds per person. Mexico has 2.33 ICU beds *per 100,000 people.* This compares to the US at 34.7, Italy at 12.5, South Korea at 10.6, etc. Not good.

County Data: [https://www.statista.com/chart/21105/number-of-critical-care-beds-per-100000-inhabitants/](https://www.statista.com/chart/21105/number-of-critical-care-beds-per-100000-inhabitants/)

Mexico Data: [https://www.animalpolitico.com/2020/03/pocas-camas-hospital-baja-proporcion-medicos-enfrentaria-mexico-covid-19/](https://www.animalpolitico.com/2020/03/pocas-camas-hospital-baja-proporcion-medicos-enfrentaria-mexico-covid-19/)

Mexico has a generally unhealthy population. For example, they have the third highest obesity rate in the OECD (\~33.0%). They also have the second lowest amount of federal spending on healthcare services in the OECD. [http://www.oecd.org/economy/mexico-economic-snapshot/](http://www.oecd.org/economy/mexico-economic-snapshot/)

Death rates are going to the moon once the virus begins to accelerate. The healthcare system will totally fail. People will panic, riots will start to take place, and labor availability will go to zero.

**Government Intervention**

The president of Mexico is admittedly ignoring the virus and the inevitable impact it will have on Mexico’s economy. He has publically said things like “I have great faith that we will move our dear Mexico forward, that misfortunes and pandemics won’t affect us”

Mexico has performed a a very small number of tests for the virus to date. Latest data shows that they have performed 278 tests (likely more by now but not by much) – expect the number of cases to increase immensely as test are conducted. Let’s compare the number of tests per capita:

Mexico: 278 tests / 134MM people: 0.000002 per person

United States: 103,945 tests / 331MM people: 0.00031 per person

Italy: 206,886 tests / 59MM people: 0.0035 per person

Canada: 113,121 tests / 38MM people: 0.0030 per person

Brazil: 2,927 tests / 214MM people: 0.00001 per person

India: 14,514 tests / 1.4BN people: 0.00001 per person

Mexico is still taking a business-as-usual approach, and has not yet closed borders, dock, airports, etc. nor have they declared a state of emergency, ordered businesses to shut down or instituted work from home policies (they have now begun to “encourage” some of these, including social distancing). The only measures the President has put in place is literally praying to amulets that will provide a protective shield – seriously.

**Mexican Economy**

Services represents over 60% of the economies GDP, including sectors such as transportation, commerce, warehousing, restaurant and hotels, arts and entertainment, health, education, financial and banking services. Once the virus begins to take hold of the country, the big part of this sector will completely halt to a stop – 60% of the economy.

The energy sector is also a major driver of GDP for Mexico. Mexican oil reached $14.0 per barrel last week.

The manufacturing sector in Mexico is another major component of the economy, specifically car manufacturing. As labor availability falls through the floor, plants will not be able to operate and will eventually shut down. The triple whammy of supply chain disruptions, carmaker shutdowns, and a collapse oil in prices are going to kill this economy. Fitch, Moody’s and S&P’s all have a negative outlook on Pemex’s creditworthiness, meaning that there is almost definitely going to be further downgrades as the year progresses.

Peak to trough in 2008, EWW fell \~55.0%. This recession in Mexico will be much worse and longer drawn out the 2008 recession, destroying both supply and demand. EWW is currently down, 2020 peak to trough, about 40%.

TL;DR: Mexican economy is going to absolutely tank. Buy puts on EWW.

I think he should really let the scientist and doctors decide if this works and not push some potential snake oil on everyone.

The hyped up [study](https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf) they did in France on Hydroxychloroquine has all sorts of problems. First, n=20. Then what was or is actually measured there? In this context, it is of particular importance that the Marseille study based on the measurement of viral load in the nasopharynx is not a randomised double-blind study with only 20 volunteers. Whether young or old, with or without symptoms, whether slightly, severely or not at all ill or cured in the meantime: The study was carried out as the patients came in. Thus, the basis of any professional statistical survey is not given. Also 3 patients started the trial, then got worse, were moved to ICU and died. They were removed from the sample. 

Since the virus load was measured in the nasopharynx and not in the lungs, there is a high risk of further misinterpretations. Because what the patient has in his throat has nothing to do with how the disease progresses clinically. Maybe chloroquine does work. But the way this study was done, we're not one bit smarter.

Up for discussion at [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreets/) (and, I presume, throughout the rest of the market) is the question of whether stocks and bonds are positively or negatively correlated (and, of course, the same  question with respect to stocks and gold).

&#x200B;

As a data analyst, I downloaded some Yahoo Finance price data and used my own analytical methods to try to put an end to this question once and  for all.  My conclusions are as follows:

1. You cannot rely on the market to *always* do anything.  The market is completely crazy and often defies trends, particularly in periods of volatility, except:
2. The American indices have consistently moved together, even in times of volatility, and
3. US Treasury yields (10-Year) and gold seem to generally oppose each other, though with a bit weaker correlation.

&#x200B;

With  respect to the question of stocks and treasuries, it seems much less appropriate to view these as linked assets at all.  In some periods, these have correlated positively; in others, negatively; and in some, not at all.

&#x200B;

Beyond  this, I'll let the data speak for itself, as it bears witness to the pure insanity of the markets--especially within the past few weeks.

&#x200B;

With  that said, a few pointers on how to navigate the visualizations, as they are quite different than most stock charts.  The X and Y axes each represent the closing price (in the first visualization) or daily price  change (in the second and third) of one security.  Each dot represents  one point in time, showing the closing price (or daily price change) for one security on one axis compared with the same information for a  different security on the other.  The progression of time is represented  by the changing color of the dot, with a key at the top of the visualization; unlike in most charts, time does not have its own axis.  Here, you can ""follow"" the progression of time by starting with the red  dots and moving toward the green ones.

&#x200B;

One  additional note: this is not investment advice.  Do with it what you will, but I take no responsibility for your actions--smart or otherwise.

tl;dr market r fukd, buy puts.

The first point, so obvious even an idiot like me can get it, is the belief that SPY is going to keep dropping.

The Great Unwinding, predicts that SPY will drop to 217-213. After this, there will be a technical rally, built on top of  bailouts/relief/etc. up to 250-270. Following this rally,  there will be a second significant drop down to 180-157.

Along with this is discussion regarding the value of the dollar and that for the short term, dollar will be king until inflation or whatever gets out of hand. Likewise, with the rally there will be significant IV crush, meaning straight calls will have less return even if you’re right (from When Market Bounce... post).

This  discussion suggests to hedge against IV crush, if one decides to try and  time the market and catch that upward swing with calls, to purchase VIX  puts with the SPY calls. The trick of this to make the IV neutral is to find options where the SPYc Vega is opposite that of VIXp delta. His example is Vega 0.24 and then delta  -0.24. So if pursuing this you’ll have to read a lot of chains to match them. The downside to this is if the market continues down or you expire before the bounce, or whatever, you are double fucked. Another downside to VIX is that it trades like a euro and can’t be exercised before expiry so doesnt experience as much movement overall and may be harder to fill.

So. Along with all of this, there were a few other recommendations.

UUP  calls - this tracks the dollar. While we expect the dollar to be strong in the short term, you would want to be nimble and exit quickly.  UUP tends to trend along with DXY/$DX. If $DX is hitting 105-107, that is likely when you want to be exiting the UUP position, again according to the Great Unwinding author.

Furthermore, when the dollar reverses, whether due to fed action or what have you, gold will likely finely take off. Look to GLD and maybe JNG calls. Could enter these positions whenever, best during a low swing, with late summer/fall expirations.

In regards to timeline. This is the extremely tricky part. The drop has happened very quickly, so it’s possible that the bounce and second fall can happen quickly again. It’s also possible that fed action may try to slow down the second fall. Obviously if we could all time the market the rest would be easy, but the point is while I’m sure the numbers are possible, and the bounce and fall before we start the real road to recovery are true, the timeline may fuck everything for us autists.

So, couple scenarios could play out:

1 - SPY hits 217-213 and rebounds to 240-270, before subsequently falling to 180-157. This is the Great Unwinding thesis.

2 - SPY keeps on falling well past 217, bounces at some point, and falls to even deeper lows, but who knows how far up and when.

3 - Aliens invade and this is all irrelevant.

The first thesis seems to believe that the rebound could happen as soon as this week or next, could sustain for about a week, and then fall -  unsure how quickly, could be weeks or months.

The second thesis seems to rely more on the real-world domino of corona on the market, and while doesn’t  inherently disagree with the premise of thesis 1, believes that in the next 1-2 weeks the corona and unemployment numbers,  quarantines, etc will hit the market like a sledgehammer and we’re gonna keep on dropping until the bailouts/relief kicks the bounce off. By that point we will have dropped to 200-180, and the second drop will have us in 150-100.

Personally, I think there might be a bit of a combo.

We may  have a technical bump at 217-213 but it will not be sustained and won’t  reach the highs predicted. And we will continue to drill. There may be a  much more sustained bounce, which if it happens  I don’t know at what value it will happen or what we might go too. I do think that on the second large fall we might go quite deep, as the number of afflicted hits the hundreds of thousands if not millions,  unemployment doesn’t drop, etc. As for proof to support this, I am an idiot, have none, and don't trust a random guy on the internet.

&#x200B;

So long and short what the fuck do we do.

I have  4/17 200p and 150p. These will likely need to be sold within the next week or two. If we cross below 200 before April I will definitely sell them. I may sell as early as tomorrow but I think we have further to drop before the bounce, so I’m willing to let them run a bit. With this, one could lock in their profit early,  and then double down for further out puts (during the bounce so you get your money’s worth).

Personally,  I’m dubious about trying to time the bounce and how high it might go.  If you wanted to dip your toes into this, you could buy lower OTM calls (230-245ish) between 2  week and 2 month expiry. I’m sure at some  point in there they’ll be ITM. However, with this you would need to combine it with the VIXp to combat IV crush, which complicates things.

IMO - sit out trying to time the bounce with calls. Save the cash and be ready for when the bounce does  happen, buy more puts, deeper OTM, and further out. When the bounce happens I would start buying puts anytime after we hit 240. Additionally, look at VXX calls at this time.

So to wrap this stupid thing up, here are possible strike/dates:

\-SPYc 240-270 2wk-2mos out

——tied with VIXp. Find an opposing Vega/delta within same expiration time frame

\-UUPc \~1-3mos out, in the $28-30 strike range

\-SPYp 220-200 now-may (exit early! when the bounce happens you may be bear trapped)

\-SPYp 200-150 May-aug

\-SPYp 150-100 sep-nov

\-VXXc 60-80 1-2mos after we bounce

\-GLD/JNG I need to look at this more, but far out expiry calls. Fall or 2021. Anyone with knowledge here please chime in. Both for when to get in (I think I saw when it drops to 1300-1000) and what strike/date. My buddy also suggested considering long silver and GDXJ.

\-Real estate. The further down the rabbit hole we go, this will be a safe haven for longer term, buy actual real estate or REITs to catch the market rebound, and be prepared to hold for YEARS.

&#x200B;

And as someone who works in healthcare, it is blindingly clear that ""we"" are not doing enough and are truly fucked. I'll get on my personal soapbox here to say you need to take this virus seriously, this isn't the flu. It is not ONLY an old person disease. Even if you only catch a mild case, you are likely to spread it, and are putting at others at significant risk. Wash your hands, self-quarantine, and start stocking up gradually for the second drop which may really fuck this country over. Yes, this is not an extinction level event, this country will survive, but a LOT of people are going to die, when it could have been avoided.

In before ""Sir this is a Wendys/McDonalds"" and ""Just don't dance.""

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT: So a couple people in the comments/DMs mentioned a couple other scenarios, I just wanted to share with y'all.

Scenario 4 - Bounce DOESN'T happen. We keep on sailing on down (not a straight drill to 0 you permabulls, yes there will be bumps along the way). We land somewhere in 170-100, bounce along the bottom, before crawling back up.

Scenario 5 - Bounce DOES happen -  but our second fall down isn't nearly as bad as people think. We maybe come back down to low 200s, but then we sit there for awhile. Trump's latest comments implying sending people back to work combined with robust fed/gov action may cause this.

MACD is still trending down, pring KST hasn't reached negative yet, and Williams R and Stochastic just reached oversold territory. in 2008, those momentum indicators were red for at least a year before picking back up.

TLDR; 70 Million Americans are on lockdown. COVID-19 is spreading in the US faster than it did in Italy. Italian deaths/day are still increasing. State jobs reports are coming out this Thursday and based on unemployment claims it’s going to be terrible.  
 

Analysis: Longer interval momentum indicators are still decidedly bearish however KDJ on all intervals is decidedly oversold. MACD on 1D is also converging slightly. KDJ convergences and Net Volume convergences are indicating early signs of a bull-trap. Although in the week ahead bearish positions are still justifiable positions longer term are exposed to too much risk to justify. Possible 2% gap down or more on Monday. Keep watching futures and news to confirm. Look for short/put entries EOW or early in the next week if bull trap is confirmed. Major resistance around 260 would be the ideal entry.

DD,A Market Liquidity Theory of the Current Financial Crisis,743,fn8l0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn8l0z/a_market_liquidity_theory_of_the_current/,280,1584944780.0,"Huge update from the Fed this morning: https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323b.htm

I'm not going to have a chance to look through this in detail this morning, but it looks like the Fed might be engaging in a massive loan program and taking just about anything as collateral.

This is going to be a long post and analysis that I have written as much to get my thoughts in order as much to post on here for any feedback or criticism.

Essentially, like many on here, I do not believe that the current situation is a temporary down-turn, but a full blown financial crisis. We have already been hit with the initial shock of this crisis, so the question becomes: what comes next? Helping us understand what is fundamentally happening in the market will aid in making intelligent future predictions and investments. That leads to the question: what exactly is happening in the market right now? What caused us to suddenly drive off a cliff? And is there any way we can save it? Unlikely many here, I do not believe that COVID-19 is the actual underlying crisis. In my opinion, our economy was basically the end stages of a Jenga game, and COVID-19 is just the swift breeze knocking the whole thing over.

As I started looking for the next big market move, I started to wonder who was going to feel the most pain in these markets. Some reading led me to the thought that what we were seeing in the markets was a liquidity issue, and that companies with poor credit ratings will be most affected. I posted about this a couple of days ago, and several others came to the same conclusion as me. [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/flvrgr/bond_market_implosion_incoming_how_to_short/) [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the_great_unwinding_why_wsb_will_keep_losing/) [3](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhaofo/short_investment_grade_bonds_lqd_impending/). There are other obliviously other problems in the market at the moment, but this analysis will focus on this problem in particular.

I now strongly believe that this hypothesis was correct, even if my initial reasoning and analysis was flawed. I outline a theory, followed by some supporting evidence, and finally some speculation. Finally, I don't think the Fed understands the actual problem the market is facing right now, nor does it have the tools to deal with it.

There are three prerequisites here: repos, collateral transformation, and rehypothecated collateral

/u/Variation-Separate has already written an excellent technical analysis, and explains repos in part I. I will assume you have already read that section. [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the_great_unwinding_why_wsb_will_keep_losing/)

The basic idea behind collateral transforms is this: Your company needs some short-term liquid cash. In order for someone to give you this cash, you need collateral. You only have risky assets (such as junk bonds), but no one will accept them as collateral precisely because they are risky. Everyone in the market wants a secure asset (such as a Treasury). Instead of giving up, you go out and find someone who will loan you their Treasury and accept your junk bonds as collateral. You then use that Treasury to obtain the cash you need. This process can be repeated among many parties in order to create a ""collateral chain"".

Finally, we have rehypothecated collateral: Someone comes to you and wants to borrow an assets for a short period of time (such as a stock). They give you another asset (such as cash) as collateral in exchange for the stock. You know the borrower won't be back to collect this collateral for a while, so you invest that collateral to make money off of it in the meantime.

As /u/Variation-Separate explains, there have been problems in the repo market recently, and the Fed has acted as the believe appropriate. However, this is not the first time the Fed has run into this problem . In fact, we had a problem a problem in the repo market just in Sept 2019 and [""Not only did the spike in the repo rate come as a surprise to the New York Fed, but they also haven't been able to normalize it as quickly as they thought they could""](https://www.pionline.com/markets/repo-blowup-was-fueled-big-banks-hedge-funds-bis). Finally, let's consider that even though the fed has offered to pump massive amounts of liquidity into the market, [banks aren't taking it and are quickly repaying that which they do take](https://www.newser.com/story/288474/the-fed-is-lending-1t-a-day.html).

What exactly is going on then? The Fed tries to pump liquidity into the economy, and nothing happens. The reason for this is that the Fed knows that it doesn't understand the underlying problem in the market, and knows that is powerless to stop it. The Fed is trying to unleash every tool in its toolbox on the hope that if it just throws enough money into the market, *eventually* the problem will go away.

So what is the root problem? Essentially, liquidity. More specifically, collateral transformations and rehypothecated collateral. In fact, this has been written about extensively: [4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2019/09/25/the-real-story-of-the-repo-market-meltdown-and-what-it-means-for-bitcoin/#60f02f667caa) [5](https://alhambrapartners.com/2018/11/20/2018-the-collateral-case/), with Snider in particular making a strong case that today's crisis fits the analysis of the collateral markets that he provided in 2018: [6](https://alhambrapartners.com/2020/03/20/fire-jay-powell-immediately-the-overwhelming-proof-for-the-collateral-case/)

How are collateral transformations and rehypothecated collateral affecting liquidity in the markets? There are numerous ways, but let's start with 2:

Let's say someone gives you cash as collateral, and you rehypothecate it as described in the example. However, instead of putting the cash in a safe asset, knowing you have to repay it, you put it in a very risky, high-yield asset such as a junk bond or MBS. Things go wrong, you lose your money and can't pay back your end of the repo. This is exactly what AIG did during the 2008 crisis. [7](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2018/07/27/in_capitalism_failure_isnt_rewarded_and_repeated_103366.html)

Now let's say you engage in a long chain of collateral transformations. You start with a really risk assets, trade that for a sligtly less risky asset, trade that for a moderately risky asset, etc, until you eventually get a pristine asset. Now anyone along that chain can rehypothecate their collateral into some risky investment, causing a huge number of problems. Not to mention that if you, for some reason, can't fulfill your end of the repo, you screw a whole chain of people who have traded with you.

Now, if we are in a strong market, these problems won't arise too often. But what happens if, say, a virus comes out of now where causing wide-spread economic disruptions? Now, maybe those risky investments that would have paid out more often than not aren't pay out at all, causing systemic problems.

Now let's add a couple of things that exacerbate this problem even further:

These chains get so complicated that no one even knows who owns which assets anymore [4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/caitlinlong/2019/09/25/the-real-story-of-the-repo-market-meltdown-and-what-it-means-for-bitcoin/#60f02f667caa)

When these chains collateral transformations start to fail, people may become less willing to take the risk of engaging in them [5](https://alhambrapartners.com/2018/11/20/2018-the-collateral-case/)

All of this caused heavy regulation on the exchange of collateral by primary lenders after the 2008 crisis. This has pushed these transactions into dark markets where we don't really understand what is going on. Here is my hypothesis, heavily taken from Snider's analysis:

Corporations have become heavily reliant on short-term lending for liquidity. However, most of them don't have pristine assets to exchange for cash, or DisneyBucks to float them through hard times. So what to do? You engage in collateral transformations: keep exchanging your junk assets until you get the pristine assets you need to get liquid cash. A bunch of corporations do this over and over again, and eventually they really don't have a clear of idea of what assets they really own.

Further, in these collateral chains they are rehypothecating collateral to make a quick buck. All is well, until this virus comes along. Suddenly, corporations are losing their collateral in these risky investments. Further, they need cash. The first thing they do is try to transform their collateral for short term liquidity. However, a bunch of people have just lost their money playing this game and don't want to play anymore, so it becomes more difficult and expensive for the companies to engage in these collateral transformations. The assets they have are worth less, so they have to sell other assets to compensate. However, everyone is doing this at the same time, devaluing the assets. Devaluation of assets makes it even more expensive to engage in collateral exchanges, and the cycle continues. Finally, when these companies take account of their actual assets, after all of these complicated exchanges, they realize they don't actually own what they think they own, creating additional panic when they are already in crisis mode. This causes huge turmoil, and the markets fall off a cliff.

If this theory is correct, what will we see next? Whether the markets will go up or down is dependent on too many factors to predict. However, I do have some speculation. First let's categorize corporations as follows:

**Type I: Safe**

Large banking institutions

Large P-1/A-1/F1+ Companies

Companies with huge cash reserves

**Type II: Possibly Safe**

Small businesses

""Essential"" business (i.e., Boeing)

**Type III: Doomed**

Business with >500 employees, no large cash reserves, not P-1/A-1/F1+

The self-employed

Type I businesses will certainly weather the storm. If they don't have the direct support of the Fed, they have large cash reserves on hand. If they don't have large cash reserves on hand, they have the credit rating to make use of corporate paper. They can find the short term funding needed to make it through this.

Type II businesses may be safe depending on the government response. I am currently underwhelmed by the ""support"" for small business in the stimulus bill, but there seems to at least be talk about this so maybe things will change. ""Essential"" businesses may receive a bailout to get them through tough times.

Type III businesses are completely screwed, no one seems to know they are even there. They won't qualify for support as ""small businesses"", and they have no way of obtaining liquid assets in this market. In particular, the larger businesses don't have the pristine assets to obtain liquidity in these markets, they are dependent on collateral transforms.

I won't predict whether the markets will go up or down this week, next, etc. But I will speculate this: I think the calm we saw in the markets was an actual calm. I think there was panic as businesses tried to obtain liquidity. They now believe they have the liquidity to make it through the near future, and are satisfied. There could be fire-sales in the near term for other reasons, but I don't think short-term liquidity will be the cause. However, most corporations don't speculate very hard when it comes to the future: they listen to the ""experts"". And these ""experts"" in government and the financials have been predicting doom and gloom for the next couple weeks, but that things will ""bounce back"" afterward. This is flatly false. As this becomes more apparent to these companies, I think we'll see another run on the market.

Particularly, it will be the large Type III business that will be the most vulnerable. They won't have any government stimulus support, and they won't have access to their normal modes of obtain cash. The last panic in the markets pushed bond yields so high that issuing new bonds will be completely out of the question. For them, it will be like a game of chess where your 4 moves away from being mated no matter what you do. Many of them will decide that bankruptcy is the best option in front of them.

Can the Fed prevent this? I don't think so. The Fed has the ability to soak up P-1/A-1/F1+, but they can only do this through the banks. But the banks aren't the ones in trouble this time, its the market itself. I have not read anything that leads me to believe that the Fed would be able to purchase junk assets from non- P-1/A-1/F1+ corporations without an act of Congress, and Congress is too slow and incompetent to see this problem coming or fix it in time. The Colosseum will be protected as Rome burns around it.

Listen up autists because you are about to get your ass saved by this knowledge I'm about to drop on you. Because today we're going to learn about hedging strategies. I've noticed that some of us may be confused on how to limit downside risk.

For those of you lazy bananas just waiting for the TLDR, well here it is: ~~3/27 270c; 3/27 200p~~; 3/27 230c, 3/27 210p \[Edit: better range\]. You're going to have to read to figure out why buying both is useful.

First, let's get clear on what a **hedge** refers to. According to Investopedia:

&#x200B;

>A hedge is an investment to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. Normally, a hedge consists of taking an offsetting position in a related security.  
>  
>In plain-speak, a hedge is placing the opposite or comparable bet to make sure your ass is saved if everything goes tits up.^(1)

&#x200B;

Believe it or not, but options are not just for playing the market like casino chips.

In fact, they can be used in combination with regular stock, or along with other assets, to reduce risk and maximize returns.

Options accomplish 2 primary things:

&#x200B;

* They allow us to control for downside risk,
   * similar to buying car insurance for your speed demon of a wife.
   * When you buy puts you are protecting yourself from losses if your long position goes tits up.

&#x200B;

* They allow us to leverage our existing assets for greater returns.
   * Similar to renting out your condo to buy more rental condos, you can ""rent out"" stocks that you own by selling *covered calls or puts*, a concept we will discuss further down.
   * This is where Theta gang get their tendies.

&#x200B;

**Shit happens quickly**, as we saw Friday. Unless you fart magic you're not going to predict when it will shift. Luckily, you don't need to with these simple tricks.

&#x200B;

**Trick #1: The Straddle**

It is not just what your wife does to the neighbor while you film. It is also what you can use when you don't know whether witches will appear as promised, or if stone cold warlocks will grab your balls and squeeze them for max pain.

&#x200B;

[A long straddle is a combination of buying a call and buying a put, both with the same strike price and expiration. Together, they produce a position that should profit if the stock makes a bigly move either up or down.\[2\]](https://preview.redd.it/xstf9d2fz9o41.png?width=376&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c6921819a3cdf95f0a44a76f34584f1c3359e69)

&#x200B;

As you can see, the the above scenario may come in handy for days like Monday where we are all basically 50/50 whether it will be upsies or downsies.

It is the Schrodinger's cat of options plays. Except, either of the two states will result is an alive portfolio.

Literally can't go tits up, [unless you suffer from IV crush](https://www.warriortrading.com/volatility-crush-definition-day-trading-terminology/), or it goes sideways..

Which leads us to:

&#x200B;

[A short straddle is an options strategy comprised of selling both a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. It is used when the trader believes the underlying asset will not move significantly higher or lower over the lives of the options contracts.](https://preview.redd.it/fc43n1glz9o41.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69cb9f69f0eaecde065ce46ad78e33a44288b63)

&#x200B;

Use the above scenario when the underlying asset is trading inside a defined range.

Be careful, because any escape up or down will mean certain doom.

You should be aware that selling a call and a put implies that you own shares of the underlying security, otherwise you will be on the hook to purchase if it goes the wrong direction.

When it comes to buying straddles you need a decent amount of cash to buy both a call and put for the same strike price.

Also, what if you are certain that the stonk will go up but still want some downside protection?

That leads us to:

&#x200B;

**Trick #2: The Strangle**

* A strangle is a more cost-effective way to hedge while still maintaining a position on a direction of a security.
* It involves purchasing an opposite position with a different strike price.
* The strike price can be OTM or NTM depending on how much you would like to control for downside risk.

More info:

>A strangle is an options strategy where the investor holds a position in both a [call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp) and a [put](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp) option with different [strike prices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp), but with the same expiration date and underlying asset. A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying security will experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction. However, it is profitable mainly if the asset does swing sharply in price.^(3)

Example:

Say Friday you decided to hedge on witches and bought an SPY 3/20 $280c like a retard.

Had you also purchased an SPY 3/20 210p you may have come out ahead, or at least retained your principal.

&#x200B;

*Long Strangle*

[The long strangle, also known as buy strangle or simply \\""strangle\\"", is a neutral strategy in options trading that involve the simultaneous buying of a slightly out-of-the-money put and a slightly out-of-the-money call of the same underlying stock and expiration date. Long Strangle Construction.](https://preview.redd.it/ftnv7cfsz9o41.png?width=376&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd31e9172d729ff696343db774128e31751a536)

Just as with straddles, strangles can go long or short. To retain a position on a security that you expect to trade sideways you can use the short strangle.

*Short Strangle*

&#x200B;

[The short strangle, also known as sell strangle, is a neutral strategy in options trading that involve the simultaneous selling of a slightly out-of-the-money put and a slightly out-of-the-money call of the same underlying stock and expiration date.](https://preview.redd.it/zig2ywmyz9o41.png?width=376&format=png&auto=webp&s=30154fc8dec56edaeb9d0d52456cf28d7036d837)

Maximum profit for the short strangle occurs when the underlying stock price on expiration date is trading between the strike prices of the options sold.

At this price, both options expire worthless and the options trader gets to keep the entire initial credit taken as profit.^(4)

&#x200B;

**Trick #3: Selling Call Options**

* You may hear a lot of people throw around Theta gang.
* They are referring to the type of options play where you sell a call option via 'sell to open' on a security that they own.
* If they do not own the security they are selling a 'naked call' which can be risky if the play goes the wrong way.

&#x200B;

[A covered call is an options strategy involving trades in both the underlying stock and an option contract. The trader buys \(or already owns\) the underlying stock. They will then sell call options for the same number \(or less\) of shares held and then wait for the option contract to be exercised or to expire.](https://preview.redd.it/aovk2pm8v9o41.jpg?width=296&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b1058572c74036ddf9d6dab52d957b60b48ac8e)

This is the most basic way to profit from your portfolio in a situation where the stock may not move up in price. That way you can keep your shitty JNUG shares and earn money while they slowly move down to $1. Just sell an OTM call, but make sure that you have at least 100 shares of JNUG for each contract sold otherwise you'll have a margin call if it goes up beyond your strike price.

&#x200B;

**Trick #4: Credit Spread**

* In finance, a credit spread, or net credit spread is an options strategy that involves a purchase of one option and a sale of another option in the same class and expiration but different strike prices.
* It is designed to make a profit when the spreads between the two options narrows.

&#x200B;

[The call credit spread is a bearish to neutral options trading strategy that capitalizes on theta decay and downward price moves in the underlying asset. It is comprised of a short call and a long call, and is sometimes also referred to as a “bear call spread.”](https://preview.redd.it/6g2tvw6ow9o41.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8734083c097757a6b3c8031cf8b4479bdff76912)

The call credit spread option strategy also works in minimally rising markets, as the trade will be entirely profitable if the underlying asset closes below short call strike price at option expiration.^(5)

Example:

&#x200B;

>Stock XYZ is trading at $50 a share.  
>  
>Sell 53 call for $0.50  
>  
>Buy 55 call for $0.20  
>  
>The net credit received for this trade is $0.30 ($30).  
>  
>The best case scenario for a call credit spread is for the underlying instrument, stock XYZ in this case, to move down or stay the same. If stock XYZ is anywhere below $53 at expiration (the price of the short strike), this trade would be a full winer.

Take care to review the below resources and watch some YouTube to fully understand these plays before partaking. It is important that you understand how to properly leverage and control for risk to avoid a massive GUH when you fuck up.

**Implied Volatility on SPY and Other Assets - Important Info**

One of the most practical applications of the above strategies is to ~~hedge against the~~ leverage the decline in VIX to control for IV decay. /u/bigd0g111 does an excellent job of explaining this in their post on [how to avoid IV Crush](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmshcv/when_market_bounce_inevitably_comesdont_scream/):

&#x200B;

>Hedge vega (the quantifiable proxy for IV on option pricing). Vega represents the change in an option value for a 1% change in IV.  
>  
>The hedge is by going long $SPY calls, and hedging the vega by shorting the $VIX with puts. All you need to do is match up the vega of the $SPY call with the delta of the $VIX put.  
>  
>**The Hypothetical Trade:**  
>  
>Long $SPY 4/17 240c - trading at 9.65 a piece with a **vega** of 0.2404  
>  
>Long $VIX 4/15 52.5p - trading at 7.90 a piece with a **delta** of -0.2463

&#x200B;

If you autists aren't taking the bare minimum protections to hedge against downside risk, especially for VIX then you have no-one to blame but yourself if you get pinched.

Take a read of the post(s) I mention above and be sure to ask any silly questions below if you get stuck. Remember, there are no silly questions, just silly people. Thanks and goodnight.

People are defying the curfew ordered by PM Nodi to get to their home villages (and because of the lack of testing, it could be spread even more). Also a major Hindu festival is about to start, and the government has only recently canceled plans for people to congregate at the sacred city of Ayodhya. However, people since this is such an important festival, people are still going to try to go (and may even bribe their way in).

Because of all of this, India is going to have a massive surge in confirmed cases and deaths soon, and all INDA puts will print.

First of all, let's put the obvious aside. All the fat Americans will be watching Netflix at home due to the quarantine. One more interesting thing to note here, is that cinemas are cancelled which means that [all these new theatrical releases will most likely be pushed to streaming platforms instead](https://www.engadget.com/2020/03/22/paramount-the-lovebirds-direct-to-netflix/), namely Netflix and Disney. The last nail in the coffin is that earnings report will be speculatively released on the [21st of April.](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nflx/earnings) What happens before an earnings report release, you ask me? Well, uncertainty goes up and IV goes up as well! Which means that the low IV contracts on late April will also go up in values.

TL:DR; TENDIES!

Edit: one more thing to note, is that you want to sell your contracts to FDers before the earnings report, so that you don't get double-penetrated by two BULLS.

Sup autists. Just throwing out some DD I put together so you nerds can view it free. TLDR: BHVN - Biohaven Pharma is a solid buy at this discount. PT of $50 by Q4 2020. Dunno about options, I'm not nearly autistic enough to buy options on speculative pharma companies. Post is missing some images my article has, too lazy to put them in on reddit. You can look shit up yourselves on their deck and website if you want to do more DD than all the shit I wrote for you.

Biohaven Pharmaceuticals (BHVN) has had quite the volatile 2020 fueled by both positive and negative announcements. I have been watching the company for the past year, but hadn't found an optimal time to enter. The recent market downturn has done just that, provided a great entry point for investors to really capitalize on the future of Biohaven. 

Recent Breakthroughs

**Verdiperstat**

The FDA recently granted Biohaven both [Orphan Drug designation](https://www.biohavenpharma.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/02-19-2019) and fast track status for Verdiperstat, a myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor, for the treatment of multiple system atrophy (MSA). The FDA has officially acknowledged the high unmet medical need for people suffering with MSA. The Fast Track designation may help accelerate the development of verdiperstat as the first treatment aimed at slowing progression of this devastating disease. Verdiperstat is a potential brain-penetrant, irreversible inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, an enzyme that acts as a key driver of pathological oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. A phase 3, multinational clinical trial is currently ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of verdiperstat in MSA patients. So far, in approximately 250 patients that have been dosed, the drug has been well tolerated and safe while demonstrating target engagement through lowering blood MPO activity. Reducing blood MPO activity in turn reduces neuralinflammation in patients (specifically with parkinsons). [In the Phase IIa trial](https://www.biohavenpharma.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/02-19-2019) of 12 weeks of treatment, placebo-treated patients worsened by 4.6 points (SE=1.1, n=17) on the Unified MSA Rating Scale, while verdiperstat-treated patients worsened by 3.7 points (SE= 1.2, n=17) at the 300mg twice-daily dose and by 2.6 points (SE=1.4, n=18) at the 600mg twice-daily dose. Roughly [0.6 out of 100,000 people (roughly 1900 cases per year)](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/multiple-system-atrophy/) are diagnosed with MSA annually making this disease a rare and low occurring disease that has no viable treatment options that target MSA directly. Licensed from AstraZeneca ([AZNCF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZNCF)), verdiperstat's current Phase IIa trial is set to last until Q4 2020 where the company will evaluate the 52-week data. 

**NURTEC ODT**

The largest and most recent news was the FDA approval of NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. The single oral dose of NURTEC ODT 75 mg can provide fast pain relief and return patients to normal function within one hour, and deliver sustained efficacy that lasts up to 48 hours for many patients. Uniquely, the pill disperses immediately in patients mouths without the need to swallow pills presenting convenient ingestion for many individuals that have difficulty with pills. CEO of Biohaven, Dr. Vlad Coric commented,

>""Millions of people suffering from migraine are often not satisfied with their current acute treatment, at times having to make significant tradeoffs because of troublesome side effects and reduced ability to function. NURTEC ODT is an important new oral acute treatment for migraine that offers patients the potential to quickly reduce and eliminate pain and get back to their lives."" 

NURTEC ODT functions through blocking CGRP receptors, treating a root cause of migraine. NURTEC ODT is not an opioid or narcotic, does not have addiction potential and is not scheduled as a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The drug is extremely well tolerated with nausea as the most common adverse effect that only 2% of patients experienced.

[The FDA approval of NURTEC ODT is based on results from the pivotal Phase III clinical trial and the long-term](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/212728s000lbl.pdf), open-label safety study. In the Phase III trial, NURTEC ODT achieved statistical significance on the regulatory co-primary endpoints of pain freedom and freedom from most bothersome symptom (MBS) at two hours post dose compared to placebo. NURTEC ODT also demonstrated statistical superiority at one hour for pain relief (reduction of moderate or severe pain to no pain or mild pain) and return to normal function. The benefits of pain freedom, pain relief, return to normal function and freedom from MBS were sustained up to 48 hours for many patients. Importantly, these benefits were seen with only a single dose of NURTEC ODT. Eighty-six percent of patients treated with NURTEC ODT did not require rescue medication (e.g. NSAIDS, acetaminophen) within 24 hours post dose. The long-term safety study assessed the safety and tolerability of rimegepant with multiple doses used over up to one year. The study evaluated 1,798 patients, who used rimegepant 75 mg as needed to treat migraine attacks, up to one dose per day. The study included 1,131 patients who were exposed to rimegepant for at least six months, and 863 who were exposed for at least one year, all of whom treated an average of at least two migraine attacks per month. 

As Biohaven's first FDA approved drug, the company has a pretty robust go to market strategy that involves a [""Surround Sound"" approach](https://www.biohavenpharma.com/sites/default/files/BIOHAVEN%20Investor%20Presentation%20Cowen%204March.pdf). They plan on targeting both Healthcare practitioner programs as well as peers through consistent engagement and education on the true benefits of NURTEC ODT. The company is embracing a social first mindset among the heavy scrutiny surrounding opioid and pharmaceutical markets. With this in mind, they are engaging in a 6 month implementation program to launch a payer program for CGRP migraine prevention class while engaging major insurance carriers such as Cigna, Anthem, Aetna and many more. Below lays out the true benefits of NURTEC ODT to the patient population.

Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan commented prior to approval that estimates for rimegepant scale to approximately $1 billion in sales by 2030, for its use in acute migraine treatment.

Recent Downfalls

Q4 missed earnings, reporting a GAAP EPS of -$2.85 compared to the projected -$1.93 consensus. The miss was attributed to several large factors I will lay out below but the big hit is hard to swallow despite having many favorable events on the horizon for the company.

The major factor contributing to decline in share price outside of the Corona Virus activity is the failure of troriluzole [Phase III clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03829241?lead=biohaven&phase=2&draw=2&rank=2) evaluating troriluzole as monotherapy in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) failed to sufficiently separate from placebo on the primary endpoint of total HAM-A score at week 8. The company will terminate development for monotherapy use in GAD. Several studies in other diseases and with different dosing approaches are in process. It hurst to see a study in Phase III be discontinued. That is years of hard work and money down the drain to start fresh. With NURTEC ODT being approved shortly after this announcement, we should see the events balance out with the NURTEC ODT news slightly outweighing the effects of troriluzole.  Additionally troriluzole will be continued through several other avenues. Earlier this year, troriluzole dosed at 280mg successfully advanced past an interim futility analysis in its pivotal Phase II/III trial in Alzheimer's disease study performed after 100 subjects completed 6 months of treatment. Completion of the troriluzole in Alzheimer's Disease trial is expected in 4Q 2020, and topline data is anticipated from the troriluzole adjunctive therapy obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) trial in 2Q 2020 and from the troriluzole in SCA trial in 2021. There is light at the end of the tunnel for the drug candidate with different indications. 

Finances

The company's recently reported earnings missed pretty significantly. Biohaven was hit with a massive registration fee exceeding $100 million as well as filing fees for NURTEC ODT NDA and commercialization preparation. As expenses pile up around the go to market with NURTEC ODT, we expect to see high expenses the first few quarters following the approval with leveling off as build out is finalized and revenues begin to be generated. The Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $528.8 million, or $10.91 per share, compared to $240.9 million, or $6.15 per share for the same period in 2018.

Raised Gross Proceeds of Approximately $287.5 million in secondary offering – In January 2020, Biohaven closed an underwritten public offering of 4,830,917 common shares at a price to the public of $51.75 per share and in February 2020, the underwriter exercised its option and purchased an additional 724,637 shares; gross proceeds from the offering were approximately $287.5 million, adding to cash as of December 31, 2019, of $316.7 million, excluding $1.0 million of restricted cash.

Conclusion

FDA approval, strong cash position and positive forward looking growth is going to drive Biohaven to new highs. The company will use its flagship product NURTEC ODT to gain market share in the acute migraine space while developing their late stage pipeline towards NDA filing and FDA approvals. With several Phase II/III clinical trials ongoing and data results projected towards the 2H 2020, Biohaven is at an optimal buying level. The stock currently sits under $30 a share, massively oversold from the failure of troriluzole Phase III study and recent Corona Virus market activity. While it is hard to call a bottom on any market, sub $30 is a rare price level for this stock. When you take into account the late stage pipeline and projected revenues from NURTEC ODT it is hard to pass up. The company has seen both FDA approval and trial failure leading to discontinuing a Phase III study in 2020 already. With such a busy 1Q, Biohaven is shaping up to have a bullish 2H 2020.

**Upcoming Milestones:**

Biohaven expects to reach significant pipeline milestones with its CGRP receptor antagonists, glutamate modulators and myeloperoxidase inhibitors in 2020.

The Company expects to:

* Report Phase 2/3 topline data for troriluzole in OCD in the second quarter of 2020.
* Report Phase 2/3 topline data from ongoing trial evaluating troriluzole in Alzheimer's disease around the end of 2020.
* Complete enrollment in Phase 3 trial of troriluzole in Spinocerebellar Ataxia in the second quarter of 2020.
* Continue enrolling patients in Phase 2 proof of concept trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of rimegepant in patients with treatment refractory trigeminal neuralgia.
* Continue enrolling patients in Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of MSA, a rare, rapidly progressive and fatal neuroinflammatory disease with no cure or effective treatments.
* Conduct ongoing non-clinical studies defined under the scientific research agreement with University of Connecticut to support the advancement of UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular metallothionein.",2020-03-22 22:03:10

Doesn't really matter either way. Just wanted to give some of my perspective on the recent PR involving Amazon. 

You've probably heard that Amazon is aiming to hire 100,000 new employees. As of this week my company has had more routes to drive, but every route is about 60% of a normal sized one. So the idea that there's more work/volume seems like a myth to me. They're just reducing everyone's work and spreading it out to more people. 

When Amazon does these mass hirings (like around Christmas), it's pretty much guaranteed they won't keep more than 20% of the new hires, and to offset the ones they keep, they'll let go of poor performers who have been there a while. My manager literally told me of the 7 people they just hired, they'll only keep 1-2 of them in the next 90 days. 

They're just taking advantage of this influx of desperate unemployed bastards hoping that 1 in 10 of em isn't a total fucking retard. 

Also worth knowing that it doesn't seem like Amazon gives a single fuck about spreading this virus to the whole damn country. There have been practically zero precautions set in place for drivers. We don't have to wear gloves, masks, anything. They're not screening drivers for illness, so I bet there are plenty of Amazon drivers infected throughout the US right now that are delivering this virus to 500-600 people weekly. Amazon is tiptoeing a giant fucking cliff and so far dominating the PR of the whole situation. But I see through it. 

I'm also typing this on the clock. With all the money you make with this info you'll probably be able to afford Amazon Prime, and some retard will deliver the tenders straight to your fucken door.

I only trade with support/resistance & VWAP while watching level 2 data. Some people like a lot of other studies, that's fine but I feel it's unnecessary. If you are just using a line graph or robinhood charts, you deserve to lose money. 

The SPY went sideways this week for an important reason. You clearly see the SPY tried to retest $255 6 times, then it tested $250 5 times. Why is $250-255 important? Bottom chart - The first bottom is Feb 2018, the next one is March-April 2018 which is around $250.  The SPY then bottomed in Dec 2018 at $235 (no screenshot, go look at a fucking graph).

If you guys would get an actual charting software you might not have gotten burnt at the witching hour. I loaded up on SPY 4/13 $200 puts, about 20mins before the close. Why? Because it failed to break out over that $235 resistance (Dec 2018 low). Now we are fully under major support levels, we we should go to the next support at $213, which is around Oct 2016 levels. I know everyone is mad that WSBs was wrong about the witcher, but it's still good to listen to people, form a hypothesis of what you think might happen, then let the graph tell you if it's correct or not in real time. 

My next move - Selling my puts Monday or Tuesday, if we get below $215. Watching for the stimulus bill to pass, as once that happens, I believe the SPY will try to retest $250 again, maybe even $270. You can try to get calls for this, but you gota be quick and be ready to exit. Once it hits $250, I'll be looking to load up on late April-may puts.

&#x200B;

This does not mean that these compounds will be effective in vivo, as there are many other factors at play when using a full biological system rather than isolated cells (in vitro study).  This simply means there is hope for a novel treatment, and has been for years now.  We know now that they are on the fast-track for approval of Remdesivir for the treatment of CoVID-19.  But what isn't talked about is the over 100 other analogs that are also patent-protected by Gilead. 

&#x200B;

This means, essentially, that Gilead will be the sole proprietor of CoVID-19 treatment if Remdesivir happens to be effective in vivo.

Last post:  [\[DD\] $SBUX is gonna sink!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmeyoi/dd_sbux_is_gonna_sink/)



Hello autists, on Saturday 3/21 I went out with my fellow retard and did some investigation on Starbucks in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We pretended to be the retards in the movie *The Big Short* who were investigating mortgage-unpaid houses. 

**1. We checked 22 Starbucks**, 16 of which are located along Yonge Street, basically the street with the most hobos in Toronto, i.e. the busiest street; the other 6 are just random picks in the areas that I am familiar. So this is not an accurate investigation. It is just two fellow retards pretending to be movie characters.

For locations' details please click [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ql0uzc7m91p515/Starbucks%20research.pdf?dl=0).

In summary, out of these 22 stores: 

* 11 out of 22 are Closed. The 11 closed ones are all in downtown area, near street and without drive-thru option. [For the same reason, many stores in the US major cities like Seattle would be closed.](https://i.imgur.com/J1danqf.jpg)
* Only 1 store has drive-through and it is in suburban town. Drive-through staff said: “busy. Same amount of drive-thru people. Very stressful.”
* 10 open maybe because they are essential to public service officers (police, fire department, hospital, etc.); still too many open but I do not know why. 1 claimed ""**1/8** of normal volume"", 1 claimed ""only 10 customers per hour compared to 800 when busiest""



**2. So let's do a very dumb calculation:** 

[70% of sales in the drive-thru enabled stores come from the drive-thru](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/as-starbucks-embraces-the-drive-thru-a-few-speed-traps-ahead)

[60% of Starbucks locations have drive-thru capabilities](https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-closing-locations-keeping-drive-thru-open-2020-3) 

If Starbucks keeps only drive-thru and some ""essential"" stores open, 

the drive-thru stores will generate 70%\*60% = 42% of regular volume, 

plus those ""essential"" stores, say 1/4 of the 40% non-drive-thru stores are open, which is 10% stores are open with only **1/8** of regular volume, equal to 1.25% of regular sales.

Then the current sales would be 42% + 1.25 % = 43.25% of regular ones.

But due to the new ""30 days salary for baristas even not showing up"" policy, [a drive-thru store would be closed if most workers don't want to come](https://i.imgur.com/4eneoeT.jpg). The drive-thru stores will generate less than 42%.



The calculation above is dumb as fuck, with small sample size, stupid simple adds and multiplies, ignoring the difference between Canada and other markets, excluding many factors like delivery orders, other product sales, bluh bluh bluh. It is just to show an idea that how big the difference is. The sales volume could drop lower than 40% of regulars. Yes just put it as I just made the number up.

With such a big drop in the revenue, while still having to pay salaries, you can see how big the drop would be in their earnings. **Probably it will end up losing money in fiscal year 2020.**

And yet, they would like to keep their [promise of 40m shares buyback](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/weve-got-a-strong-balance-sheet-starbucks-ceo-defends-buybacks.html).



The calculation didn’t consider the drop caused by people not buying coffee because staying at home or working from home.

**3. Some of you might want to talk about Chinese market, saying** [**they will reopen 95% of stores by end of March**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-starbucks-sbux-stock-dividend-233311299.html)**.**

But,

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218366/number-of-international-and-us-starbucks-stores/), Starbucks has 31,256 stores worldwide (in 2019).

USA:13,189

International: 15,041

Edit: I don’t know why 13189+15041 is less than 31256 but the website said so. I assume the principle of addition is broken.

Out of the internation 15,041 stores, Starbucks has 4,200 stores in China, according to [Starbucks in China](https://www.starbucks.com.cn/en/about/).

China's coffee market is growing rapidly but it is not a coffee-country. Drinking coffee is more of a show-off habbit among the white-collars in major cities. Most people don't drink coffee.

* [The average Chinese still only drinks five cups per year, says the International Coffee Organisation, a London-based group. That is just 1.3% of the amount consumed by the average Japanese or American.](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/05/23/china-is-a-nation-of-tea-drinkers-but-coffee-is-taking-off)
* And within the coffee they drink: [The market's largest segment is the segment Instant Coffee with a market volume of US$8,334m in 2020.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/30010000/117/coffee/china#market-revenue)

News said Starbucks is going to reopen 95% of their stores in China. 95%, sounds good, but will people keep buying Starbucks after this pandemic disaster? Considering both fear of next virus wave and the desire for them to save money for other essential needs, or simply they buy cheaper coffee or other beverages. Starbucks is not the only company selling coffee in China.

Starbucks coffee is expensive af to us already. They are more expensive in China and their people's incomes are much lower than the US people. This pandemic is going to hurt Starbucks in China badly.



**4.** Ok retards, I am **too sleepy** to throw in numbers and sources like the [big hit in Chinese market](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/05/starbucks-china-business-is-recovering-from-coronavirus-closures.html) and how their business gets hurt in Europe (I don't even want to look it up and paste sources). After all, it's all priced in.

And I know no shit about technical analysis and stock price analysis. I can't point out how much lower will $SBUX go, I simply expect it to be lower and lower. Just buy puts and make tendies, or lose your life savings on this and then blame me like blaming those quadruple witches. This is just a sloppy DD, don't expect me to write a scientific essay.



**Final words**: the biggest challenge in the investigation was that many Starbucks stores don't allow customers to use washroom anymore, so at one point I considered to use a coffee cup to do it. Please include this scene in the movie for me.

PCR aka Put-Call Ratio; this is defined from Investopia as ""an indicator ratio that provides information about relative trading volumes of an underlying security's put options to its call options. The put-call ratio has long been viewed as an indicator of investor sentiment in the markets, where a large proportion of puts to calls indicates bearish sentiment, and vice versa.""

The strategy behind PCR is when ""above 1 is considered to be an indicator of a selloff while a put-call ratio below 1 is an opportunity to buy. Some traders use the put-call ratio as a contrarian indicator, and buy when the ratio is above 1 and sell when the ratio is below that figure.""

Now look at this fucking chart below that I made from data obtained at yahoo finance.

Yes that is a PCR Ratio at about 15 on May 1st. The Red line is at a constant of 1. Here is another chart with volume and open interest (in %) overlay as well.

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=covid-19&term=remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=covid-19&term=remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=)

These trials focus on COVID-19 patients with different disease severity. The estimated end date for these trials is between April 27th - May 1st. The primary outcomes of each of these trials are slightly different, but they all focus on whether they will shorten the disease course. Nobody is fooled that this is a cure for COVID-19, this is an immunological modifier that has the potential to shorten the disease course or lessen the disease severity.

Time your p/c based on this information. Traditionally clinical trial results can wait months until they are publically announced. In this case, I expect them to be expedited through the FDA fairly quickly.

as a side note, the Chinese studies plan to recruit 300-450 patients in their two studies in Wuhan and Beijing all the way until the end of April, and they say they have no new cases... hard to believe.

TLDR: remdesivir trials end April 27th - May 1st. results of the trial will likely be public shortly after.",2020-03-22 08:00:13

I know everyone has missed the train on INO, GILD and other completely retarded beer virus stocks but there's a hidden gem that no one has mentioned yet that would actually have promise beyond one year from corona virus after affects, MDT. MDT is proof of how retarded the market is right now being at 52 week lows while it's products are more and more in demand. They are also working with tesla on their ventilators so musk can transfer MDT his retard strength.

While it's hard to fight the downward trend. MDT is completely undeserving of it's sell off. In case the possibility of a default is worrying in this climate below is why this won't happen for MDT.

92 Billion dollar marker cap

Only 24B in debt

11B in Cash

30B in annual revenue

Net yearly interest on debt: 844M

Now let's get into why this company is deserving of a good pumping.  Ventilators, you've heard about them consistently every fucking day from the white house, Did you know a single ventilator costs 50k? you heard that right. Now lets break down the numbers, MDT is the number one global supplier of these ventilators, the best expertise, and the best production. Recently they doubled up on production of these ventilators and this is likely just the beginning as they are currently moving to 24/7 production..  From here on out all my numbers are essentially estimates, I will give play devils advocate with my estimates and give what I consider the to be the lower range of possible good outcomes for the company.

The most recent model, the puritan bennet 980 ventilator currently retails for 54k. Trying to find profit margins on the device is nightmare but we can do some extrapolation based on previous models. The puritan bennet 840 retailed around 10k and obviously a profit is made so the cost has to be less, but looking at the improvements made, I can't see the newer model objectively being worth more than double, coming with only a bigger screen, a battery, and a fail safe system. So that leads me to conclude it costs 20k or less to produce with 20k being an extreme estimate. So with a price of 50k the gross profit margins is, at the low end, 60%. 

Okay so that's some good info right off the bat, lets delve even deeper. Current estimates for worldwide ventilator demand is extreme with some US estimates being upwards of us being short on 800,000, with other countries falling in line as well. Seeing as how this seems to be a wake up call for governments about preparedness, I expect demand to continue after the virus as well so in terms of long term outlook, it shouldn't be a stretch to say the growth of this sector continues. If MDT is only producing 200,000 worldwide this year (a low ball considering Tesla is saying they can start with 1k a week (52k a year) starting in a week from a company with no in place infrastructure or experience, So 4x that amount is definitely not a stretch) would add nearly 6B to yearly gross profit a 30% increase. 

Reasons why this is a lowball:

Likely less than 20k to manufacture

governments pay much higher than market value (ie spending $50 per hammer)

assuming only 4x Tesla production, a company with no in place infrastructure or knowledge of the field.

So why MDT and not other companies in the field? Value proposition. I'm just going to paste a spreadsheet below with info on other companies in the field and you tell me what looks like the best buy, only JNJ looks anything close to the same value proposition.

 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mApsQKE6eeaTaR6aKNHFslFQ\_VSlGe5RgIcgKpoPyX8/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mApsQKE6eeaTaR6aKNHFslFQ_VSlGe5RgIcgKpoPyX8/edit#gid=0) 

Now on to entry/exit points and that good good TA. In this environment I feel daily charts are less insightful than 4 hour charts as the initial drop is essentially an outlier and fucks with a lot of TA that uses averages. On the chart below I'm using the ichimoku cloud and volume confirmations to decide my entrance. 

[https://imgur.com/UyBTVNF](https://imgur.com/UyBTVNF)

My entry point will be when the tenken crosses the kijun and the price breaks above both with large volume and closes above on two 4 hour candles or if the first break is just too convincing. If that sounds like gibberish it is, you wouldn't have a bad entry now if you believe in the DD, in fact it would be better I'd just prefer to trade off confirmations for the confidence in this market. My exit point is 500% profit no more no less. Keep in mind this is a play against the current momentum and the company is currently sitting at 2017 lows which relative to the market is still high. My numbers are all estimates which is why I tried to low ball how much profit they'll have but I could still be wrong on everything. Which is why I'm using TA for confirmation. if you want to know if I'm in the play yet just reply to this thread and ask again (please do, even though I've been researching a few hours I'll probably forget anyway).

Investment firms are projecting Unemployment peaking anywhere between 5.6% and 10%.   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said 20%. Bullard said 30%.

Estimates for returns to ""normal"", positive GDP growth range from Q3 this year to Q4 2021.

Corporations are withdrawing their forecasts, because they have no idea. Most of them don't have infectious disease experts or epidemiologists on staff. None of them have experience with an event like this.

Valuation metrics like the Buffet indicator or Trailing P/E for the S&P 500 are near historical averages.

Where we are at right now, about 35% down from the all time high, splits the difference between the the most optimistic and most pessimistic projections. It's where we should be until we get real data. If the Q1 data turns out worse than expected, than those Q2 & Q3 estimates will be pushed down, and drive the market down. Vice Versa if they're better than expected.

All you need to know is DHT has 25 oil tankers, bigly ones (Very Large Crude Carriers, VLCC) that can store 2M barrels of oil a ship. Corona killed the demand for oil but the Saudi's and Russians are increasing the supply. Where all that oil gonna go? Some in onshore storage until that shit spills over. Then it's going in the tankers boys!! Why? Cause those fucking traders with access to free capital and infinite leverage are going to buy spot crude and sell it forward on the futures market immediately locking in a huge profit cause the oil curve is in Contango.  For example, spread between spot Brent crude and 3 month futures is about $3.6 as I type this brain fart.  All those mouth breathing Goldman and Vitol traders have to do is find some ships to store that crude for 3 months and do the trade over and over cause Contango is the way with the Corona killing demand and the Saudi's and Russians pissing on each other.  Reality is DHT probably won't park ships with oil cause their ships are actually good ones, but all of the other ships storing oil get taken out of the market driving up rates even higher for DHT to deliver crude from Saudi to wherever the hell.

Now for some math. Skip to positions if you are retarded.  Eh, I'm retarded too, do your own math autists.

PS: If you want to follow day rates for these tankers go get the Tankers International App. Don't ask me how to interpret the data cause the shit is complicated.

&#x200B;

First off, the wuflu is fucking us. Not just us as in the US but us as in the world. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnm2yr/gentlemen_its_been_a_pleasure_serving_with_you/) explains why we are fucked. It sucks but its true. The virus is spreading in the US faster than it did in Italy (due to our much larger population) and Italy’s cases and deaths continue to rise by the day with no signs of slowing. If this is a sign for how its gonna go in the rest of the world (which it is) then buckle in cause we are going down. The overwhelming consensus is that no one has ever seen anything like this before and we have no idea what will happen, only that the bottom is not here yet. Now you have two choices to make.

&#x200B;

1. Roll over like a coward and just let Winnie The Poo and his Covid19 dick mushroom stamp us all, or;
2. Suck Winnie's dick like a man, buy puts in the countries that are in the process of pulling their panties down for wuflu and profit off of circumstances that we have no control over. I know which one I'm choosing.

&#x200B;

This leads to some DD (That I have only compiled, not wrote) which explains some decent options we have here. First, buy puts in Mexico (EWW), Germany (EWG), France (EWQ), India (INDA), and Australia (EWA). Now I didn't get info on all these countries but there are other posts here you can use or just type it into Google. I did, however, get posts describing how fucked [India](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn93kr/india_getting_worse_rapidly_inda_20p_424_inda_19p/) and [Mexico](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmk7lh/mexico_dd_short_eww/) are.

&#x200B;

Now that we have daddy corona out of the way, we can focus on individual companies. First off, the mother of all cuck traps... Disney (DIS). Get it through your heads that the mouse can not be beaten. They have such a diversified business model that just because the parks close doesn't mean they are fucked. Mickey has a bigger cock than all of us and will gladly swing it around. It is nigh impossible to profit off the rat. But be wary, if a profit is gained you get out and you stay away from it for the rest of your life because that massive, dirty rat will bite your dick off the next time you try anything.

&#x200B;

Next, Starbucks (SBUX). One of our own resident autists has embarked on an [Autist Investigation™](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmzsq6/dd_i_did_a_the_big_shortstyle_research_on_sbux/) with the goal of Big Shorting one of the many heads of BECKY. Read the post for more info, but it seems that overpriced coffee is not necessarily a necessity in the midst of a pandemic. Believe what you must but at this point, it seems that puts are a good idea right now.

&#x200B;

Now to Harley Davidson (HOG). I honestly don't even want to waste my finger strength typing this out as I have to use them on myself later so read this about how [Harley is fuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmh129/harley_davidson_hog_is_going_to_0/).

&#x200B;

[Next a PSA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fms8nt/oil_and_gas_indexes_being_liquidated/).  OILU and OILD are being delisted by the end of March so I hope you fucks don't have them.

&#x200B;

There was a post about how corporate bonds are gonna default and I have no idea what that means but it seems that we can make some money off of it so check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmr3dp/corporate_bond_defaults_are_coming/) regarding that.  Corporate bond defaults are gonna fuck some companies in the ass so buy puts on these corporate bond ETF’s; HYG, LQD, JNK.

&#x200B;

Finally, I have a little knowledge for you and will try and include this in every DD summary I do so here it is. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fn5f4p/hedging_for_autists/) explains hedge (for all you retards like me hedge=reduce risk) to save yourself from yourself. Skim what you can because you aren't gonna read all of it but at least say you tried.

As we are all watching the markets this morning and looking at announcement the FEDs are making week after week, we all have the same questions in our heads, ""what strike price and what date"". I'm afraid this question never ends with you making money.

&#x200B;

The whole world right now is currently focused at how to make money in the stock markets, half of it divided in the ""this isn't really bad"", and the other half thinking this is going to be a bigger recession than 2008. What if it actually is though, what if instead of a recession we are talking a depression? Here is what you can expect.

&#x200B;

The first real signature of the depression was large economic slow down and massive loss of jobs. People were going jobless across a lot of countries due to the inability of the economy to sustain those jobs as people did not have money to spend on goods.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8z382rs48fo41.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b58acde7f5e28518b457a3a6d5ee8af376d4570

*As the fed is currently feeding billions and trillions into the companies, in order to keep them afloat, in the from of loans at low/no or negative interest rates, the question is always the same:* ***Who will pay for these loans?*** 

And that is the main problem, as people lose jobs and loans are being printed out, we are not addressing how the loans will be repaid. The strength of the US economy was always that there was a lot of room to increase taxation, thus it was not a problem for the government to be piling debt more than you slam Budweiser on your Friday afternoon. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6h9ul2hz9fo41.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadcb0aaca5e41f6b47ee53b87c442c23dd49bf8

Now as the economy is coming to an halt and all the companies are levied to their tits, the Fed plan on increasing that debt and loan more money to anyone who requests it, they will buyback stocks, ETFs eventually and whatever they can to maintain stock prices somewhat sustainable.

&#x200B;

The Fed only has one lens, and that lens is the stock market, they are losing focus on the macro-economy aspect of it and how this will actually impact the USA position within the market.

&#x200B;

The only good news for the USA right now is that the world currently relies on the USD, so I guess it isn't just the USA's problem, but everyone's problem. The V shaped economy Trump was talking about is more and more looking like a slash shaped economy \\.

I don't come to you with an answer but I will tell you this. Be very careful out there, do your best to help other people around you, and keep trying to make tendies you autistic fucks. Pay alot of attention to market movements, people will be divesting from US indexes.

DD,Surviving coronavirus with JD. Doing the research so you don't have to,60,fne6fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fne6fx/surviving_coronavirus_with_jd_doing_the_research/,43,1584967786.0,"Alright, gather up for some casual DD from someone who has been following JD.com very closely for years. 

JD.com is a quiet behemoth of the Chinese e-commerce. At #2 in China, it owns and operates the most sophisticated delivery network in China (JD Logistics), which alone is worth around $8-10 billion. With revenues hitting almost $83 billion last year, they have powerful backing from Walmart and Tencent, which together own \~25% of Jd.com. Even [Google invested $550 million in JD.com \~1.5 years ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hendriklaubscher/2018/06/18/google-invests-550m-in-jd-com-what-are-the-long-term-implications/#3692b6943b66), and they are likely to expand the partnership to assist Google in expanding in SEA, while Google helps JD.com expand in the US.

During coronavirus, JD.com was the only company delivering to parts of the Hubei province most affected. They linked up agricultural sellers and grocers to hospitals and retail consumers, and were critical to keeping the food and basic essentials coming. As a result, they [earned a lot of goodwill during the Covid outbreak](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4324626-alibaba-bares-heart-jd-logistics-enjoys-enormous-goodwill) both in Hubei province and elsewhere in China, as Chinese government frequently tried to show what a great job they were doing to their local population, by highlighting what JD was doing (# of deliveries, 20,000+ people they hired, the safety equipment they donated, drones they used, etc.). JD.com was able to continue deliveries throughout the crises, in the worst areas, same/next day, unlike the struggles Amazon, which is struggling right now in the US (and this isn’t even the worst of it).

China has mostly recovered from COVID-19, so Chinese ADRs are likely the only stocks you can expect to increase revenue/earnings in the near future, at least for the next few months (barring a miracle drug discovery next week).

JD has been undervalued due to a number of issues (fake CEO scandal, China trade war), while they continued to deliver \~35% annualized revenue growth.

\*\*Quick stats:\*\* Last year, JD had net income of $1.5 billion on revenues of $82.9 billion. To put that in perspective, Alibaba had net income of $13B on revenues of $56B, and Amazon had $11.5B net income on revenues of $280B. JD.com is still ramping up, but would you guess that their market cap is only $55 billion, compared to $486 billion for Alibaba, and $919 billion for Amazon (which recently even crossed $1 trillion)?

They are likely to continue on their upwards trajectory, and given how they have become comfortably profitable over the last few years, expect the stock price to catch up to net income/revenue reality in the next year or two. 

&#x200B;

**Things going for JD:**

\- Generated $2.8 billion in FCF in 2019, and announced [$2 billion buyback program](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-com-buyback/chinas-jdcom-to-buy-back-2-billion-shares-idUSKBN2141UF) recently 

\- Looking to do a [secondary listing on the Hong Kong exchange](https://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/3075343/jdcom-said-have-approached-ubs-bank-america-arrange-hong-kong), following Alibaba's. They'll likely raise a few $billion

\- Forecasted expecting ""at least 10% YoY growth"" in Q1 2020. How many companies in the world are saying ""at least double digit growth in Q1"" during the coronavirus crisis? Granted, this was 3 weeks ago, but this was announced after the Chinese coronavirus peak. They have a history of meeting or exceeding guidance (beat EPS and revenue estimates past 5 quarters in a row)

\- They are considering an [IPO for their logistics subsidiary, at a \~$10 billion valuation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-23/jd-logistics-eyes-ipo-to-raise-up-to-10-billion-reuters-says)

\- They have consistently focused on integrity and combating fake/counterfeit products, and have [stayed off of US Treasury Dept’s “notorious marketplaces” list, unlike Alibaba](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2018_Notorious_Markets_List.pdf)

\- Gained 2-3 spots in Alexa global web rankings (from #14/13 to #11) in the past 90 days

\- They didn't include active monthly users from majority of the COVID-19 period in their Q4'19 update, so they'll show a dramatic YoY growth in users in Q1'20 earnings

\- Not only do they have minimal exposure to the world's consumers outside of China, but China is now recovering from coronavirus (or so they've wanted us to believe), so further coronavirus-related impact to financials will be limited (especially compared to the rest of the world)

\- They hold investments that alone almost add up to their market cap (e.g, VIPS, Farfetch, Gojek, JD Finance - spun off but JD receives 40 percent of pre-tax profit and has the option to convert that back to a 40 percent equity stake, JD Logistics - potential IPO soon)

\- They were able to [pilot their autonomous delivery vehicles and drone well ahead of schedule during the crisis](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/JD.com-makes-drone-deliveries-as-coronavirus-cuts-off-usual-modes). Should give them a leg up in that space because of proven capabilities despite probably not having the best technology in that space.  

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer:**

Of course, the [fear meter is off the charts](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/), so the stock market may keep dropping and drag JD along in the short/medium-term. However, looking at daily performance, you'll notice that JD has been comfortably outperforming S&P 500 over the past month.

This is a longer-term, high growth play (200-300% in 1-2 years, with right positions), with a potential for a shorter term high profits. Can save you cash from the current market panic, while setting you up for some sweet gains down the road.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

\- April 17 2020 $45 Calls (Very Risky)

\- June 19 2020 $45 Calls (Risky) 

\- September 18 2020 $50 Calls (Moderately Risky)

\- Jan 15 2021 $50 Calls (Fairly Safe)

\- Jan 21 2022 $55 Calls (Safe)

\- Stock on max margin (Safe, but not sure what you’re doing on WSB)

&#x200B;

**Bonus:** current positions and YTD gain on JD.com. So close to $69,420...

DD,DD: SPY End of Month Rally - Follow up Post,147,fojezf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fojezf/dd_spy_end_of_month_rally_follow_up_post/,119,1585136058.0,"Well against my better judgement I thought I would float this idea past you retards again.

[Previous Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm0cys/dd_spy_end_of_month_rally/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This past weekend I mentioned the idea of large flows of Pension money, and was basically booed me off the internet. Now after a 10% green dildo some of you guys see the fuckery the Fed and fellow idiots are capable of, and I'm pretty sure half of you switch back to being gay bulls.

Anyways, ZeroHedge just posted another article confirming the same idea - complete with lot of pretty crayon graphs for those who don't like words.

From ZeroHedge:

[$850 Billion In Stock Buying Is About To Be Unleashed](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/850-billion-stock-buying-about-be-unleashed)

Personally tomorrow I'll probably be closing out the Puts I bought EOD today, and roll to calls.

***EDIT***:  Also consider this narrative plays well into the rally potential that [Variation-Separate](https://www.reddit.com/user/Variation-Separate/) identified in this [excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fmhz1p/the_great_unwinding_why_wsb_will_keep_losing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) 3 days ago.

To be clear, I'm not trying to say that this is gonna be some face ripping rally, blowing away any previous record. I'm just thinking we could see a concerted move to the upside from the big money managers.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Moving to calls through the end of the month, cause Pensions and Quants have more money than I do.  THEN BACK TO PUTS.

&#x200B;

SPY   250/255/260C  3/31 thru 4/3

or if your account balance is small like your penis,

EWZ 25C 3/27   or   EWZ 24C 4/17  (Do whatever you like, just make sure it has the volume to support)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Updates:*

3/25

11:00a - Choppy early morning trading gave me a couple head fakes, but it looks as though after flirting with it a few times, this pop above S&P 2453 might be the move. Let's hope it sticks. Bought SPY 264 4/3  @  $3.41.

1:45p - Closed out my SPY 264C @ $7.45. Happy with 118% gains for \~3hrs.  Looks like I am leaving some on the table, but that is ok too. Bulls make money, bears make money, **pigs get slaughtered.**  *(EOD UPDATE: High for the day on that strike was $7.58, so I guess my move was about as lucky as I'm able to get. Happens every once in a great while.)*

3:50p - Took a small position of SPY 200P 4/3.  As everyone else is, I will be awaiting job numbers tomorrow to see how this plays out. As noted in u/Variation-Separate 's post (link in post above) it looks like we tagged the upper resistance line - I personally didn't think we would get here so quickly, but based on the aggressive timeline of the market moves lately, I guess it makes sense.

Will update again tomorrow post job number release / stimulus package with further positions. Looks like I should have picked up some more SPY Puts than I did earlier today. Oh well.

3/26

9:10a - Well, as I somewhat expected the Unemployment report failed to scare the shit out of the market, futures make a concerted move to green. Looks like I'll roll out of my small insurance put  position and roll into SPY calls.  It remains to be seen how much money the big boys have left to roll into equities from my initial thesis. Position size will be limited as I'm unwilling to bet the farm in this trading environment - feels like plenty of downside potential from here. Good luck - stay nimble.

9:40a - Sold puts at a loss, which was expected based on futures. Insurance isn't free. Watching for move.

9:55a - In SPY 265C 4/3. Buy @ $5.06 (Had to chase it a bit unfortunately). Let's get weird.

10:05a - IF (big if) we break yesterdays highs @ 2560, goal will be 2650 range. If we make it past 2560 I'll jump out on the run up to 2650.

10:49a - Out @ $5.46. Squeaked out a measly 7.9%. Definitely left money on the table - ouch. Looks like we broke back through that 2560 level so that was the extent of my personal comfort level. Probably start eyeing SPY Puts as we approach EOW. If I do jump into Puts I'll stop updating this thread, as it will have served its purpose for the rally I was trying to catch.

I hope everyone made some money this week!

11:30a - Ouch. My paperhands fucked me again. Lots of money left on the table. I guess the plus side is that if this moves anything like the market did yesterday it should take us to our target area quickly, ushering more downside. Eyeing Puts.

3/27

9:45a - Well yesterday afternoon I was feeling like the weekly rally was a bit overblown, so I took the opportunity to clean out all the nooks and crannies of our various retirement accounts. Swept literally every dollar to money markets for now. Also took a 30% position (of trading account) into SPY 210P 4/17's.  

Tempted to take a larger position in anticipation of a selloff into the weekend, however I'm not completely convinced that we've seen the absolute end of this bull rally. I will probably hold these SPY Puts over the weekend, and look to potentially add to the pile pending market activity around noon today. Regardless, I don't think I'll be buying any calls as I think most of the trade this post identified has occurred. Good luck out there.",2020-03-25 07:34:18

As of their most recent 10-K, their balance sheet was as follows:

Assets:

*$116M cash

*$230M non-cash current assets

*$600M long-term tangible assets, a little more than half of which is operating lease right-of-use

*$1.1B intangible assets, much of which is goodwill

Liabilities:

*$160M gift card liability

*$24M deferred employee compensation and benefits

*$174M other current liabilities

*$1.3B long-term debt

*$360M operating lease liabilities

*$240M other non-current liabilities

Even if we add back in the gift cards and employee compensation, they have a book value of essentially zero. They also filed an 8-K last week stating that they drew down $220M from their revolving credit facility ""although the Company has no need for additional liquidity"" (lol, sure), which means they have more cash but an offsetting amount of debt.

Based on their 10-K for FY2019, 98% of their revenue came from within the US, and ""At December 31, 2019, there were no long-lived assets located outside of the United States."" If giant sections of the US are locked down for much of Q1 and Q2, their revenue will be close to zero. And in that case it's not clear how these poor motherfuckers are gonna pay their rent, much less their $1.3B in long-term debt.

They're down like 75% over the past month, because everyone knows they're pretty fucked. But that's after they were up 33% today, because some morons think Trump is gonna bail out IHOP shareholders, even though he clearly prefers McDonald's breakfast. I say no, this company is on a Virgin Galactic ship to Chapter 11. Even after the economy reopens, who the fuck is gonna choose to celebrate by going to Applebee's?

DD,MTCH 7/17 90-110c,16,fohxo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fohxo4/mtch_717_90110c/,19,1585129848.0,"Alright alright the other autists are getting the word on [MTCH](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mtch/earnings) (Tinder & co) but I was on this bitch way ahead of you, first let's look at the prior art:

* a full-on retard posted last week [about buying puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fm8dcv/puts_on_mtch/) \-- godspeed to him
* a basic autist [posted about calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fofnzc/buy_mtch_60c_417/) earlier this evening, he is right, but that's only a tease, kind of like my wife getting dick pics from her boyfriend; she puts on a stupid smile but isn't gonna stop bitching about random shit until his car is in the driveway

Let's dive into the details. Last week [Tinder downloads went up 13%](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3554771-tinder-sees-u-s-downloads-grow-in-past-week-report). That's right, some dating apps are up (a bit), some other apps not really, because during a Pandemic you can't really go out and meet up people. If you're smart you go on PornHub to get it over with and go back to making tendies. And if you waste space, you go online and send messages to randos that you can't conceivably meet up for at least a month or two, so that you can as well waste time together.

What happens next? Well we're only at the beginning and haven't reached the peak yet which is expected in 1-2 weeks for NYC and probably 1-2 more week for other areas. We can't stay in lockdown for six months, but we can't either go back to work in two weeks like Trumpo saw us doing in his dream last night, because hospitals will be battlefields and if you have an accident on your way to getting the virus in the office, 911 will tow your car to clear the road and leave you on the sidewalk.

In reality what's gonna happen is that we'll stay home at least 2-6 more weeks, and when the beer virus growth is under control, businesses will gradually come back to life at a pace that allows dealing with new infections and regular care. This gradual re-opening will take another 3-6 months depending on therapy advances, better tracking etc. and bars and clubs will probably be amongst the last businesses allowed to re-open.

What does it mean for MTCH? Put it simply, it's a watershed moment for online dating -- well, MTCH, since they own 80% of the market--, but the real growth isn't gonna be until Q2. Here is what's gonna happen:

Q1:

* people inevitably get horny in quarantine, after the [awkward roommate sex](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-sex-guidance.pdf) many people that never used online dating will install the app, set up their account and send bottles in the sea -- probably not pay for premium though, knowing that they won't go out on dates
* as we've already heard here and other places, the quarantines will be a boon for divorce lawyers, each break up is two new users

Q2:

When people are gradually able to go out, they will need to unload their stress and celebrate by sleeping with strangers, and online dating is perfect because:

1. bar & clubs will still be closed, and;
2. you and your partner can exchange your covid status before you decide to meet up, hence avoiding getting the beer flu when you're only ready for herpes

This is such an obvious thing that I wouldn't even be surprised to see the gov supporting this usage in a few months to avoid super-spreader events in the upcoming waves.

Timing: Match Group is expected to report their 2020 Q1 earning on or around 05/07, but are also obviously sharing numbers outside earning calls. I expect we will have a glimpse of Q2 usage by July.

Price: Match was already set to outperform this year, and lost -28.84% stock value in the past 3 months, while the S&P lost -24.70% over the same period. MTCH is the golden nugget while retards are still chasing quick returns on 1k+ P/E shops like ZM and TDOC.

Before Corona Became Known:

1. China devised COVID-19 in a lab and knew it would create chaos as there was no vaccine for it.
2. In the mean time they were creating the virus, Chinese officials were also drafting plans on how they were going to create makeshift hospitals, get all the masks & respirators that would be needed, and produce the thousands of test kits that would also be needed.
3. Once the government was prepared, the virus ""accidentally"" escaped a lab somewhere in Wuhan and World War III officially began.

Shot Heard Round the World:

1. After the first patient reported was found ill on December 1st, hundreds more cases of Chinese being ill followed. On January 10th, the first death was reported. On January 23rd, the Hubei province was put on lockdown. 
2. Yet, the Chinese were extremely well prepared. A couple of days after Hubei was put on lockdown, 12000 bed hospitals were being built and they were completed in less than 2 weeks. China had all the respirators, gas masks, and other necessary equipment for 2 reasons: 1) the government prepared its stockpiles before they released the virus, and 2) the Chinese are the major producers of such equipment so they can continue to churn out more of it when they are in short supply.
3. A couple days ago (March 22-23), the Chinese were seen in videos celebrating and even announced they had a potential vaccine. How could they have done it so quickly? Dr. Tony Fauci said it would take *at least 12 to 18 months* for the US to develop a vaccine.

My Theory

1. After the virus arrived to the US and it started to get more media attention, stocks have collapsed massively relative to their all-time highs in February. Right now, the US is financially defeated and on the verge of falling into what some people think is the Great Recession.
2. This plot is exactly what the Chinese hoped for. The Chinese have probably bought millions of shares of US companies in hopes of controlling them since they are very cheap at the moment. Further, China is now the largest foreign holder of US Treasury Securities, passing Japan a couple of days ago.
3. After this virus dies out eventually, the US companies that are controlled by the Chinese will have their capital pass into the hands of China.
4. China will be able to take over the US this way because it knows it cannot defeat the US militarily as the US is currently the most powerful country. 

Further Thoughts

1. At the peak of the virus epidemic, China's President Xi Jinping wore a face mask to visit Wuhan, the deadliest of the cities hit by covid-19. As a president, he should have been covered from head to toe. However, he knew the virus couldn't harm him because the Chinese have most likely found a cure to the virus, long before it was even released. 
2. Now, China is buying up stocks from countries on the brink of economic collapse because its goal is to control the entire world. Once they are done buying up, the Chinese will publicly announce they have a cure and the world economy will start back up again, with China being the majority shareholder of all stocks. 

TLDR: China released COVID-19 and knew the entire time the devastation it would have on the world economy. Before its release, the Chinese government was fully prepared and most likely had a vaccine ready as well. Now, as the US economy begins to collapse, the Chinese are buying up shares of major US companies at discounted prices. Right after the US economy collapses, China will announce it has a vaccine and the world economy will rebound, with China controlling the majority of US companies.",2020-03-25 04:09:55

Direction: **Neutral Bullish**

**Price Target:** **50$**

**Type: Short Put**

**Fundamental:** Nothing in Square’s formula has changed since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak. **There is a note that due to the closure of many SMBs, Square’s transaction count will be significantly affected.** Square’s price fell from about 85$ to about 49$ in the span of the first Coronavirus slide, bottoming out at 32$, which was quickly brought up to about the 40$ average. Since then, it has grown alongside the rest of the market. Square will face very little growth for the foreseeable future, but can be a great candidate for covered calls.

**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50, 200 day moving average. MACD slight shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 40, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are bullish in volume and Bearish open interest. Implied movement is a whopping 12.1% or about 5.85$ Short interest is at 7.83%, with 5.2 days to cover. Support at \~41$, with 52w high being 87.25$.

**Sentimental**: Square is a company that will not die. While the valuation was rich, Square was primely in the growth category, with its consistent revenue and EPS increases. The current coronavirus selloff has affected every stock on the market and Square was no exception. In addition, the recent purchase of Honey, alongside essentially halted SMBs, leaves SQ exposed to large risks. Analyst revisions have been entirely negative, as the outlook looks very grim. 

Typically in an elevated IV environment, sell-side earnings play becomes less effective. In addition, because of the current volatile macro environment, the binary event’s sway over price points becomes mitigated as well, making earnings movement even less predictable. **I believe the bottom line here is if SQ moves against you, it can be beneficial long term to absorb the shares and sell covered calls as a way to generate cash-flow**. While this leaves many smaller trades on the sidelines, extraordinary times and risk management dictates safer plays.

The amount of fucking posts ""SPY is down why are my puts down and tendies missing?"" has gotten out of control. That being said options are incredible complex instruments and probably shouldn't be so easily accessible to a bunch of teenagers like ourselves. 

Second, from the news/financial media down to people on this sub, everyone is fucking retarded. Idc if you're a HF manager or epidemiologist, no one has any fucking clue what's gonna happen. This is an unprecedented situation and the current extent of a highly interconnected and globalized economy will exacerbate it. For example, I work in insurance for small businesses ($50k-$25mm annual rev). My clients biggest concern isn't short term cash-- they can cut employees loose, negotiate rent, etc. What they're freaking out about is how businesses will react when this is all over. Will that warehouse still want to go forward with my client redoing their floors in June as expected? Will the 10 custom builders still be in business that give my client in supply distribution 90% of his revenue? It's the cyclical shit like that, if it lingers longer than expected, which is the biggest concern. 

**How we get tendies**: I think we see a dead cat soon and bounce back to 2750-3000. Almost every corner of the market is oversold technically speaking. This shit is obviously of major concern for the markets moving forward but we've gone down too far, too fast. IV is still too high to just buy puts ands the huge intraday swings can fuck  you if you're short.

So let's use a diagonal calendar spread. We **buy June 200 puts** and **sell April 190 puts**. We're then delta negative, theta positive and vega is somewhat offset from the short leg. **Worst case**, short leg expires worthless and we can either roll the short or exit for a marginal loss. If SPX stays in its range we stay about the same with a minimal P/L at April. **Best case**, we shit the bed further, if we blow past both strikes we're still looking at a decent profit.  

Calendars give you the flexibility of time. I don't wanna time the market rn and get fucked bagholding expensive puts, but I don't feel comfortable with no downside exposure. This could be done more effectively with long ATM put and short OTM but I don't wanna commit that much BP.

My last post still stands and holds some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

DISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

We are gonna start this one out with some news I guess. Waffle House has closed 365 locations. If fucking waffle house closes then you know we are absolutely going to get plowed by The Wuflu. Make sure to wear your old panties cause Winnie the Dictator is not gonna wait for you to slide them off, he's gonna rip them from your ass.[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fokd6w/waffle_house_closes_365_locations_drill_team_6/) gives some more details about the whole situation. Waffle House says that things are not getting better then that tells us to re-examine whatever the hell is going on out there.

As a matter of fact, I have a lot of shit that points to the fact that America is fuk. Our[ Autist Investigator™](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo9cks/did_a_little_dd_on_new_york/) of the day is saying we as a people are dumb, stupid, idiots that only care about ourselves (which is true) and that this is only the beginning. You bulls thought that was[ the bottom](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fogfty/the_good_news_and_bad_news_djia_makes_best_single/) huh? Think again retards.

This is a very good technical analysis that only like 15 of you will understand, so for everyone else you got juked by the fed so get ready for blood.

This brings me to my next DD. ""Priced in"" doesn't mean the price WILL NOT CHANGE. It means the market is already anticipating what will happen and is reacting accordingly. My man[ u/Um5acentric](https://www.reddit.com/user/Um5acentric/) wrote a[ great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fo5tx7/what_priced_in_actually_means/) explaining what ""Priced in"" means and even gave an example so the smooth-brains could understand.

Now to the real DD. I hope you idiots listened to me the other day when I said puts in India because guess what? Here come some tendies. I will repeat myself; Mexico (EWW), Germany (EWG), France (EWQ), India (INDA), and Australia (EWA). These are all decent options. Not Brazil (EWZ) as its already down like 60% or something stupid and not Japan (EWJ) because they seem to have their shit together. Read the DD on my last summary for more info on India and Mexico.

Next Medtronic (MDT). MDT makes ventilators. Ventilators are a hot item at the moment because of Boomer Doomer. Buy calls? If you want but who fucking knows at this point.[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnxxpy/mdt_the_hidden_beer_virus_gem/) gets into it a little more than I can here.

[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fohxo4/mtch_717_90110c/) says Match (MTCH) which includes Tinder is going to go up because everyone is horny from the Beer Flu. Our wives/wives' boyfriends/dogs/fingers arent enough so random strangers from an app will have to do. He also explains a bunch of shit about profitability and the like the maybe read it. Could make some money, could not. Such is the nature of WSB.

Now, a little mayo for you tards to eat (that means this will help you).[ This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fopuyx/daddy_where_does_money_come_from_birds_bees_long/) explains how to make money by looking at how companies handle their bond debt and are gonna be able to pay it off. If they cant, short the fuck out of them. If they can pay the debt then find another company dipshit, we can't spoon feed you every play. This is your knowledge of the day so take it in, gargle it a bit then swallow that shit because we don't spit around here.

Finally, a new edition that I'm gonna try and do every time;

Big Stupid Idiot of the Day is[ this dude](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnws9y/no_school_i_got_your_history_lesson_fucktards/). I have no fucking clue what he's saying but he may have ate too many bath bombs.

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

TLDR; Buckle in boys cause we are going down more. The next few weeks will be bloody so hold the line and Valhalla awaits. None of you know what ""Priced in"" means, Medtronic and Match look like good options, and playing on companies bond debt seems like a good idea.

Plays; Puts in EWW, EWG, EWQ, INDA, and EWA. Calls in MDT and MTCH.

Tesla has a TON of cash. Between their credit lines (which was extended in FEB with borderline clairvoyance) and cash reserves we are talking about 8.5B. 

Tesla’s competition has been crushed. Ford / GM/ Fiat, they all have higher operations expenses (I.E. dealerships / union workers pensions, high employee counts, etc.). 

Believe it or not, Tesla has the best ability to fair in this storm. When the storm settles their competition will be hurting far worse. 

They are using this time to EXPAND. Other manufactures are overproducing vehicles, Tesla needs to increase output to meet demand. That’s a good spot. 

Tesla also has a great footprint and relationship with the very hard market of China (which will buy MAD vehicles and they won’t be Ford). I mean PR or not Elon essentially mocked the CV by purchasing ventilators from the source of the virus as overstock and delivered them to the US. Those 1.25k ventilators are now 25% of the ventilators delivered to NYC.

The Fed's balance sheet is currently sitting at 21% of GDP, assuming it has a large increase in value from unlimited QE (it's basically stealing at this point) in the following months, and the economy contracts (for obvious reasons), we could see this number jump significantly higher.

Some estimate it could double in the next year to $9tn, and if we assume a large contraction in nominal GDP, the balance sheet could jump to 33-40% of GDP, which is absolutely absurd.

What does this mean? My opinion/advice:

Japan's BOJ is around 100% of GDP, and I see no reason that the Fed couldn't pass 10,15, or even $20 trillion soon if they keep this act of printing money up. Don't take investing advice from me, but USD could be fucked.

Why DIS is seriously fucked! According to FactSet, 87% of DIS revenue comes from its Consumer Services. 31% of that is related to its hospitality services such as hotels and amusement parks. We all know why that segment fucked so there’s no need to explain. Parks closed = no money. Even if beer virus were to have a cure, it’ll take years for the park to regain attendance. 

The remaining 56% is its Media and Publishing services which comprises of 2 segments: Television cable & Broadcast Networks (40%), so like the ESPN, ABC, etc and Video Entertainment (16%) Pixar, Marvel films. Because of the rise in cord cutting, they’ve been declining in that segment for the past 5-8 years, which led them to want to make Disney Plus. Despite Disney Plus doing well in subscribers, they are still losing money in that segment and its still relatively small, any subscriber growth in that aren’t going to move the needle. 

Regarding their revenues for films, all their recent movies were basically delayed because aint nobody going to theaters now. Fear will persist and attendances will only slowly be regained. Also, the current filming production that they were working on or planning are also delayed or cancelled. This is going to cause a huge slowdown regarding upcoming releases. There’s no fucking way they do well this upcoming earnings release on May. 62% of their revenue is in the US and this virus shit is just getting started as Trump is as incompetent as our fellow autists. We are just going to continue our quarantine longer and longer. People are severely underestimating how the economic impact and fear will sustain much longer. 

So, closing statement: PUTS PUTS PUTS!

I wrote this in response to why he should buy LEAPS on SPY. Some of you nogs are gonna nog, I get it, but if you aren’t retarded just read this once.

It is a medium term investment of more than 2 years, with the option to buy at the strike. Right now premiums are very volatile, and being 2 1/2 years away from expiry and a possible near bottom in the foreseeable future. 

Ill do the math; basic shot at my way of seeing this play. 

You have $10,000 to buy up investments with. Say today you took that $10,000 and bought 90 contracts
of SPY 12/16/22 Expiry at $500 at 1.12 premium, thats $112 per contract, times 90, thats $10,080 total investment. Volatility is high my friend, and boomers are taking their money out the banks, while younger generations like myself can’t wait for the bottom—it means a new bull rally, which every bull run in history is exponentially bigger than the one before it. This means that the chance of touching $500 is highly likely. The fed did this once in the 80’s, once in 2008/2009, and both led to bull runs. 

Anyways...see these explanations.

Here is the percentage profits on that trade with the calendar dates pretty far out (the chart goes further)

Profit Percentages by Strike x Date > https://imgur.com/a/MHp60Qw

Here is what you will have if it gets back to $350 by February 2021 > https://imgur.com/a/If4VBo1

And say you got lucky and the market came back very hard - a lot of momentum on the upside, more volatility and it touches a new high of $400 then you my friend would have what is known as a “10-bagger” in one year, scraping clean with $118,080 minus your initial 10,080, and you scrape out clean with $108,000. Set some aside for taxes and go. > https://imgur.com/a/KSs1wdP

I hope you enjoy reading this, because I enjoyed writing it and feeling it out by explaining it to you has caused me to unintentionally perform a bit of DD. The thing about all of these numbers still leave you with a little less than 2 years to expiry. I’m probably going to make this play myself once I’m comfortable we aren’t in an up down market, because we are clearly way down and LEAPS are a sure fire way to make money, plenty of delta built into premiums right now.

EDIT: Those numbers in the green boxes of the pictures represent your gains in percentage for you little kiddy retards, and I don’t think millenials will become scared of the market, we can live check to check, so people will keep investing, and the S&P will surpass 350 easily. I’m of course being optimistic, and you have to be.

Okay guys so I'll get right to the point.. In case you just left your survival bunker. Recently, J Pow turned on his printing press! The Fed announced unlimited QE, mass Repo, etc. if you don't know what that stuff is you should **100%** be part of this forum so welcome. I just spent the last hour comparing and averaging the amount of securities held by the Feds since 2/19/20 (When the epidemic got real in the US) and the results are... Wild. I'll put up each week prior to the following, average 3 of the mild ones and then show you what happened when J Pow & Co. got jiggy with it. 



First off: Here is the website I got **all** my numbers from. After that I used my wife's boyfriends' calculator and my shrinking brain.

**THE NUMBERS:**

""Okay... Cool numbers retard, strike price and date or ban."" Shut up, WSBGod is dead and I'm grieving with your wife. 

Here are the numbers:

2/19-3/11

Mean: 19,135 

*Cool?*

Let's assume the Fed was spending the average amount through this beer virus... That stupid mean is the number I'm using to show you just how badly they're freaking out. 

When they went from '19,135' to 112,570 that was an increase of 92,162 OR **488.2%.**

When they went from 20,408 on 3/11 to 112,570 it was an **451.5% increase in a fucking week.** 

**THIS WEEK THEY HELD NOTHING BACK**

When they went from 112,570 on 3/19 to 355,488 on 3/25 it was a **215.7% increase from our 451.5%.** 

Not only that, but it was a **1,757.7% increase from our 3-week mean!!**

So... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

TL;DR

All this goes to show the fed blew the market up this week because they're scared. This is a bull trap. The Fed knows our stock market is on a ventilator and dammit, 79 year old Jerry needs that ventilator after he sold everything he owned on the dip. The Fed knows it's only a matter of time before this collapses. It's the end of the month, companies are ""rebalancing"" **aka pulling out like your dad should've.** Your puts will thrive, the Fed cannot realistically keep increasing by 215% each week. The Fed are printing but it's doing nothing but pushing back the inevitable... **HOLD THOSE PUTS.**

Edit: It's been brought to my attention that you all really are retarded and have no idea why ""Big increase = Bad"" so here is a nice comment I received explaining it decently well... I'm lazy and don't want to type one but I will if needed.

I know everyone who has puts has gotten fucked by a giant green dildo thanks to the stimulus, but here’s THE play: College students have gotten utterly fucked by this stimulus. Basically, you are allowed to claim your children as dependents until they are 24 if they are full time students. This is an extremely common tax advantage. Technically, the parent is supposed to pay 50% of expenses, but this excludes funding from scholarships, grants, and student margin. Additionally this is not something the IRS ever questions, so everyone does it. The rebate specifically excludes dependents over 17 (you won’t even get the $500). This means that all the servers and retail workers who’s scummy parents claimed them as a dependent, and lives off a combination of tips and student loans, and who just got laid off not only can’t claim unemployment but they won’t get ANY stimulus money. Not only that, but they can’t even sublet their overpriced student housing lease because classes are online until fall so there is no demand. 

That being said, congress made sure to give all the retired boomers who are living on fixed income anyways and are completely unaffected the full $1200. Thankfully all the college students who are going to get fucked by this will be paying taxes for the rest of their lives to pay off the extra $2 trillion in debt that they won’t even get a piece of.

Renter here. I got this notice earlier this week from my apartment comlex :

Rent Payments.

Our company is reviewing our rent collection processes as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. If our business practices change, we will notify everyone. *We have not made any changes to rental payments at this time.*

Thankfully I work in healthcare and still have a job and can afford my rent, but it got me thinking of how quickly the dominos will fall when rent is due 4/1. 

Anecdote: One of my friends was layed off this week and will have to move out asap as he cant afford his rent April 1, and his landlord cant afford to not collect. 

Im sure this will be a pattern across the country, and we wont see any TrumpBucks for at least a month to help make those rent payments. 

Roughly half of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.... most of these people are living this way because they are moderate to low income workers; the exact type of people who are the first to be layed off. Half of America is going to have extreme difficulty making ends meet to pay their rent this month, and the next, and the next. And if this virus keeps killing people month after month, they are not going to get back to work until the disease spreading and death tolls decrease. 

If the Rona keeps us all home until summer... what happens to all the renters who cant afford housing anymore? 

Don’t you think theyre going to have to sell any stocks they have? Drain their 401ks? Drain retirement funds? These people will be forced to liquidate all and especially their market assets. 

And what about the small businesses that are closed? Cheesecake Factory announced it will not pay its rent on April 1.... I think a lot more businesses will be in the same situation, and will be forced out of buisness as they cant afford rent when there is $0 coming in. A small business loan to cover rent does not make sense if you are out of operations for an entire financial quarter. It is smarter financially to close and then reopen when things are healthy and safe again. 

Some progressive states have a temporary moratorium on evictions, but not all: [States w Temporary Eviction Protection](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-market/articles/cities-and-states-that-have-paused-evictions-due-to-covid-19/)

Even if you are fortuante enough to have a no eviction order in place, these are so far only lasting up to mid April... what about after that? May? June? Does anyone think Landlords for Business or Residential will be able to eat 3 months worth of rent? No. Of course not. 

So dont be fooled by this Quad Witch’s Dead Cat yesterday and today. 

Shit is terrible, and only going to get worse over the next few months. If people are evicted or forced to leave their rentals, then it defeats the Stay-at-Home orders- and they will be out in the streets re-spreading the virus all over again. 

TLDR: Hold your puts, Buy more puts. Use your Trumpbucks to buy more puts. This economic disaster is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. 🏳️‍🌈🐻🏳️‍🌈. [THE RENT IS TOO DAMN HIGH](https://images.app.goo.gl/mJ2gRieyqjeq5QLw7)

\*Note that SPX cannot be traded, as it is not an ETF like SPY. However, it is possible to trade \*options\* on SPX. Also, 1 SPY = 1/10 of SPX.

\*\*Note 2: /u/Northstat helpfully points out that [XSP](http://www.cboe.com/products/stock-index-options-spx-rut-msci-ftse/s-p-500-index-options/mini-spx-index-options-xsp) is a mini-SPX contract (european style, cash settled, and section 1256 tax treatment), but is sized 1/10 of SPX just like SPY. However, at a glance it seems to be pretty thinly traded, so use DD here if you decide to brave the bid/ask spreads.

# [Option Style](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/american-european-options.asp)

There are two option styles: American and European. American options can be exercised at any time the option is ITM. European options can only be exercised upon expiration.

European options are simpler and more predictable since no one can exercise on you early and potentially screw up your trades, so I prefer them for day-trading for that reason.

# [Option Settlement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-settled-options.asp)

Options can settle to the underlying equity or can settle to cash.

If you sell a cash-secured SPY put that expires ITM, you will be obligated to buy the SPY shares at the strike price, and will receive those SPY shares in your account.

If you sell a cash-secured SPX put that expires ITM, your account will pay the difference between SPX index price and SPX contract strike price in cash. There are no SPX stock/ETF/shares, so it settles with cash instead.

# Annual Dividend and Expense Ratios

S&P 500 ETFs will pay dividends to the stock holder. Holding **options** on those ETFs won't get you squat - you will only get dividends on shares that you actually in possess of in your account.

You'll notice that inverse ETFs like SPXU pay dividends just like the SPY ETF. That's because when you're shorting shares (which is effectively what ETFs like SPXU are doing), you get the dividends on the borrowed shares if you happen to be holding them on the ex-dividend date.

Most ETFs will also have an expense ratio, which cover the costs of managing the ETF. These fees have a compounding effect against you for ETFs held over the long-term. The SPY ETF expense ratio is fairly low, although it's worth noting that there are some mutual funds like [FNILX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911628) which offer a 0% expense ratio.

SPXU has a higher expense ratio in relation to SPY, but both the dividend payment (as well as the expense ratio) are effectively a non-factor, because you should not be holding inverse ETFs for more than a few days. In fact, the promised returns for leveraged inverse ETFs are only on a **daily** basis, which is the holding period they're designed for. See [here](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/25/3-triple-leveraged-etfs-and-why-you-shouldnt-buy-a.aspx) to understand the problem with longer-term holding periods for leveraged ETFs.

Also keep in mind that some brokers offer a ""share lending"" program, which will pay you interest on shares loaned to other people who want to short those shares. When loaning your shares, you don't get the dividend payments (the borrower does). But one issue with these programs is that interest paid to you for share loans is taxed at your ordinary income rate, whereas dividends are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains rates (more on this further below).

# Leverage Ratio Vs SPY

1 SPY = 1/10 SPX

1 /ES = 50 SPX

1 SPXU = 3 SPX

100 units per contract of SPY, SPX, and SPXU. 1 unit per contract of /ES and /SP.

/SP futures and options on 3x-leveraged ETFs have the highest total leverage. Use extra DD when trading these.

# Risk Management

First, some terms. **Defined Risk** = max loss is guaranteed to some known value. **Undefined Risk** = max loss is unconstrained.

With options, you can avoid undefined risk when using the right spreads. For example, debit spreads are one way of limiting the maximum potential loss (which is limited to the debit paid to enter the trade).

With other instruments like stocks, you can set stop-losses as the desired loss levels. However, you run the risk of a gap-down, especially when held overnight or over the weekend, which blows past your stop limit.

Therefore, options are superior when it comes to risk-management when used appropriately. **However, not all options trades are defined risk (e.g., naked puts).**

Also note that your risk relative to the leverage ratios above. Obviously you are putting a lot more money at risk in one /ES options contract than in one SPY options contract.

# U.S. Taxation

The following explains tax implications as of 2020 for a U.S. citizen. It may be different if you are outside the U.S., but I can only speak to the U.S. tax code.

[**Traditional Capital Gains**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgainstreatment.asp): **100% short-term** capital gains if holding period <= 365 days, **100% long-term** capital gains otherwise. Taxes are assessed at time of sale, regardless of holding period. Wash-sale rule applies for traditional contracts.

[**Section 1256 Contracts**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-1256-contract.asp): **60% long-term**, and **40% short-term** capital gains/losses, regardless of holding period. Taxes are assessed at the [end of each calendar year](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/section-1256-contract.asp#citation-4) regardless whether you sold it or not. Wash-sale rule is N/A for 1256 contracts.

I won't post the [tax rates](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/capital-gains-tax-rates/) here, but suffice to say as of 2020, long-term capital gains tax rates are much more favorable rate than short-term gains (roughly half, depending on your brackets).

Something else you need to understand about how capital gains are calculated. First, long-term gains cancel out long-term losses, and short-term gains cancel out short-term losses. Only after this can short-term and long-term capital gains/losses cancel out each other.

Some scenarios that help drive home the implications of the above:

1. You trade Section 1256 contracts this year and are profitable. This saves you approximately **7-10%** on taxes levied on your trading activity by trading contracts like SPX instead of contracts like SPY.
2. You hold profitable Section 1256 contracts as long-term investments through the end-of-year. You are hit with 60/40 taxes on the ""gains"" of these contracts for tax year 2020 (even though you haven't sold them). You sell the contract a year after you bought it at a further gain in 2021, and pay the 60/40 split on your 2021 taxes for any additional gains since the 2020 end-of-year tax payment. You would have been better off with a traditional contract that A) would have deferred your full tax payment to 2021, and B) would be taxed at the more favorable 100% long-term capital gains instead of 60/40 split.
3. You hold unprofitable Section 1256 contracts as long-term investments through the end-of-year. You get a 60/40 tax writeoff on the ""losses"" of these contracts for tax year 2020 (even though you haven't sold them). You sell the contract a year after you bought it at a loss in 2021, and get a 60/40 writeoff on your 2021 taxes on any additional losses since the 2020 end-of-year tax deduction. You have done yourself a favor in this case because A) you reduced your taxes in 2020 instead of deferring losses to 2021, and B) you have more useful short-term losses to offset other higher-taxed short-term gains, rather than 100% long-term losses for traditional contracts held for over 1 year. (If you're wondering why you can't take advantage of (A) for traditional contracts, lookup the Wash Sale rule.)
4. You trade traditional contracts this year and are unprofitable. Your losses are 100% short-term capital losses, which is more helpful in offsetting other higher-taxed short-term capital gains you have from other trading activities (e.g. those sweet TSLA puts).
5. You acquire SPY shares which you plan to hold for more than 2 years. You collect dividends and avoid paying taxes on capital gains, potentially indefinitely (i.e. if you never sell). Whereas with options, the farthest-dated LEAPs are 2 years out, after which time you would have to realize a capital gain or loss. You can sell covered calls for additional income, but may want to wait 1 year before doing so to avoid your shares being called away during that period and paying short-term capital gains. [It's complicated](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/053115/tax-treatment-call-put-options.asp).

In summary:

1. For profitable short-term trading activities (0-1 yrs), trade Section 1256 contracts
2. For unprofitable short-term trading activities (0-1 yrs), trade traditional options contracts
3. For profitable long-term trading activities (1-2 yrs), trade traditional options contracts
4. For unprofitable long-term trading activities (1+ yrs), trade Section 1256 contracts
5. For profitable long-term bets with > 2 year holding period, hold SPY shares. Sell covered calls after 1 year holding period for additional income if desired.

# Relative Liquidity

Since 1 SPY = 1/10 SPX, we expect bid/ask spreads for SPX options to be 10x as big as SPY. Anecdotally in the last couple weeks, I saw larger spreads than expected in SPX options, especially when IV got pumped up. This is the primary drawback I have seen so far trading SPX options.

/ES futures are very solid in daytime trading hours. I haven't traded /ES options and SPXU or SPXU options, so I'm not entirely sure how they compare.

# Contract Expirations Traded

Keep in mind that different contract expirations will have different liquidity. In general, I have seen the highest liquidity for monthly contracts. Near-dated weeklies can be alright, but I usually see the largest volume on the monthlies.

I would avoid the quarterlies on SPX, as they seem to have the lowest volume. LEAPs are somewhere in between, and obviously is your only choice for long-term speculation besides owning SPY shares outright.

# Exchanges and Hours Traded

Different contracts trade on different exchanges, and each exchange can have its own rules about hours of operation, comissions, etc.

For this reason it's possible that the **same** contract could trade at **different** hours depending which exchange your contract is traded on.

For example, CBOE allows for options trading on its exchanges for another 15 minutes after markets close, but this is not true for all exchanges. Furthermore, the **same exchange** can have **different trading hours** for **different contracts**.

It gets even more crazy when you look at holidays and other special events, as different exchanges have different rules about when they shutdown depending on the day-of-week that different holidays fall on.

Depending on your broker, you may be able to select the desired exchange explicitly, or your broker may offer a ""smart order router"" which tries to intelligently route your order to the exchange with the best fill price.

# Commissions

Commissions vary widely depending on the exchange your order is routed to, in addition to your broker's fees. There are a lot of gotchas here. For example, some brokers  (e.g. IBKR) levy heavy fees for trading /CL compared with other futures.

More generally, the total commissions you pay will depend on the type of contract, and will be inversely correlated to the leverage ratio. In other words, it's cheaper to trade one /ES options contract than it is to trade the equivalent 250 SPY options contracts. However, being mindful of your risk tolerance is the more important consideration here.

# Reasons to trade leveraged inverse ETFs?

I haven't traded the inverse ETFs, so I don't know as much about them. However my understanding is that it could be advantageous to trade SPXU rather than buying premium-rich puts in a high-IV environment, or if you want to avoid the possibility of IV crush. There are also other ways to hedge IV (e.g. put spreads, options contracts placed on the VIX, etc). However, they have their own set of [gotchas](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/25/3-triple-leveraged-etfs-and-why-you-shouldnt-buy-a.aspx).

# TL;DR

We'll make the assumption that you're profitable, and that your primary motivation is choosing the most tax-advantaged strategy which matches your investment horizons. In this case:

1. Use **SPX options, /ES, and /ES options** for short-term trades (trades closed in less than 1 year).
   1. Be careful if you hold any of these contracts through the end of the calendar year (you'll owe taxes on any gains because they are ""marked to market"").
   2. Consider **SPXU** and/or spreads or VIX IV hedging if IV is too high to buy straight puts.
2. Use **SPY LEAP options** for trades that will last 1-2 years.
   1. Either roll-out at expiration for another 1-2 years, or exercise to hold SPY shares (see #3 below).
   2. In current high IV environment, cash-secured puts and put credit spreads work well for long-term bullishness.
3. Hold **SPY** shares if you plan to keep them for over 2 years.
   1. SPY shares can be initially acquired with long-dated leaps above, or via a short-dated cash-secured put if you want to own spy shares sooner.
   2. Optionally begin selling covered calls for additional income after holding shares for 1 year.

# TL;DR of TL;DR

Trade Index Options like SPX and futures instead of SPY to save on taxes and stick it to the IRS. Don't give mnuchin any more of your tendies, make him get them from big daddy powell instead. Money printer go brrr already and doesn't need your help, so don't give it.",2020-03-26 21:48:12

Brief gloat: fucking told you.  Now that that's done, you have to stop buying into these hype trains that keep popping up.  I'm sure many of you now realize that this system is rigged.  The Fed will cheat their way to green no matter what it takes.  [They just purchased 11 billion in treasuries](https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/1243186580027777025?s=20), and will continue to inject liquidity to prop up the market temporarily.  The stimulus, the Fed's actions, and the extremely oversold status of the market will all contribute to this bleed up, but as we saw yesterday when SPY crashed from 255-245 suddenly, this is not a healthy market and this climb will not last.  

So here's my game plan for anyone that wants to follow.  I have a  small position in 4/9 262 SPYc that I'm sitting on until tomorrow afternoon.  I believe we continue to rally to 265-270 as predicted by u/variation-separate and others.  If the hourly RSI starts breaking 70 tomorrow, I'll start averaging into SPY puts.  Small amounts only with 4/17 or later strikes because I don't know how long this bounce can be propped up.  We're seeing New Orleans and Miami becoming new epicenters for the virus, and Atlanta and New York ICU's are now completely full.  Once the stimulus anticipation and hope start to fade, and Main Street becomes more and more affected by the  virus, we will likely see another drop, and will probably test new lows.  

If we get to 270, I'll be looking at 4/17-4/24 240, 230, and 220 puts.   Don't be the fucking idiot that buys 4/8 150 FD's.  Pay a little extra and give yourself time and realistic numbers.",2020-03-26 19:12:52

There are data available for two places: Nembro (population: 11,000) and Bergamo (population: 120,000). 

Nembro was one of the town were the outbreak started (it is the equivalent of New Rochelle in New York), Bergamo is the closest city and where the main hospitals are. Bergamo later on became the most affected city in Italy. 


First, the town, Nembro (January 1st - March 24th 2020) :

OFFICIAL DEATHS COVID-19: 31


OFFICIAL DEATHS: 158


AVERAGE NUMBER OF DEATHS (2015-2019): 35

TLDR: Deaths are x5 the average in a town in Italy and x2 the average in a small city (data still missing tho, it will get worse). The official stats of death related to coronavirus are much lower.

- people are dying of other things because the hospitals are overcrowded and they cannot be treated


- people are dying of coronavirus but it's not possible to test them all.",2020-03-26 17:29:34

So now I'm gonna take some more adderall and rewrite it because that's how sure I am this stock will make you guys tendies (not really, I'm retarded). There's a couple recent DD's on this but they're all trash and leave out some pretty big things.

CACC, or Credit Acceptance Corporation, is absolutely fucked and let me tell you why-

Some background: CACC provides dealer financing programs that enable automobile dealers to sell vehicles to consumers, regardless of their credit history or even a lack of one. Basically, they partner with dealers by paying some upfront cash, then split those future cash flows with the company as the company recovers the advance plus some profit. 

CACC's business model relies bigly and pretty much entirely on debt collection tactics. Because of this, this company thrives almost entirely upon where we're at in a credit cycle and in the economy. And where we're at in a credit cycle is directly linked to employment as shown in this graph: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1gn76hmf50p41.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f62e6b9b212461254f249e4eeb010014e5ab689b

When unemployment numbers come out tomorrow, this *should* go down... a lot. I don't think investors are accurately or are even remotely close in pricing in just how bad unemployment will be and/or get because of this virus in the short term and future.

Now even pre-beer flu this company has been a risky investment. Besides making loans to borrowers with bad to even no credit, which despite what you're probably thinking, is actually very profitable under the right circumstances (which they soon won't be) and legit, they've had and still do have a crazy high valuation and its accounting is also pretty sketch and opaque as they make it difficult/near impossible to see how their loans are really doing. Credit Acceptance uses a form of “level yield accounting” that is normally applied to purchases of already impaired loans. This means Credit Acceptance doesn’t disclose what portion of loans are delinquent or have defaulted.

Instead, CACC publishes the percentage of loans they believe they'll be able to collect for each period. This has also been one of the biggest drivers of this stock's performance and it will definitely take a hit as they surely have a fuck ton of shitty-credit delinquents who are most likely laid off and unable to afford their car payments. Even the ones with good credit scores will have the same problems.

Another major driver of this stock's performance is car loan volume. Who the fuck is going to be buying a car anytime soon? Absolutely no one. Easily 30 to even 50% of their dealerships can't/won't be able to survive this downturn.

Historically, cars represent economic success and if the government doesn't address this soon, they'll have even more problems on their plate. Considering democrats have had hawk-eyes on this industries' practices for a while, something will definitely happen soon and it won't be good for CACC. 

They'll definitely be placing a lower cap on auto-loan rates soon to incentive people to buy cars and might even temporarily ""forgive"" people's inability to pay their car payments like they did for renters in order to prevent them from defaulting on their loans and damaging their credit score and/or having their cars repossessed. If they were fine with fucking over landlords like that, they'll definitely be okay fucking over greedy auto-loan companies. Especially since if people don't have cars, they don't have jobs.

Another signal this company is going downhill is that insiders are selling shares. A week ago, one sold 11,000 and just 2 days ago another sold 10,000.

*Another* thing that's worrisome about this company (yes, *there's more)*, or it's industry in general, is that if you take a look at history, you'll see a lot of parallels between the subprime auto market right now and the housing market in 2008 right before it got absolutely fucked.

Currently, the default rate on subprime auto loan securities is among the highest levels ever. Just like subprime autos, the market got bigger and bigger and bigger for subprime housing and then once demand started falling short (again, who the fuck is buying cars?), it fell. And it fell hard... [https://2o9ub0417chl2lg6m43em6psi2i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/graph-1-1024x768.png](https://2o9ub0417chl2lg6m43em6psi2i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/graph-1-1024x768.png)

That was the biggest factor contributing to the mortgage crisis and if the government doesn't do anything about this relatively soon for the auto-loan industry, it could surely reoccur. Either way, it's a win-win for short sellers.

The technicals on this stock are also pretty bearish. From the start of the coronavirus fear (late Feb.) until now, CACC has only dropped 30%, 400 to 280 (was down 50% on Monday). It's biggest competitor, Santander Consumer Holding (SC), has dropped 40% (60%). Compared to SC, and basically every other stock in the market, this stock still has a lot of room to fall. This might not indicate that much however. The 2-week RSI is currently at 39.31, signaling decently stable price movements. On the other hand, CACC's stochastic reading of 24.98% signals it was way overbought yesterday. 

Technical charts indicate CACC would settle between $276.02 to $291.8. However, if it trades below $237.34, then the market for CACC becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $214.44.

The bull argument for CACC however is that Credit Acceptance could possibly benefit from a downturn in the economy by weeding out competitors that have consistently underpriced loans and hurt industry per-unit profitability. Also Gen Xers are the most likely to have a car loan and carry the highest balances. Gen Xers are also very likely to die from beer flu and their assets will probably cover the rest of their loans.

TL;DR If you're confident that the economy and/or the credit cycle is fucked buy 4/17 250 puts or 5/15 240 puts if you aren't concerned about volume or OI.

P.S. Take this DD as you will, but I wouldn't just read the TL;DR and impulsively listen to me as I'm retarded and my portfolio can back that.

Now I don't know if you autists have been noticing lately but there's not much use for oil with the beer virus running rampant. Especially since we're all trapped in our wife's boyfriend's basement. Take a look at these nicely color-coded piecharts that even you can understand.

You know what happens when America is screwed, and Transportation is screwed? **Oil goes tits up.**

Now add that to the fact that we already have commonplace news of a Saudi-Russian oil war and the talks falling through. After April 1st, well let's hear from Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak who said that **from April 1 neither OPEC nor non-OPEC countries have any restrictions on production.** [https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-oil-output/saudi-arabia-to-hike-oil-output-above-10-million-bpd-in-april-after-opec-deal-collapse-idUKKBN20V0B0](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-oil-output/saudi-arabia-to-hike-oil-output-above-10-million-bpd-in-april-after-opec-deal-collapse-idUKKBN20V0B0)

I think you can get what he's hinting at here (oil armageddon). Saudi is ramping up production like invasive rabbits but sources say Russia can handle a price drop better than Saudi. There's also articles like this [https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2020/03/24/oil-prices-could-plunge-to-10-a-barrel-swamp-storage-capacity-report-says/#3e8d6ef435ac](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonconstable/2020/03/24/oil-prices-could-plunge-to-10-a-barrel-swamp-storage-capacity-report-says/#3e8d6ef435ac) that say oil will drop to $10.

There's a few ways you can profit off of this:

**1. ETFS**

Buy **$DWT (3x inv GSCI Crude index)**/short **$UWT (3x GSCI)**. These don't have options, but they aren't pussy either.

Want to trade options?

Puts on **$USO** and **$XLE.** This is riskier cause it's more affected by Donnie Pump but I can't imagine it going up over the next month.

**2. Oil Stocks**

Idk literally any oil company that can't support itself with less than $20 a barrel (everyone). Watch out for bailouts.

**Tl;dr: Puts on OIL expiring late/April or Buy DWT**

**Ex: $XOM 30p 5/1**

If I'm missing something and all of this is priced in please say something down below. I want to say this is a DD but with how volatile the market's been it can easily be a shitpost. Just be careful as always when trading this commodity.

&#x200B;

They work a lot with UW, I got a bit confused since I saw UW symbols on their website. 

Disclaimer: I'm not an epidemiologist, just a normie engineer who likes math. However I've been paying a lot of attention to the PhD epidemiologists and MDs here in Seattle, and I thought I'd share a few things they've linked.

So UW Medical Center has been on top of this shit since the very beginning.  They have a highly-esteemed epidemiology program, and most of their predictions have come true so far.  I trust them; the only reason Seattle isn't an absolute catastrophe like NYC is because of UW Med Center and Fred Hutch sounding the alarm early, and everyone here listening to them (unlike the rest of the country...).

~~They~~ IHME, who works with UW, released a new tool using epidemiology models, attempting to predict peak resource use:

https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections

This tool is really useul and morbidly fascinating, it provides a ton of information.

Note that this isn't predicting # of infections, it's focusing on hospitalizations and deaths.  Why? Well as everyone in this sub knows, the data we have on # of infections is both noisy and likely inaccurate due to lack of testing.  Building models on inaccurate data generally doesn't end well.  But hospitalizations and deaths are a pretty good indicator of how bad things are going to get, and they aren't affected by test shortages as much. And the lack of hospital beds and ventilators is why we shut down the economy in the first place (thus most useful for trading IMO). 

Some takeaways after playing with this tool:

* They predict we'll need 231k beds, 35k ICU beds, and 19k ventilators nationwide
* They predict a shortage of ~50k beds, ~15k ICU beds, and ~19k ventilators nationwide
* They predict 80k people will die nationwide (yikes)
* This is a *model*, and like all models, there is still a lot of uncertainty as to what will actually happen IRL.  The real world is more complex.  Thus, the model includes *confidence intervals*. For those too dumb to know what that means, it means the numbers I wrote above are expected values, but it could be a lot better or a lot worse based on the data we have right now.  Just like weather models, as time moves on, these confidence intervals should start to get smaller and smaller, reflecting increasing certainty.
  * The number of beds needed could range between 118k to 465k.  If it's on the higher end, then we'll have a MUCH higher hospital bed shortage. If it's on the lower end, we might get out of this without a ton of people dying.
   * **Do NOT bitch at scientists in three weeks if the expected value is not precise.  Only bitch at them if it's outside of these confidence intervals.**  (Even then, they're doing the best they can, so maybe just be nice?)
* Peak resource usage (based on predicted # of hospitalizations) **will be on April 14 for the country**.  If the true values end up in the middle or upper end of the confidence interval, we can expect people to start dying in the ER lobby or at home a few days before this. Maybe base your trading decisions around this date. 
  * You can also drill into this data by state, which shows that NY is absolutely fucked, and the South isn't looking great either. **NY's peak resource date is also projected to come earlier than the rest of the country (April 6)**, so keep that in mind. 
* The model is based on the current orders from state governments (school's being closed, non-essential-businesses being closed, and stay-at-home orders).  If state governments add more restrictions (like travel bans) or lift restrictions, this model's predictions will change.
  * **THE CURVE ONLY STAYS FLAT IF THESE ORDERS ARE KEPT IN PLACE.** Even after April, if these orders are lifted you can expect the curve to go back up again.  Maybe heat will slow it down, but that's unclear, and the summer won't last forever anyway.

The big question I have is, how much of this priced in?  Who the fuck knows.  News out of NYC is already bleak, so maybe that part is priced in.  I don't think the market realizes how bad it's gonna hit the rest of the country though.  I'm also sure boomers are not paying attention to this UW Med Center tool, considering they've ignored everything UW Med has said so far.  

Here are my positions.  I'm still holding puts from last week, which have fucked me, and doubled down this week. I'm a bit worried about my 4/24 puts cause of theta and the IV crush, but I'm thinking the others will be fine. 

DIS $80p 4/24

SPY $220p 4/24

DIS $80p 5/1

DIS $80p 6/19

Mandatory ""don't fucking dance"".  I'm still hoping that the lower bound of the confidence interval comes true.  Don't get a hard on from this.

Edit, from u/SwingLord420:

Heads up this was not created by UW Medical center. It's by a firm they get grants from.

To be clear I know ppl who work there. IHME.

When I let that person know I thought this was going to be a global issue I got laughter. It will burn off in summer. Etc

They have come around.

But their data science may well still be very off. This data is based on how they have handled previous medical emergencies and the resources they can deploy.

This is not like previous medical emergencies.

I expect a way worse outcome because the Midwest is still in denial about this. Those Karen's are totally retarded. They think it's a coastal city problem. They fuqd

\- “Zoom has added 3.5x more MAUs YTD \[year to date\] than the same period of 2019 (2.22 vs. 0.64 million), so even with half the normal paid user conversion rate, this would still yield 74% y/y growth in paid user adds YTD,” they wrote. '

\- The company added 2.22 million monthly active users so far in 2020, while in 2019 it added 1.99 million.

\-Is no big news that corona is causing a huge spike in Zoom user base. However this report was from March 4, quite early compared to the relative widespread chaos we see now. March 10-15 was when North America started going on lockdown.

\-One religious group, The Jehovah Witnesses(my parents sadly) have stopped there church gatherings. The are going to be holding the church meetings(3 times a week) from video application, you guess it, Zoom. 

\-That is 1.2 million JW in USA, another 250k in Canada, all connecting with the Zoom app, 3 times a week starting like last week or this week. I don't even count other countries, who are also advised to follow the same procedure. 

\-April Is the Memorial of Jesus, the JW most attended ceremony. Last year 2.5 million attended alone in the USA. This year it's the first year ever to be held from individuals homes, all tied together using the Zoom application. On Wed April 8, Zoom app will have 2.5+ JW's alone,  just after sundown. 

\-They will be using the app till this shitstorm is over

\-March 4 Stock ticks at $116, goes to $125 the next day or earnings report. Consensus was -0.01, actual was 0.05 EPS. Again, this report ends fiscal JAN 2020.

\-March 6 onward stock heads south with rest of market, towards $110

\-Then Papa announces free money for the world, fire up the printers, and the ticker booms to $160, drops down to $135 the next day.

Well what does all that mean? i dont have the slightest fucking clue. I just watch the lines go up and down and tune in for the first class stories, Yolo retards and the gay babies but i thought maybe someone else on here could make sense of tis all?

If i was i betting man and didnt think the world was going to collapse in a few months, I would go hard long on this fucker. If this bitch can rally to $160 from fake money, Just imagine what actual real money will do? 

Zacks has it at #3. Most condenses are flat EPS, which is straight bipolar. They beat last report by 0.06 a share. This report in June will be up until like april-may. Will hit .10 a share. Send that ticker into the 2 hundos.

This absolutely does not make me a public markets expert AT ALL. That said...

Just talked to our firm's talent partner. Her job is to help all of our portfolio companies with sourcing top exec talent, designing hiring plans, etc. Lately, all of her conversations with portcos have been about RIFs (layoffs). I asked her the following three questions: 

1. What % of our companies are talking about layoffs? Answer: 65%
2. What % of those companies have actually executed on any layoffs? Answer: 10%
3. Do you expect the other 90% to actually go through with the layoffs and if yes when? Answer: yes, almost all of them. Most next week 

Counterintuitively, the stimulus bill that was passed today may actually cause a spike in layoffs next week. This is because in order to get the government loan forgiven (aka free money), you are not allowed to layoff more than 25% of headcount \*from the time you get the loan\* (and if you do a layoff after you get the loan but it's <25% of your FTEs, you can only get part of the debt forgiven). So, companies are actually scrambling to get their RIFs done before they file for the loans and get in line for their free $$$. 

TL;DR - big layoffs coming next week. 3.3M was only the tip of the iceberg.

I feel like the next downward catalyst is going to have to be companies reporting earnings, corporate bond defaults, and actual bankruptcies. This could take a while to materialize because obviously companies would be doing everything in their power to avoid this and it’s only been a few weeks.

I got a notice today that starting in two weeks they were only going to accept ACH payments if you send them a week in advance otherwise everyone needs to fund payroll by wire.

So many companies are failing to make payroll or playing the float that the ach system is being abandoned.  Banks don't trust each other and don't want to get caught holding the bag so they are making everyone pay cash upfront.  Tons of companies on weekly payrolls were playing that float before this all happened.  In two weeks they are toast.

DISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

As is tradition, I shall start with the news. [Boris Johnson](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fpv7i4/boris_johnson_tests_positive_for_covid19/) (The UK's Trump) has tested positive for WuFlu. That=we are fuk. There is news [that GM](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpqf7b/gm_building_mass_ventilators_fake_news_people/) and Ford will not be building ventilators for the hospitals as DJ Trump said. They did not realize the logistics and that transmissions and ventilators are not the same thing. For those of us that cant extrapolates, this means fewer ventilators for victims of China's Plague of Doom.

&#x200B;

The Federal Government and JPow are spending a shit load on trying to keep the SS Economy from taking a nose dive to the Marianas Trench. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpjjde/i_crunched_the_feds_spending_and_it_says_more_puts/) explains the numbers and there are even pictures for you to look at. The Fed is throwing lots and lots of money at this problem to make the ship sink a little slower. Well, they can't do that forever and today is clearly an example of that. Money only makes people happy for so long, especially when their family is dying.

&#x200B;

Now I know we hate every other investing subreddit, however, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fp4vxy/my_experience_of_the_2008_bailout/) is a good (serious) view of what the coming months will look like and relates what is coming to 2008. We are ticking all the boxes of similarities and that is not a good thing. Not saying its gonna be as bad as The Great Recession but lookout.  

&#x200B;

Next is another bit of knowledge for you fucks. My boy u/fuzzyblankeet did one of the [best breakdowns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fplquv/something_fishy_fuzzys_seas_covenant_breakdown/) I have ever seen using SeaWorld (SEAS) as an example. He explains how to break down any companies 10-K (which is an annual report about the financials, company makeup, etc.). He shows us retards how to do a targeted review, breakdown and understand their debt, and goes over financial covenants. These are all big words but if you read the post then it'll be a lot easier to understand. Reading this post will allow you to do YOUR OWN DD instead of relying on WSB and fucking idiots like me.

&#x200B;

On to the actual plays. Mariott (MAR) looks like it's gonna have some problems because of the Beer Flu. No one is traveling right now so no one is booking hotel rooms. No bookings= no revenue. Expect a drop in earnings, and because of this, a drop in stock price. MAR 5/15 50p is what [the OP said](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpiimx/big_dd_marriott_is_dead/) but I would go for a higher strike because people will want to sell at the price of the stock now ($80) if it drops to $50 a share.  

&#x200B;

Likewise, oil is going to be something to watch in the coming weeks. If America and our economy goes tits up, oil goes tits up according to [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fp9ff7/the_fall_of_oil_and_how_you_can_make_tendies/).  The US economy grinding to a standstill will compound with the Saudis dropping the price per barrel and ramping up production. His post gives us a few ways to profit from the fall of oil including ETFs, options, and stocks. Puts on any oil company that can not support itself through this and make sure they expire late April/May. Note, DO NOT play with DWT or UWT. They are being delisted on April 3rd. 

&#x200B;

(Warning; satire!) Now I'm gonna do a little fear-mongering. So the book of Revelations tells humans how the world will end. The 4 horsemen of the apocalypse will come (Famine, Death, War, Pestilence), trumpets will sound, and the end will be nigh. We already have death and pestilence (which means plague) because of COVID19. Famine is coming with the [GIANT SWARM OF LOCUSTS](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/why-a-plague-of-locusts-is-threatening-crops-in-africa-and-beyond/ar-BB11JOHX?li=BBnb7Kz) 3 times the size of New York in Africa and the middle east. And with China and the US having a [dick measuring contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpsulz/trade_war_part_2/) in the Taiwan Strait we are looking at the possibility of war. Also, are we sure that God said trumpets and not Trump/Pence? Just kidding, this is all bullshit, I don't believe in God. If he's real then he's a dick.  Strike me down where I stand.

&#x200B;

Big Stupid Idiot of the Day is [this man](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpm6qt/ive_been_told_to_come_here_to_make_it_all_back/). Why would you come to WSB to make your money back? What a fucking idiot. I thought that everyone knew we only lost money here. You lose $260,000 and come to the hive mind of autism for help? Fuck off.

Tldr for those who don't want to watch: 
Covid-19 spreads via droplets (coughs and sneezes) and lives on surfaces which ultimately causes pneumonia and respiatory issues. Requires people to use ventilators which is limited in supply. Current American death rate is 1.3%. Italy is 10%. Expects Covid to increase exponentially (up to millions), maybe peak in daily cases mid May, and have an exponential increase in death rate by July. Expects India to go to shit bc slums. Doesn't expect vaccines for 12-18 months. Due to unemployment and quarantine, no one has money to pay for funerals.

Chances are other industries are doing shit like this as well (I work in construction and we are still business as usual) which means our total cases will continue to grow exponentially and will not plateau any time soon like they did in China, Italy, etc.

Do you know all this fuzz about Covid? It is actually way worse than expected, because numbers aren't right.  

So what's up? Simple! There's loads of people showing syntomps that doesn't get tested. They get told to stay home in quarantine, and that's it! Actual numbers for infected people are higher than what's reported officially. I cannot quantify the magnitude of this, but I'd say that the issue lies in testing capabilities that can't keep up with the number of potential cases. How do I know this? Well, I live in one of the hardest hit cities (Parma) and I got more than one report of this procedure from different sources.  

On top of this, a recent article has shown that death numbers don't fit: in this little study performed by 2 physicians, the number of Total Flu Deaths vs Covid Deaths vs Expected ""Normal Flu"" Deaths is plotted.  

Result? There's a spike in total deaths corresponding to beer flu arrival, but the numbers are skewed if compared to expected ""normal flu"" deaths: there's 5 times the expected deaths, but only 30% of these are reported as Covid deaths, what about the rest? This means there's a lot of deaths that are not classified as Covid cases, but actually are Covid cases. And that's understandable: there's not enough tests for everyone, so you go back home and die. No test = not a Covid case. Ez  

TL;DR beer flu numbers are skewed. Actual numbers are higher than reported (for Italy at least), while death % is probably lower than reported (it would get lower with more tests available, see Diamond Princess reports that estimate death % at 1-2 max).  

Now imagine living in Spain or UK 2 weeks from now. Or in the US next month. Peace",2020-03-27 17:02:00

I see a lot of posts from people trying to do just that.  But I also bought IWM at the beginning of the week, and doubled down on Tuesday.  Why?  Because, we were due a relief rally, and it was confirmed when the market completely ignored the 2.5 million jobless claims on Thursday.  That should give you some pause if you're holding short dated puts, or thinking about buying more.  Though, I admit, I bought 1 SPY put at 255 at the end of the day today, because I also believe this is insane.

But, back to it.  As long as people/investors believe that the Fed will make sure everything's going to be all right, nothing will dissuade them from that.  Unless the Fed starts being proved wrong.  The one thing  J Pow said that made me sit up is that this injection won't cause inflation to rise.

Of course, there is the core inflation report, coming out tomorrow before open, though I don't think it will show any great increase.  Too afraid of being labeled a price gouger, and oil/gas prices are dropping.  According to this [study](https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/1995/spring/pdf/webb.pdf), there are some leading indicators that may indicate a rise in inflation.  If we can determine that inflation is actually rising, before the rest of THEM, we would know when to double down on our existing sad sack puts, rather than just waiting for the first big red candle.

So, the study has a list of 30+ of them.  Fine for academia, but we're looking to print before anyone else.  I narrowed it down.

Labor: Unemployment, Weekly hours, Employed to population ratio (Check)

Money Supply: (Check!)

Commodity Prices:  Futures of Gold/Silver/Zinc/IDK?  Not sure how to measure this, since gold/silver/oil have been moving in the same general direction.  Other suggestions?  Is there a total commodities index?  (never mind, I'll google that later).

Others:  [Suppliers](https://www.bls.gov/regions/new-york-new-jersey/data/xg-tables/ro2xgppihistind.htm) \- Industrial commodities.  This is another governmental report.  Any purchasers out there willing to share their thoughts on the prices they're seeing within their industry?

Any other things that J Pow said that were seemingly promised that we can track to possibly get a step ahead of the market, and not just hope and pray our puts will print?

\* Shout out to SonicMerlin on Stocktwits.  He said "" the moment confidence in the fed fails, the market is over.  It could drop 50% in a flash.  Ppl got a taste of that and they’re too clouded to realize it"" which started this whole train of thought.

\-------------------------------------------

Here’s the framework I came up with (I will use SPY as a key index due to its popularity):

Even before the COVID-19 crisis, the markets were significantly overpriced. At the current level (about 261), SPY is still greatly overpriced, even after a 22% downward correction. That is due to both the pandemic and pre-existing conditions.

I believe that the market is due for another major correction of at least 30%, which will put the SPY in the low to mid-180s. The timeframe for this correction is about 6-8 weeks. I base this analysis on the following:

https://preview.redd.it/slawy6t1g5p41.png?width=1596&format=png&auto=webp&s=059650b4cedab876d16a2b7e8debd5146f127cf4

To keep track of progress, I came up with the term “Economy Reality Check Score” (ERCS). It is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of indicators.

# ERCS (03/27/2020) = 18/15 = 1.2

The score of 1.2 is as bearish as it gets. All my positions are currently short. When ERCS goes into the 3-4 range, I am planning to move into cash. When and only when the ERCS goes above 4, I would consider starting accumulating long positions.

Questions and comments are welcomed. If I receive positive feedback, I will release my thoughts on corporate bonds, corporate debt, oil and other plays I am currently actively working on.

TL;DR

Currently, I am holding/purchasing puts in SPY (May/Jun/Jul), largest cruise companies (May/Jun), largest casinos (May/Jun). More plays are in active research.",2020-03-27 09:24:49

PDCF stands for Primary Dealer Credit Facility what is the primary dealer? Good question maybe you're not retarded after all...

Primary dealer are ""counterparties"" of the New York Fed in its implementation of monetary policy, aka banks and other financial institutions which make a trade with the Fed.

You may have heard that the Federal Reserve earlier this month removed the reserve requirement for banks. Thats right your trusty old bank down the street no longer needs to keep any x% of money on hand for reserves. They can make it rain loans to your boyfriends girlfriend so she can start that primo dildo shop they've always wanted to start together, with everyone of your hard earned dollars and keep 0 of it in the vault.

The Primary Dealers current have over 1.5 trillion in reserves that they can shell out right now you think there going to keep that cash at the Fed sitting there collecting dust FUCK NO, they're going out the corporate bond market and stock market and swallowing 1.5T worth of equities because why the fuck not? The reason they don't give a fuck is the Fed will now accept those 100c on the dollar as collateral for funny money from the fed with PDCF. What stops the Primary Dealers from buying calls on SPY at 240 and then injecting trillions into the market to reach the strike + some and then when things go south sell the equities to the Fed for a ""90 day"" ""non-recourse"" I might add ""loan."" The Primary Dealers literally have no incentive not to buy equities right now and then hand them off to the Fed.

Next up nobody is going to go bankrupt. Why because of MMLF: Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility boom boom boom. The Money Market Fund is where businesses and retail investors can make a trade to acquire corporate debt. You buy Mutual Fund A, Mutual Fund A goes out and buys bonds from XYZ corp, XYZ corp issues bonds i.e. debt and wallah the cycle is complete. But wait all of a sudden comes in the Corona boi and suddenly it turns out everyones on the brink of insolvency because we've had 10 years of Fed policy which made money cheap and basically penalized companies for not taking on risk but I digress. So everyone notices that XYZ corp is on the brink of bankruptcy so now nobody wants to give them money for their shit fucking bat soup bonds. As a result bond prices go down interest rates go up and nobody wants to take on the risk plus everyone realizes everyones insolvent so everyone sells their bonds making interest rates rise. So what does the Fed do they make the printer machines go BRRRRRRRRRR lend it to he Money Market Fund and then the Money Market Fund gives the bond as collateral to the Fed allowing all that corporate debt to keep on churning. So guess what Money Market Funds are going to keep buying shit debt and the Fed's going to eat it all up while your puts expire to 0.

Part 2 of nobody is going bankrupt. CPFF: Commercial Paper Funding Facility Basically here XYZ corp is bankrupt and needs to pay bills, they can issue debt and the Fed can make a ""loan"" and buy the debt in the commercial paper market to directly pay their loans. In this case the Fed buys the debt i.e. bonds from XYZ corp and gets to pay down all their debt with 0 revenue coming in. That's right all you SIX put holders bend over and lube up Jerome is going to personally spray money into SIX with a leafblower and there going to live to see another day even if 97% of the worlds population dies from Corona.

Lets also not forget a 2 TRILLION TRILLION WITH A T stimulus was just passed where the government is going to wrack up that national debt to helicopter money into every who dick and num nut. Forget Andrew Yang UBI is here motherfuckers and it starts with your dearest politicians shoving 1.2 into your poor fucking asses. Sorry I'm just mad that I won't get any stim money since I make way more that 75k a year.

Anywho what does this all mean stoink only go up duh

EDIT:

TL;DR Fed can basically directly buy stocks and give loans to anyone they want all while printing infinite money.",2020-03-27 08:26:58

Like many here I was convinced that the markets are going to rocket on Tuesday so we can end the quarter with a whimper and Donnie Boy can sign another pumper chart to celebrate. I woke up this morning to some insteresting comments that made me rethink that thesis. Now I have doubts and a thesis that Tuesday is going to drill to the core with a double breaker (no breakers in the last 20 minutes of the day - then it can free fall).

TL;DR - Do whatever you want with this, do your own research. Personally, I'm mostly long dated $SPX 2000 puts. I've been plenty wrong the last few weeks and this is some deep conspiracy shit that frightens me. I’m following in the spirit of u/fuzzyblankeet and u/Variation-Separate in just putting this out there. Check my fucking history for proof.

Assumptions

\- Index fund investing has been stealing all of the tendies from active fund managers. John fucking Oliver taught retail that the fund managers were fucking all of us by skimming off the top of our retirement funds and told everyone to go pure index funds. Active funds really want to kill the passive funds because those flyover country kids at Vanguard are stealing the hookers and blow $$$ from NYC.

\- Micheal “Big Short” Burry has been telling everyone who would listen for 6 months that index funds are creating a huge bubble in the market. Everyone knows that passive index funds have to buy billions every paycheck Friday as the money keeps rolling in to 401k accounts weekly and monthly. I don’t care if he’s right, a stopped clock is right twice a day, but he’s already got FU private island money and you’re here scratching for tendies in your mom’s basement.

\- The active fund managers are also getting fucked by the quants that write algorithms that trade faster and better than 99% of prep school retards that get paid millions to manage funds. You want a job, you learn “do want fries with that” in school. You want millions? You learn serious fucking math or coding in school. You want billions? Learn serious fucking math, coding, and AI in school.

The Setup

Active funds (including Hedgies and all the other Billions villains) need the passive funds to lose and they have the ultimate advantage, they are not passive, so they can manipulate the market to force passive funds into a losing hand. Everyone judges funds by performance. Middle America looks at their 401k options once every 4 years and picks the funds that have the best returns over the previous 1, 5, and 10 years. They check a couple of boxes and look away, passively investing billions every year and only paying attention when the market goes GUH.

The market just went GUH. Passive investors are terrified to even look at their retirement accounts. They are going to look next week after the end of the quarter, go GUH and listen to Cramer tell them to HODOR! In 3-6 months they will take another look and make a decision to change their investments. Passive investors are going to play the same game but with a real short time search. Passive investors are going to think “that was a slaughter, I need to invest in the funds that did the best Q1, 2, and 3.”

The Layup

Active funds needed a massive boost last week so they could deleverage and get the fuck out of longs while building up short positions. Hedgies needed the promise of trillions to convince the Cramers to BTFD while they also hedged against the forced rebalancing that the passive funds have to do every quarter. They also needed the liquidity from the $4T Fed slush fund so they could quickly shovel of those soon to be worthless stocks onto the passive funds and the retail. They needed the bull trap last week so they could get positioned for maximum profit.

Friday they finished getting positioned, they just needed the fucking bill to pass so retail would think the fix is in and want to shove all their funds back into the market. At 3:30 they sprung the trap after letting indexes go up and the VIX go down so the prices on puts would minimize and went all in on the next big short.

The Slam Dunk

The real goal line is Tuesday. End of Month, End of Quarter. EOQ is what you need to watch. Hedgies want maximum drill on Tuesday so they can pre-order next year’s Gulfstream. $JPOW and his boss want maximum green so they don’t get fired. Passive just has to sit back and get railed because that’s the choice they made. Active funds want maximum profits and bargains ready for the looting.

All of these funds are going to live or die based on Q1 and Q2 performance. The funds that walk out of Q1 with positive numbers and well positioned for Q2 are going to have insane demand in a few months because every fucking passive and Cramer is going to want to follow the smart money while they setup the next bag to pass off to retail while they shop for private islands in their Gulfstreams.

Pension funds

The real suckers game and sideways factor is public pension funds. Several states realized they could pay employees less by promising them outsized pensions. Want to get paid $150k to sip margaritas on the beech? Go get elected or hired as a public employee in California. Every politician is going to drop everything to reinforce pension funds because that’s the actual Houdini golden tit. Public employees fuel a lot of election campaigns. Pension funds that had been dabbling in passive vehicles like Vanguard are going to get railed, shift to the actives and the Hedgies, and Congress and the states are going to pour more trillions into propping up the golden trough of pension funds.

What next?

Fuck if I know. Q2 is going to see a lot of people on the coasts fucking die and that sucks. Flyover country has been acing social distancing for decades, but they are going to suffer death and unemployment. Everything is going to be fucking weird for a few quarters unless some fucking smooth brain starts a war, cause then we’ll be truly fucked. Everyone talks about the market in the 30’s and displays all these great graphs about how the market in the 30’s tells us exactly how this is going to fucking play out. You know how that really played out? World War Fucking 2 was fueled by the monetary crashes and desperation of the 30’s.

All I’m thinking about is EOQ. I had convinced myself the market would rocket giant green dildos on Tuesday to save the quarter, but I had forgotten about the Ackman’s (Mr. boo fucking hoo the travel industry is going to crash, and it did, and oh yeah, I just made $2.6B profit on that crash) and the Hedgies that really do want EOQ to crater. Let’s just say I have doubts and I’m putting this out here to discuss.

I’ve run hundreds of simulations and crunched some numbers to answer that $64T question. Here are my findings:

**SCENARIO #1: WHERE WE ARE NOW**

https://preview.redd.it/ej1hevqekcp41.png?width=1863&format=png&auto=webp&s=95a9ce0dfe2fdfaccd4fad22775c3fa06ea90934

The total amount of infectious people will peak at the end of May with 18M. The total amount of deaths reaching almost 2.6M(!) by Aug. This is a very grim and devastating outcome, by any standards. If nothing changes, this is very possible.

**SCENARIO #2: WHERE WE CAN BE**

If the government implements an unprecedented total national lockdown and a slew of other war-like measures shortly, the outcome is somewhat better:

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/lui3r53lkcp41.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e55151707cfe749a401c65453720cd77953f19d)

The total amount of infectious people will peak at the end of June with about 6M. The total amount of deaths reaching still an unbelievable 1.5M by Sep. This is still a horrendous scenario and we don’t even have proper measures in place for this to occur.

**SCENARIO #3: WHERE WE COULD HAVE BEEN**

I believe if we have had implemented very strong measures by the beginning of this month, we could’ve seen a completely different picture:

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/66hh61wpkcp41.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=3390326d286084deb9888c1478fb96aa49454ffd)

The total amount of infectious people would have peaked by mid-Apr with only 121K cases. The total amount of deaths would have “only” been around 37K by Sep. I don’t believe this is scenario is possible anymore.

Unfortunately, the amount of deaths will keep increasing for a while, even after the infectious curve is flatten due to inertia. My sincere hope that we fall somewhere between scenario #2 & #3. For that to happen a full national lockdown must be in place within 1 week, with additional measures to follow.

TL; DR

Unfortunately, even in more optimistic scenario sims, the outcome is still quite dreadful. Earliest infectious people curve flattening is likely to be in June. Stabilization and signs of first economic recovery 1-2 months after that.",2020-03-28 09:15:12
DD,Mortgage Servicing Crisis Explained,5046,friwc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/friwc9/mortgage_servicing_crisis_explained/,786,1585565529.0,"Pre:TLDR - it’s super long, if you aren’t full retard and want to understand this, read it. If you don’t have the brainpower, there a TLDR. 

I'm a Loan Officer for one of the larger retail lenders. Here’s an overview of how the Fed gone and fucked over mortgage lenders. 

Credit for the content below should go to Barry Habib of MBS Highway. 

THE CORONAVIRUS MELTDOWN
The current coronavirus crisis is having a critical impact on the mortgage industry, which could potentially make the 2008 financial crisis pale in comparison. The pressing issue centers around capital that's required by Mortgage Lenders to be able to function and meet covenants that are required for them to continue to lend. 

HERES HOW THE MORTGAGE MARKET WORKS
Let's begin with the mortgage process. A borrower goes to a Mortgage Originator to obtain a mortgage. Once closed, the loan is handled by a Servicer, which may or may not be the same company that originated the loan. The borrower submits payments to the Servicer, however, the Servicer does not own the loan, they are simply maintaining the loan. This means collecting payments and forwarding them to the investor (Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie), paying taxes and insurance, and answering questions, etc. While they maintain or ""service"" the loan, the asset itself is sold to an aggregator or directly to a government agency like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. The loan then gets placed in a large bundle, which is put in the hands of an Investment Banker. The Investment Banker converts those loans into a Mortgage Backed Security (MBS) that can be sold to the public. This shows up in different investments like Mutual Funds, Insurance Plans, and Retirement Accounts. 

The Servicer's role is very critical. In order to obtain the right to service loans, the Servicer will typically pay 1% of the loan amount up front. The Servicer then receives a monthly payment or ""strip"" equal to about 30 basis points (bps) per year. Because they paid about 1% to obtain the servicing rights and receive roughly 30 bps annual income, the breakeven period is approximately 3 years. The longer that loan remains on the books, the more money the Servicer makes. In many cases, the Servicer may want to use leverage to increase their level of income. Therefore, they may often finance half the cost of acquiring the loan and pay the rest in cash. 

SERVICER DILEMMA
As you can imagine, when interest rates drop dramatically, there is an increased incentive for many people to refinance their loans more rapidly. This causes the loans that a Servicer had on their books to pay off sooner…often before that 3-year breakeven period. This servicing runoff creates losses for that Mortgage Lender who is servicing the loan. The more loans in a Mortgage Lender’s portfolio, the greater the loss. Servicing runoff, or even the anticipation of it, can adversely impact the market valuation of a servicing portfolio. But at the same time, Lenders typically experience an increase in new loan activity because of the decline in interest rates. This gives them additional income to help overcome the losses in their servicing portfolio. 

But the Coronavirus has caused a virtual shutdown of the US economy, which has created an unprecedented amount of job losses. This adds a new risk to the servicer because borrowers may have difficulty paying their mortgage in a timely manner. And although the Servicer does not own the asset, they have the responsibility to make the payment to the investor, even if they have not yet received it from the borrower. Under normal circumstances, the Servicer has plenty of cushion to account for this. But an extreme level of delinquency puts the Servicer in an unmanageable position.

I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HERE TO HELP
In the Government’s effort to help those who have lost their jobs because of the Coronavirus shutdown, they have granted forbearance of mortgage payments for affected individuals. This presents an enormous obstacle for Servicers who are obligated to forward the mortgage payment to the investor, even though they have not yet received it. Fortunately, there is a new facility set up to help Mortgage Servicers bridge the gap to the investor. However, it is unclear as to how long it will take for Servicers to access this facility.

But what has not been yet contemplated is the fact that a borrower who does not make their first mortgage payment causes the loan to be ineligible to be sold to an investor. This means that the Servicer must hold onto the asset itself, which ties up their available credit. And with so many new loans being originated of late, the amount of transactions that will not qualify for sale is significant. This restricts the Lender’s ability to clear their pipeline and get reimbursed with cash so they can now fund new transactions.

MARK TO MARKET
This week - Due to accelerated prepayments and the uncertainty of repayment, the value of servicing was slashed in half from 1% to 0.5%. This drastic decrease in value prompted margin calls for the many Servicers who financed their acquisition of servicing. Additionally, the decreased value of a Lender’s servicing portfolio reduces the Lender’s overall net worth. Since the amount a lender can lend is based on a multiple of their net worth, the decrease in value of their servicing portfolio asset, along with the cash paid for margin calls, reduces their capacity to lend.

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
The Fed’s desire to bring mortgage rates down isn’t just damaging servicing portfolios because of prepayments, it’s also wreaking chaos in Lenders’ ability to hedge their risk. Let’s look at what happens when a borrower locks in their mortgage rate with a Mortgage Lender. Mortgage rates are based on the trading of Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). As Mortgage Backed Securities rise in price, interest rates improve and move lower. A locked rate on a loan is nothing more than a lender promising to hold an interest rate for a period of time, or until the transaction closes. The Lender is at risk for any MBS price changes in the marketplace between the time they agreed to grant the lock and the time that the loan closes.

If rates were to rise because MBS prices declined, the Lender would be obligated to buy down the borrower’s mortgage rate to the level they were promised. And since the Lender doesn’t want to be in a position of gambling, they hedge their locked loans by shorting Mortgage Backed Securities. Therefore, should MBS drop in price, causing rates to rise, the Lender’s cost to buy down the borrower’s rate is offset by the Lender’s gains of their short positions in MBS.

Now think about what happens when MBS prices rise or improve, causing mortgage rates to decline. On paper the Lender should be able to close the mortgage loan at a better price than promised to the borrower, giving the Lender additional profits. However, the Lender’s losses on their short position negate any additional profits from the improvement in MBS pricing. This hedging system works well to deliver the borrower what was promised, while removing market risk from the Lender.

But in an effort to reduce mortgage rates, the Fed has been purchasing an incredible amount of Mortgage Backed Securities, causing their price to rise dramatically and swiftly. This, in turn, causes the Lenders’ hedged short positions of MBS to show huge losses. These losses appear to be offset on paper by the potential market gains on the loans that the lender hopes to close in the future. But the Broker Dealer will not wait on the possibility of future loans closing and demands an immediate margin call. The recent amount that these Lenders are paying in margin calls are staggering. They run in the tens of millions of Dollars. All this on top of the aforementioned stresses that Lenders are having to endure. So, while the Fed believes they are stimulating lending, their actions are resulting in the exact opposite. The market for Government Loans, Jumbo Loans, and loans that don’t fit ideal parameters, have all but dried up. And many Lenders have no choice but to slow their intake of transactions by throttling mortgage rates higher and by reducing the term that they are willing to guarantee a rate lock.

Furthering the Fed’s unintended consequences was the announcement to cut interest rates on the Fed Funds Rate by 1% to virtually zero. Because the Fed’s communication failed to educate the general public that the Fed Funds Rate is very different than mortgage rates, it prompted borrowers in process to break their locks and try to jump ship to a lower rate. This dramatically increased hedging losses from loans that didn’t end up closing.

EVEN STEPHEN KING COULD NOT HAVE SCRIPTED THIS
It’s been said that the Stock market will do the most damage, to the most people, at the worst time. And the current mortgage market is experiencing the most perfect storm. Just when volume levels were at the highest in history, servicing runoff at its peak, and pipelines hedged more than ever, the Coronavirus arrived.
Lenders need to clear their pipelines, but social distancing is making it more difficult for transactions to be processed. And those loans that are about to close require that employment be verified. As you can imagine, with millions of individuals losing their jobs, those mortgages are unable to fund, leaving lenders with more hedging losses and no income to offset it.

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW
Fortunately, there are many smart people in the Mortgage Industry who are doing everything they can to navigate through these perilous times. But the Fed and our Government needs to stop making it more difficult. The Fed must temporarily slow MBS purchases to allow pipelines to clear. Lawmakers need to allow for first payment defaults, due to forbearance, to be saleable. And finally, the Fed must more clearly communicate that Mortgage Rates and the Fed Funds Rate are not the same. We have faith that the effects of the Coronavirus will subside and that things will become more normalized in the upcoming months.


So, that’s what’s going on - I’d love some input on the best way to use this info for trades. Personally I think that mid-sized loan servicers with minimal diversity are most at risk. Quicken isn't publicly traded, Wells Fargo is too big for their mortgage servicing alone to cripple them. 

Edit: adding this - There are three main issues:
1.) margin call
2.) inability to sell recently originated loans with a forbearance in place prior to the first payment
3.) a servicer still needs to pay Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie even if someone with an existing loan is in forbearance 

These can combine to be a huge cash burn. The fix for #1 is just that the Fed stops buying MBS but the second two require legislation. 

So, what servicers are at risk? 

EDIT MADE: I’m an idiot and the original post contained some figures for commercial MBS servicing by banks.

Originally I proposed a ticker weighted in CMBS and someone pointed out I’m an idiot. A couple people have commented COOP - Mr. Cooper has a $548B servicing portfolio, which is massive. They aren’t a bank and are solely a mortgage lender/servicer, so I do like that play. 

So, 10/16 COOP 5p

It has come to my attention that it’s no longer an “if” but rather a “when” that the U.S. Dollar will crash. We’re entering a period of stagflation, impulsively increasing our national debt by 10%, and we’re printing worthless cash as if there is no tomorrow.

So, let’s talk about something that is actually valuable: gold. Gold has barely gone up during our 12 year ~~bull run~~ bubble, and it’s ready to surge. Time to buy some gold coins, right? Wrong. Sure, using physical gold might get you to the front of the line for a little while once the trusty old benjamin starts to take a dive, but let’s be honest, the government is probably going to regulate physical gold like they’ve done in past recessions anyway.

The solution? Gold futures. Actually, gold *mining* futures. $JNUG is a great way to bet on gold miners. Sure, mines are closing down all over the world, but that will only up demand for gold, and spikes in $XAUUSD hype up $GDXJ, a gold mining ETF. When $GDXJ, gets bought up, the gates are released for the $JNUG bulls to drive prices to numbers that won’t even fit on your screen.

It has been super oversold because of all the bagholders buying up $JDST, the inverse of $JNUG, in hopes that the market has reached its bottom (wrong) and news of mines shutting down (which is actually good news, because gold demand will skyrocket further). In fact, $JNUG was just recently comfortably trading at $70 to $80 or so a share, and has now dropped below $5. Will it continue to drop? No. And that’s because my research has confirmed that $JDST, its inverse, will continue to drop instead, especially as last week’s hype will sell off this coming Monday PM and people’s attention will once again be on $JNUG. When people see that the market is red, there is even more incentive for them to get in on the bargain. Inflation in the dollar will keep the surge strong. It will be like a blast of cold air, once we feel the economic effects of the stimulus bill, because I think we can all agree that blowing the bubble bigger is not a viable solution.

That’s all for today kids, be bear or be square. You heard it here first!

DD,24% drop in earnings / 1.58 Months of Shutdown Priced In. Not Nearly Enough. Slow but deeper drawdowns coming,223,fre3w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fre3w6/24_drop_in_earnings_158_months_of_shutdown_priced/,52,1585547556.0,"**TLDR:**

**-Market is pricing 1.58 Months of Shutdown**

**-We cannot stay at these Covid19 active case growth rates for more than 2 months before a vaccine is developed. Since a vaccine will unlikely be developed in the next 4 months, shutdown must be longer and more restrictive.**

**-S&P 500 Pre-Crisis CAPE Ratio of 33, Currently 25.5 without dropping earnings. Long Term Average 17.03. Extremely overvalued.**

&#x200B;

For markets, it’s not so much about the absolute number of infections or deaths in the first order, but how long policies will be in place that disrupt earnings. Currently, 1.58 months of disrupted earnings are priced in. From a preservation of human lives standpoint, this is not enough and a longer shutdown with possibly more restrictive orders will be required.

&#x200B;

**How is it implied that 1.58 months of shutdown is expected?**

As of Feb 21. SP&500 P/E Ratio was about 25, currently it is 19, assuming no change in what the market deems it should pay for earnings is, this implies a 24% drop in earnings.

What is the effect on monthly earnings of the shutdown? Blended profit margin for S&P 500 is 11%, variable costs that can at best save 80% of costs. Assuming only 10% of revenue generated, if shutdown last a year, that’s a loss of $107 vs an earnings of $132 from 2019.

This loss per month is about $9. How many months of $9 dollar losses and a miraculous jump back to $11 a month of earnings to reach our implied 24% drop in earnings?

(-9\*m + (12-m)\*11)/132 -1 = -24%

76% \*132 = (-9m-11m+12\*11)

100.32 = -20m + 132

\-31.68 = - 20m

M = 1.58

*Market is pricing 1.58 months of shutdown.*

**Is this feasible?**

Let’s assume a vaccine can get widespread adoption in 200 hundred days, a miracle in of itself, even in this scenario, only 1.58 months of shutdown would be devastating.

New covid-19 cases are currently occurring at a rate of about 23% of the previous days active cases. At this rate, the current inconvenience felt doesn’t make a dent in the spread of covid-19. In 2 months, we’d almost be at 200 million infected. Even assuming that the previously infected cannot get re-infected, a majority of the US population gets infected before any vaccine can even have an effect.

If we get to South Korea’s rate of 2% through even more extreme practices in lockdown, then things look good where we can actually reduce the total active infected. However, as soon as we stop that 1.58 months of trying and go back to our 23%, we’ll shoot back up to 200 million infected in 3 months. (It took as longer this time because we were starting from a lower number).

In short, there cannot be more than 2 – 3 months where we have an active infection growth rate of 23% before we get the vaccine.

As gung-ho as the President is to get the economy working again, I don’t know if other parties would allow him to given consequences.

This was a very rough estimate with many gross assumptions, but it seems that as things seem to be, there is no reasonable way things can get back to how they were without significantly more sacrifice. The market has underpriced the negative effects of the shutdown. Even in the event of a recovery, valuations relative to earnings were already substantially high relative to long run averages and it is unlikely that they would return to such levels of exuberance in inflation adjusted terms.

While all this is bearish, the time horizon is unclear. Impact on earnings might only most noticeably be seen in Q2 which will be reported much later in the year.

**The Trade:**

Straight puts are ill-advised with IV as high as it is. Bear Put spreads could be preferable in picking expiries further out past July. (In hindsight in writing this, I too realised that mine were expiring too soon)

While it may feel late, long positions could be sold and tax-losses harvested. Alternatively, covered calls could be sold on your existing longs.

In addition, I've personally sold ES=F short.

I'd suggest that we should go beyond this type of analysis to not get caught holding the bag.

For example, here's the 2008-2009 crash and recovery.

Those who were short simply because unemployment was rising had the market go upwards of 40% against their trades at the end of the trend.

But if you had instead used the *rate of change* of unemployment, you would have been long several months earlier.  You may have had a losing trade or two along the way, but would have captured the ultimate turn in the market very near the bottom.

The point is this: think beyond the headline figures.  Ask if the trend is accelerating or decelerating and use that as your baseline market bias. You'll be miles ahead of the average trader.

Since everyone these days just focus on how the bear virus is spreading fast in the west and how money print machines from EU,Japan,UK and US money machine all goes brrrrrr.

I think I should make a analysis on the current situation in china and why they haven't have a financial stimulus plan like what is now happening in the west.

&#x200B;

Prequel reading: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffodk3/supply\_chains\_are\_collapsing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffodk3/supply_chains_are_collapsing/)

As I predicted from my supply chain DD post that I made 20 days ago, where I say that supply chains in china would have a second wave disruption because most companies in Europe and the US would have the beer virus and cause their factories to close.

However, I couldn't predicted two things

1. China faked out virus recovery statistics just to force workers to go back to work so fast, so 90-95% of factories in china are already functioning normally
2. The virus spread in the US/Europe are way faster and most non-essential/consumer focused businesses/factories are already closed before April.

Firstly, why would China needs to fake out virus stats to force workers to go back to work?

The answer is rather simple, if they don't export shit to earn profits(foreign currency) they would face high inflation and would be unable to import necessary items such as oil, food which they couldn't make enough to satisfy internal consumption and to sustain its semi-closed economy.

You may remember that there is African swine fever virus problem back in Aug 2018, which hasn't disappeared till this day and has caused so much havoc to China economy by inflating the price of pork from 10 to 30+ in 2019 and cause the overall inflation rate CPI in china to 5.2% in Feb 2020. [https://imgur.com/a/vTqoHgM](https://imgur.com/a/vTqoHgM)

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-inflation/china-february-ppi-0-4-year-on-year-cpi-5-2-idUSKBN20X04Z](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-inflation/china-february-ppi-0-4-year-on-year-cpi-5-2-idUSKBN20X04Z)

Currently china growth rate is around 6%(which is highly inflated), If we make some simple calculation we could see that china only grows around 0.8% in real terms without adjusting the impact from the wuhan virus.

Because of the whuan virus China needs to close most of its factories in Jan and Feb, this cause factorizes profits in China to new lows.

"" Profits earned by Chinese industrial firms in January and February dropped 38.3 percent from a year earlier to 410.7 billion yuan ($58.15bn), worsening from a 6.3-percent fall seen in December last year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed.

It marked the steepest decline in data going back to 2010.""  [here](https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/profits-china-factories-fall-20-year-virus-hit-200327022511295.html)

We could see the reason behind the virus fake out and that China has to force its workers to work in order to export shit to earn foreign currency to buy those pork and other foods or else it would likely to cause a USSR scenario where every citizen lacks food+high food price which would cause a systematic collapse. [here](https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2020/03/05/COVID-2019-sparks-boom-in-fresh-food-imports-to-China-as-trust-in-local-produce-takes-a-hit)

&#x200B;

However,  when Chinese workers goes back to work no one from the west is buying consumer stuff, I mean why would anyone want to buy anything but essential/medical items during a bloody crisis and there are lock downs everywhere?

Thus, when Chinese workers going back to the factories they found out that their factorizes doesn't have demand from the west and they would simply got lay off. [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-manufacturin/chinas-factories-reopen-only-to-fire-workers-as-virus-shreds-global-trade-idUSKBN21D0IG)  and  [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/the-second-virus-shockwave-is-hitting-china-s-factories-already)

&#x200B;

So the government in china is facing a really tough situation with high inflation and low economic growth, this is likely the reason that china only give out news about a stimulus plan, but doesn't have any since the outbreak as pumping money into a high inflated economy would simply make inflation goes wild. [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/china-pledges-to-raise-fiscal-deficit-ratio-sell-special-debt)

&#x200B;

In conclusion:

1.There are so many migration workers traveling back to the factories which would likely to get shutdown anyway due to lack of orders from the west because of lock downs, so massive lay offs and unemployment

2.Those people traveling across could increase the chance of a second outbreak (duh)

3. China is already in a high inflation rate so they aren't likely to have any stimulus plans since they already have so many debts on building those useless ghost cities that no one is gonna buy! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE-Oa7mAyDU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE-Oa7mAyDU)

**Interview with Cramer**

It happened on Friday evening, here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAqPQKBXkWc).

**Summary** \- taken from the video and a bit of other sources (their website..etc)

There are many corona virus stocks out there but I think this one stands out.

1. The CEO revealed that they are working with the US government. At the moment only large cap companies like MMM are known to be doing so. Being a small cap company the revenue from PPE (personal protective equipment) is going to increase OMI's value substantially.
2. The market showed interest immediately after the Cramer show. Stock price went up 23.6% in AH immediately after interview.
3. This company has distribution centers in the US and Europe for exporting medical supplies (perfect timing for Europe!)
4. Manufacturing done in America! No supply chain issues. Other competitors who manufacture in China saw their production shut down due to the Lunar New Year and beyond due to the virus.

**The Company**

Owens and Minor ($OMI) is a global manufacturing and distribution medical supply company with offices in the US and Europe. They make masks and gloves and other crap that helps in the beer flu crisis. Their CEO, Ed Pesicka, originally an executive from Thermal Fisher, joined Owens and Minor about a year ago. He's been fixing the customer service which bled the company for years. Restructuring the company for the past 9-10 months back to industry standard. It beat EPS in the last 3 quarters. Ed Pesicka is getting results.

**Meeting Demand**

Ed sees mask demand in NYC rise from 20k to 200k-300k per week in just one hospital. The company has ramped up production to meet demand in medical protective gear. From January to end of February there was an increase of 50 million mask production per month. They are **working closely with FEMA, the white house team, and HHS**.

There will be a substantial increase in future demand. CDC guidance on masks is expected to [change](https://twitter.com/DrMattMcCarthy/status/1243891663162019841) in next 10 days. Americans will be advised to wear masks in everyday life. Current recommendation is for high-risk groups only.

**Exporting**

They seem to be in a position to sell masks to Europe as well as they have distribution centers there. Trump keeps saying we can sell ventilators to Europe. Why not sell other flu gear as well?

60+ of their distribution centers are located in the US, with 11 in [Europe](https://www.owens-minor.com/our-solutions/distribution-and-warehousing/). Logistics already in place for exporting.

**Comparing with other corona virus stocks**

The advantage of OMI over other similar stocks like APT is that we know they're working with the US government. Like MMM, but with a much smaller market cap. The revenue from the increased demand will make this stock undervalued.

**Possible Future Catalysts**

1. Change in CDC guidance. Americans wearing masks everyday.
2. Name called by Mike Pence just like MMM! There will be a much more significant effect due to the market cap size.
3. Earnings in two months. Expect it to beat EPS by a large margin due to the January to February ramp up with a very good guidance.
4. (Thanks [dlctrades](https://www.reddit.com/user/dlctrades/))  Permanent change in consumer/hospital behavior regarding masks and other PPE. Coronavirus  is here to stay and that means hospitals will need to stock up the way  idiots bought TP in case of a Winter outbreak.

**Magical Technical**

1. This stock has not gone parabolic like the others like APT, CODX have. Still cheap!
2. Blew away several resistance levels in AH after interview with Cramer - $6, $6.5, $7. Bounced off at $7.8
3. Break out above resistance at $7.8, HUGE gap up to about $17. Now at 6.81.
4. Comparing how much other small cap virus stocks have performed, this will jump to $15-$20 and falls back to about $10 (like the others). The size of the gap also suggests a jump of that size.

TL:DR - $10 calls, ticker OMI.",2020-03-29 13:56:55

Alright you 'tists, here we go. SPY is going to drop, probably down to 240, maybe back down to 220. The question is when, right? 

**[SPY 30 day chart with RSI and resistance levels.](https://i.imgur.com/PBUj9o0.png)**

**Right now RSI level is getting high** but it's not astronomical. We are around 61 RSI right now. Take a look at 5 fridays ago when the RSI dipped below 30, SPY shot up past 300 again. Most of you didn't fucking care as much back then because you were still praying for your MSFT $200 3/20 calls. But now that you are leveraged to the tits in SPY $200 4/17, you are a lot more sensitive to these drops.

Other points where RSI dips below 30, again the market spikes up, but there was a lot of volatility earlier in the month so shit was way more erratic. Now things are slowing down and while the situation with the virus isn't good, it isn't completely unknown either. We can start creating new pricing models and forecasts, even if those forecasts mean 2,000,000 baristas are out of a job for a few months. So our RSI level right now, rising but not crazy. **We are probably due for a drop in the next 1-2 weeks**. I know that's not what most of you want to hear, and it will probably come sooner, but you should be prepared for that.

Now once it drops, what to expect?

**[SPY 14 day view](https://i.imgur.com/F1yzZe9.png)**

JPow's printer can print hard, but it is having some trouble. **It seems to be stuck at 260.** Where else have we seen this? About 2 weeks ago we were dancing around the 260 line as well, having a lot of trouble breaking through. But there was a lot more downward pressure back then, but there was still resistance. (You should fully expect that even this was the Fed and other market forces attempting to slow the drop.) But the virus prevailed and all you tendie counting autists got to collect your puts. 

After that we danced around 238, 228, and then finally went to the low of 218. While that is the bottom that we touched, **i don't think that is the resistance level, i think that is closer to 220.**

At this point, we are seeing a lot of sideways movement around 260, which isnt a great sign for you put holders. Given the gap down from 275 to 260 on the way down, we don't have any other known resistance between those two points. This means that **if we break out of 260 on the way up, you should expect the next stop to be 275.**

One more thing, looking at the gaps between afterhours trading

**[SPY 15 Day Gapped Chart](https://i.imgur.com/aNI1zFM.png)**

You can see on the way down we had a lot of days opening significantly lower than the previous days due to a lot of action happening after hours. Similarly on the way up, you can see a lot of opening higher than the previous day. So what to look for here **once the market starts gapping down, or we have one day that closes low, I'd expect the downward leg to start.** I'd expect that leg to try to test 240. And then possibly 228.",2020-03-31 07:23:42

I’m *clearly* just a gay bear autist passing on what I heard from some geeks

[chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/lwHD9H5i/)

Resistance points
1. We just barely broke through a strong trendline (brr power bull trap?) into a phat double top 

2. Now we’re about to hit the .382 [Fibonacci retracement point](https://youtu.be/Kz6-8nQLRHM)  (Not easy to break through)

3. We’re also about to hit the 20 day moving average and the death cross

Volume

Volume has been significantly lower for the past 3 days. Bulls running out of steam?

So all the technical analysis geeks are saying we’re at a clear tipping point.. there’s a shit ton of people with sell triggers around 265 and if we reject it we should drop like a mother fucker. If we somehow brrr through we might moon.

Fundamentals:

Bears: Virus getting exponentially worse, unemployment, shrunken gdp, etc. Economic impact will be worse than what we thought.

Bulls: Virus is a temporary problem/hoax and we overreacted, pricing in too much damage. The economy is still strong.

If you’re holding puts, don’t give up yet. Maybe hedge or rollout. 

If you’re holding calls, be careful. A lot of indicators say we’re at the top, but if we somehow retard strength our way through you can get rich asf.

TLDR: We’re about 1% away from what could be a  bloodbath.

Disclaimer:  Short position on NFLX.  Not your financial adviser.

I know most of you sheep will see the title and think ""Durrr, everyone's at home with nothing to do, what else are we supposed to do besides watch Netflix.""  Well, here's the thing...Netflix doesn't make any more money on more people watching and actually has to pay more to those cloud tech nerds to take up space on their servers: their revenue is based strictly off subscribers.  I expect gross margin to be lower because of this.

Netflix has grown revenues about 25-35% the last few years, which I admit is impressive to say the least.  At this point, the US/Canada market has become saturated though with 67 million subscribers but they only grew by 5% last year, accounting for about 50% of the firm's revenue.  Subscriber growth is much higher elsewhere...EMEA grew 37%, Latin America 20%, and Asia/Pacific 53%.  Impressive stuff.

However, unemployment is going to be high across the world and I expect to see consolidation or cancelling of their subscriptions, or at the very least much slower growth and even with slower subscriber growth they can't easily offset that by increasing prices because of the increase in steaming competition.  Additionally, Karen's across the US are going ape shit crazy having to watch their kids all day and instead of watching Marriage Story for the 12th time they're going to decide to pick up Disney+ so that little Timmy and Sarah can get even more retarded by watching Phineus and Ferb.

Ok, so far we have a thesis for lower revenue growth and lower margins, but here's the best part...Netflix doesn't make any fucking money!!  No cash flow!! They're literally like the anti-fed.  You fuggers are like ""Look at their income statement, it's green!"".  Ok yeah but that's because everything they pay up front for tv show and movie rights is capitalized as an intangible asset.  Look at their cash flow statement...they're losing more and more cash for every dollar of revenue because they have to keep paying more for tv shows due to increased competition from rivals and networks realizing they were getting ripped off.  Every year they sell off more shares and increase their debt levels but nobody bats an eye.

The shares are trading near ATH and share price has been unaffected from China Flu because everyone thinks that their service is uncyclical.  In the next quarter or two I think we're going to see a drop in their growth and a correction more towards fundamentals which is at $200 IMO.",2020-03-30 22:14:34

This will hurt companies who have spent a lot of money, only for the BeerFlu™️ to come in and mess up their testing.

As much as people like to joke around, the FDA are some strict motherfuckers. It takes an average 11 years for a drug to go all the way from discovery to consumers. The process normally goes 


Phase 1: finding how to make the drug most safe and effective 

Phase 2: finding if it is safe and effective enough 

Phase 3: comparing to the current normal for treatment, and if it is effective enough 

These phases normally go for 2-4 years interrupted to see the effects of the drugs on patients. Patients will go to the testing site to check in and recieved another dose. The BeerFlu™️ will not allow patients to do this, effectively messing up the data and then the trial. The company will then have wasted a ton of money and need to get more.

As always, this is organized from most important at the top to least important at the bottom. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.

&#x200B;

DISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

&#x200B;

We are gonna start with some market anticipation today. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqjeda/what_the_hell_isnt_priced_in/) goes through what has been priced in and what hasn't. With all of us losing money and everyone screaming, “MArKet ONLy gO Up eVEn whEN NeWS bAD?” someone had to explain what is priced in and what's not. So here's what is priced in already; Unemployment, 2-month shutdown, more cases, more deaths. WHAT IS NOT PRICED IN; Corporate, Municipal, and State bankruptcies, credit defaulting (student, auto, and home loans), a longer than expected shutdown, higher than anticipated new cases and deaths. These things can cause problems for the market while the stuff we know about is not gonna cause a big shift. Watch the news, read the posts, blag blah blah you already know.

&#x200B;

So going off of that, [these charts and shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqdy37/covid19_bestworse_case_scenarios_us/) show where we can be, where we are now, and where we could have been in relation to the Beer Flu. It's not looking too hot for us but what do you do? Cases are gonna go up a lot, deaths are gonna go up a lot. Maybe not as high as in that post but who knows. Don't roll over and take the market crumbling like a bitch. Make money from the fall and keep your pants on.

&#x200B;

Now, on to some plays. Owens and Minors (OMI) is [anticipated to make some good money](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr3jk0/owens_and_minors_medical_ppe_working_with_the_us/) off of this pandemic. They are working closely with FEMA, the white house team, and HHS. It beat EPS in the last 3 quarters. Most medical manufacturing companies are gonna do good in this market but this company is partnered with the government and put everything in place BEFORE the outbreak took hold everywhere else so they could be ready for it. Overall a good choice.

&#x200B;

Chewy (CHWY) is also [poised to make a good increase](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfoyd/chwy_earnings_play_april_2nd/) in price given how far they dropped because of the crash. They are hiring over 6000 new workers, they are backed up on deliveries because of the increase in sales and strain on the shipping industry, earnings will be released April 2nd and they are expected to be high. If you aren't confident in making this play yourself, just watch and see what happens.

&#x200B;

As we all know at this point, [Germany's minister of state finance took his own life](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr8u20/death_of_german_state_finance_minister_official/). F in the chat for him but we can take some info away from this. If this guy committed suicide because of everything that's going on then we are looking at some bad shit in the coming weeks form Europe. Expect a drop but don't buy anything close. This market is too unpredictable to do anything close to expiry so be careful. Watch EWG but it sticks pretty close to SPY so it's not a perfect indicator of Germany's economy.

&#x200B;

Knowledge of the day is [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqpbnb/stop_buying_expensive_options_on_obvious_plays/) explaining how to pick a play in this new market. OP tells us to watch for the volatility already being priced into the option price. With obvious moves, the IV will already be priced in so you're looking at smaller returns. Read the post for more info as it will probably help a lot of you out.

&#x200B;

Big Stupid Idiot of the Day is anyone that thinks that [this isnt the truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frfhlt/a_brief_explanation_of_options_for_stoolies/). We layout all this info for you here and you ungrateful fucks disregard it completely. Christ you people make me angry.

&#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

&#x200B;

""Buy the dip, faggot."" -Warren Buffett

&#x200B;

TLDR; Know and understand what is priced in and what is not, cases and deaths will go up and it depends on how high they go if it will be priced in or not, Owens and Minors looks to be going up, Chewy looks to be going up, Germany and the other European countries could go down but watch how close they follow SPY.

Plays; Calls on OMI and CHWY, Puts on EWG (maybe). Overall, just brainstorm what will go down if the economy goes under. There are no 100% perfectly anticipated trades. Be safe but scared money don't make money.

DD,Brazil has a serious problem,67,frtz0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frtz0o/brazil_has_a_serious_problem/,43,1585614531.0,"There are 2 key reasons why Brazils economy will be hit harder than most, and of course its all from CV-19:

As CV19 spreads around the world, it's no secret that Brazil's reaction has been.. unique. [Their president responded to criticism of his inaction by saying 'we're all going to die one day.'](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/brazils-bolsonaro-downplays-coronavirus-risks-were-all-going-to-die-one-day-2020-03-29) and they haven't issued any all-encompassing national lockdowns. As of today, churches are still very much open and gatherings are encouraged. 

Brazil's cases jumped from [8 on march 5th](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil/brazil-confirms-eighth-coronavirus-case-as-it-spreads-across-country-idUSKBN20S2WJ) to [904 on march 20th](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/20/819348888/surge-of-coronavirus-cases-in-brazil-brings-warning-of-health-care-collapse) to [4000 yesterday](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/29/in-coronavirus-versus-brazil-bolsonaro-stands-almost-alone/) and they are continuing to rise. Unlike most countries with thousands of cases, Brazil's outbreak is almost entirely uncontrolled, with national authorities calling it a 'hoax' (that sounds familiar) as it spreads wildly untested and uncontrolled. 

Additionally, Brazil is mostly in the southern hemisphere, so the US's wonderful warm summer (when many experts speculate the disease will slow) will be a colder time for Brazil -- encouraging the spread that much more.

The other key reason is a bit less obvious. Jumping over the pond to the UK, [64% of ICU patients are overweight](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8142005/Being-obese-raises-coronavirus-risk-Medics-warn-patients-high-BMI-likely-die.html) -- that's right. Fatties = hospital beds thanks to Corona. Now lets look at Brazil: [55% overweight.](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/geral/noticia/2019-07/obesity-brazil-198-2006-2018) 

So you have a largely overweight population, which leads to a majority of hospitalization requirements, and a government not taking this seriously in the slightest. Not to mention the cases just doubled in 3 days as we're seeing elsewhere in the world. 

Short Brazil.

Anyway, I come here today not to admonish you for me not knowing basic shit, but to deliver some excellent news for humanity, and sad DD for us gay bears:

# Beervirus may be about to slow down. Hard.

My sources are two-fold: 1) Nobel laureate Michael Levitt, and 2) the last couple days worth of report coronavirus data.

# The prognostications of a biophysicist:

So Michael Levitt is a some smart fuck with like four different passports (probably for tax evasion, idk) who knows some stuff about biology and applied statistics, so much in fact that some other smart fucks from Sweden gave him a million $ and a plaque telling him how smart he is. Anyway, Prof. Levitt has been running the media circuit talking how he predicted a major slowdown in coronavirus case figures by looking at data coming out of China back in February, accurately calling the final case count and fatality number in Wuhan. The guy has no background in epidemiology. He just looking at rates of immunity and historical growth data and did a purely technical analysis (more on why this may be insufficient later).

[https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3800632,00.html](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3800632,00.html)

So reading through the articles, the guy is basically saying he thinks the response to the virus is overblown, and it will burn itself out much faster than most other models predict.

# $RONA chart TA:

So with this in mind, let's check out Worldometer's case numbers/trends for the 'Murica.

[ERMAHGERD. ERXPERNERNCHURL GRURTH](https://preview.redd.it/44f306dagtp41.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5ebbe2c066e76c6ec2b4acb698afe2e5f50c7f9)

Scary, right? But let's look at the log scale growth.

&#x200B;

[Damn y u so curvy tho?](https://preview.redd.it/ydya64mmgtp41.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a741e73e161cca390830f7b678a46b56a92e440)

See that curve down starting to form over the last week? This suggest the virus is actually decelerating, and at the current pace, could flatten out in as little as two weeks. TWO WEEKS.

Still don't believe me? ANOTHER FUCKING GRAPH FOR YOU.

&#x200B;

[Batman, is that you?](https://preview.redd.it/9p2c4tmmhtp41.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dbe0ae61593d30e553928c77e3a65fb3ce75cbd)

Look at the envelope on daily new cases in the US. It's practically a head an shoulders. Puts on $RONA.

# Limitations of the Levitt analysis:

So Levitt is looking purely at raw dater and pure maffema'ics when he was making his analysis, and is admittedly not an expert in epidemiology. In other words, he's not doing fundamental analysis. Let's look at some dates, shall we? February 7th was the date that Levitt observed the downward impulse start to manifest in Wuhan's infection numbers. What happened ten days before? The fucking lockdown. In other words, there were fewer new cases within the gestation period of the virus when the virus had access to fewer fresh hosts. Now we see the same trend occurring in the US, whose numbers are being driven mostly by New York. What happened in New York ten days ago? Yep! It's another lockdown. Or lockdown lite as the case may be, but people have been largely compliant with shelter in place as New Yorkers hate each other for the most part and are perfectly happy to avoid public life completely if they can justify not going to the office.

Now New York is still in the early days of this thing and much of Levitt's prognosis is predicated on the fact that China's dataset is a month or two ahead of ours and they are reporting almost no (no?) new cases. There are a couple risks here applying the China data to US $RONA futures. First is that, by all accounts, China has been controlling new growth in Wuhan/Hubei by strict quarantine enforcement and mass surveillance which includes facial scans and temperature checks through a number of modalities. There is currently no such enforcement infrastructure in place in the US. Also, we still don't know if the CCP is just fucking lying to everyone to restore confidence in their market and workforce.

# Interpretations:

So how should we interpret this one guy's opinion and a week's worth of bullish case data? How the fuck should I know? Stop asking so many questions. Jesus. Go read Investopedia or something.

But, in all seriousness, there are fundamentally two ways of interpreting this.

🐂:  ""Oh shit, this Levitt dude says RONA bubble gonna pop! Load up on faggy D calls boys, SPY gonna bounce to the 🌙! I-shaped recovery!""

🐻: ""Levitt is full of shit, China is full of shit, my wife's boyfriend is full of shit, everyone is full of shit. Puts on everything. Either a million people die because Donny sends everyone back to work early, or quarantine until the virus is dead and we plunge into the next depression or JPow turns our currency into Monopoly: Zimbabwe Edition play money.""

# ""Fuck your wall of text. Do you even have a point here? POSITIONS OR BAN!""

Jesus man, I was just getting to that. Calm your tits.

I'm currently holding SPY 220p/210p 5/15, EWJ 45p 5/15, and DIS 95p 5/15. I may dump everything though ('cept maybe DIS) as I'm starting to think we'll see continued infection declines in the current hot zones and, barring any new locales popping off in a big way, a concomitant slow rally in index stocks as shelter in place orders are held through April. We may however end up seeing another swell in infections later in the year, maybe late May to June timeframe as people return to community life and the handful of latent asymptomatic cases starts to seed the uninfected population anew.

TL;DR: Rally may very well continue through May. But we might be in for a nasty spike in infections later in the year. Maybe buy some calls in the meantime, idk.

Edit 1: So I neglected to enumerate some assumptions being made. Fuck me, right?

Anyway, my biggest and most audacious assumption is that testing capacity is growing. Theoretically, this is correct as CDC is now no longer the sole purveyor of coronavirus tests, and new test capacity is being lit up at labs across the country. One criticism to this line of thinking is that there have been confirmed reports in several states of low inventory on sterile sample collection equipment (swabs and vials mainly), and possible PCR reagents (haven't seen confirmed reports of this). If this does end up being the case, forget most of what I've said here. Mostly trying to start a discussion rather than tell anybody where they should park their money. But if, in the immediate term, test capacity is growing faster than new cases are showing up in ER's in more population centers than not, there may be something to the idea that organic growth rates are starting to level off. Something to think about in the coming days as we see more data points.

Also, I'm coming at all of this from the angle of market perception. I don't think MM's/fund managers are gonna be so concerned with the aggregate number of deaths, but rather the instantaneous rate of death. If they see that nose down, expect some degree of index recovery in the short term. This ignores other systemic financial issues that are myriad, but we know full well that a lot of personalities in the world of high finance are great at doing exactly that. It also neglects the reactions of retail investors and how their associated sell volumes may influence the market during that period. I know dick about the scale thereof, maybe someone in comments can enlighten me.

Also, to the guy in comments telling me how logarithms work, fuck you. I'm an RF engineer. Every measurement I make in the lab is in fucking decibels. For those who aren't aware, exponential growth linearizes on log scales. Yeah we're talking about a finite population with decaying penetration so eventually the line noses down, but given the order of magnitude where the epidemiological models being bandied about in the media terminate, we shouldn't be seeing the top curve of the S pattern emerge yet where we're at, which is suggests case recording is being slowed by some mechanism, be it transient shortages in test capacity or an actual decrease in infections.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Super wrong and big retarded. Puts on everything.


EDIT 3: So did the entire market and MSM read this post last week and decide coronavirus was over? Because it sure seems like it. 

US death rates probably appear to be leveling because we are not counting deaths appropriately.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/us/coronavirus-deaths-undercount.html

Infection spread is also probably still being undercounted.

DD,Why Irving Fisher (1867-1947) would be buying Gold Puts. AKA Two Things /u/Variation-Separate Already Told You.,180,frrhea,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frrhea/why_irving_fisher_18671947_would_be_buying_gold/,88,1585606255.0,"**I. DDeflation**

Your boy, JPOW, is sending us into a deflationary period. You might think; ""Well shit, the man is pumping this market with money printed from nowhere. Why wouldn't this be inflation?"" Because Irving Fisher says so, that's why.

Let's imagine a see-saw, on one side is your fat cousin who represents: an insanely overvalued market, liquidity problems, bad debt, the attempt to shrug off 3.3 million unemployed, a god damn global pandemic, the US leading said pandemic in number of cases despite testing like its some secret, and the easter bunny as the beacon for the end of the beer virus.
On the other end of the see-saw we have JPOW. This weakarmed baby is trying to level the see-saw by throwing his weight behind the lever arm: unlimited QE, rate cuts, some shit stimulus check, and the money printer. JPOW is able to maintain equilibrium and float your fat cousin on the other end of the see-saw.

Then, all of a sudden, a blue chip company in the US Economy shits the bed. Bad debt, a plane that spontaneously combusts due to some moron coder who was hired off fiver, a bank who gave out money to fund your wife's boyfriend's Jet-Ski/DJ Studio goes under. This is your obese cousin putting on a lead jacket. JPOWs weak baby arms can't maintain equilibrium of the see-saw and the whole thing crashes down. Leaving your cousin crying in the sand with some needle from your awful park in his arm.

**II. IrVing Fisher**

Irving Fisher is much more eloquent in *The Debt-Deflation Theory of the Great Depression*[^1](https://phare.univ-paris1.fr/fileadmin/PHARE/Irving_Fisher_1933.pdf)-1933 and compares this to a ship floating in the ocean. The ship will tend to be in equilibrium, but once it begins to capsize it will only further depart from this equilibrium. He surmises that it is impossible to be in the Atlantic without seeing a wave.

He goes on to say that every recession has had and will have two main ""waves""; Debt and Deflation.

> ""in the great booms and depressions... two dominant factors, namely over-indebtedness to start with and deflation following soon after... Disturbances in these two factors—debt and the purchasing power of the monetary unit—will set up serious disturbances in all, or nearly all, other economic variables.""

Let's think about 2008 for a second, some kid is on the street with a RipStik listening to Jason Mraz. His dad bought some house with a variable interest rate they could hardly afford for 500k that is for some reason worth 1.2 mil 5 years later. The Dad takes a loan against that 700k in found money to fund his coke habit and eventually has to declare bankruptcy once the entire market blows up. Now, add a few zeros and make that house some insanely overvalued company that took out loans to buy back stock (which like the housing market is about to shit itself). That's the global economy of 2020.

Our new friend, Irving, had something to say about this in 1933:
> ""Easy money is the great cause of overborrowing. When an investor thinks he can make over 100 per cent per annum by borrowing at 6 per cent, he will be tempted to borrow, and to invest or speculate with borrowed money. This was a prime cause leading to the over-indebtedness of 1929.""

**III.	 Liquidation**

He goes further to describe the steps of a depression (we can be seen on Step 2).

> ""Assuming, accordingly, that, at some point of time, a state of over-indebtedness exists, this will tend to lead to liquidation, through the alarm either of debtors or creditors or both....
> 
> 1)	Debt liquidation leads to distress selling and to
> 
> 2)	Contraction of deposit currency, as bank loans are paid off, and to a slowing down of velocity of circulation. This contraction of deposits and of their velocity, precipitated by distress selling, causes
> 
> 3)	A fall in the level of prices, in other words, a swelling of the dollar. Assuming, as above stated, that this fall of prices is not interfered with by reflation or otherwise, there must be
> 
> 4)	A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies and
> 
> 5)	A like fall in profits, which in a ""capitalistic,"" that is, a private-profit society, leads the concerns which are running at a loss to make
> 
> 6)	A reduction in output, in trade and in employment of labor. These losses, bankruptcies, and unemployment, lead to
> 
> 7)	Pessimism and loss of confidence, which in turn lead to
> 
> 8)	Hoarding and slowing down still more the velocity of circulation.""

For the non readers of the group: companies that took out large loans for stock buybacks are fucked, unemployment and margin calls will lead to people liquidating assets furthering our drop.

Fisher had thoughts on liquidation and his boat. He believes liquidation aggravates debt, growing a depression instead of recovering from it.

> ""They were great enough not only to ""rock the boat"" but to start it capsizing. By March, 1933, liquidation had reduced the debts about 20 percent, but had increased the dollar about 75 percent, so that the real debt, that is the debt as measured in terms of commodities, was increased about 40 percent [(100%-20%)X(100%+75%)=140%]. ""

**IV. The Plays**

**So what did we learn from Fisher?**

1)	Debt liquidation leads to panic selling

2)	Panic selling leads to a swelling dollar


**If you have been active on the sub you may have noticed /u/Variation-Separate calling on 1929 and saying he is:**

1)	Short GLD, SPY, and IWM

2)	Long UUP

**What are these plays really?**

1)	Panic selling will lead to a sharp drop and MMs being called on margin leading to liquidation. This forced liquidation will have MMs selling their best performing assets ie. Gold

2)	UUP tracks the price of the US dollar against other world currencies. If Fishers March 1933 numbers above hold true we should see large price action of UUP.


**V. TL;DR**

5/1 130p GLD

6/19 30c UUP

# Turtle Beach ($HEAR)

***Description:***

An absolutely mediocre small-cap company (mkt cap: $80mm) making headsets that only acne covered teenagers chugging energy drinks in their parents' basements could love. The last time the stock spiked was when Fortnite became popular in 2018... driving insane demand for headsets (and stock was a 10+ bagger) so that kids could play online while chatting with each other.

Company is the market-share leader in gaming headsets with app. 43% in 2019.

***Catalyst:***

Demand for video-games during Coronavirus is soaring with even end-of-cycle consoles being sold out and demand for video games spiking.

Market knows this already and that's why every perma-bull and their grandma is buying $ATVI, $EA, etc.

But what they're not watching is the market for accessories (headsets in this case)

Search for the company has seasonality (search spikes during Black Friday and Christmas... some increase during summer), but you can see that searches have spiked way above trend recently (dotted line is where the search levels should be according to seasonal trends). Right now search levels are around 74% higher than they would be normally. Higher than the yellow line (2018) when $HEAR spiked up 15x b/c of Fortnite driven demand

But why didn't the executives say anything about this during their earnings report on March 10th?

If you want to look at humanity in a good light, they didn't know b/c search volumes started to spike on March 14th. If you want to think the worst of people, it's b/c the money-grubbing exec are buying shares before the stock rallies:

&#x200B;

According to their March 10th earnings call:

They have sufficient inventory and the ability to switch production if need be:

>""And of course, having non-China production also enables us going forward to have the ability to flex production between China factories and non-China factories and gives us just simply a more diversified supply chain...""

They also couldn't forecast what demand would be like:

>""And remember that gaming is something that people do at home for entertainment so just by its nature, it’s hard to judge whether that’s going to have an impact on us or not, but it’s something we are watching very closely.""

It's pretty obvious from gaming trends and trends data that people are buying these mediocre headsets, but that the market isn't pricing this in due the shift happening right after earnings/guidance.

***Upside:***

Change in sales has not been priced in and as stated above... it's been a mediocre company with sloppy execution for years... no one in their right mind would be looking at this piece of shit...

And as with any company of this impeccable caliber, there's a sizable level of short interest (22.7%) and high # of days to cover (10.6 days).

Company has just recently announced earnings and guidance, so the recent changes in fundamentals haven't been priced in. Last time this company had a huge tailwind (sales increase due to Fortnite... current interest levels are higher than Fortnite peak) the stock shot up from $1-2 to mid-30's. 

With short interest where it is and a premium on Coronavirus theme stocks, can see this easily shooting up to mid $20's (small cap so potential for massive overshoot).

I’ve only ever worked a few places in my life but one was in a pharmacy and another was for the US government.

TEVA produces these drugs for next to nothing, made in a giant vat and chopped up into pill form for distribution. The cheapest place you can buy a bottle of 30 tablets is Walmart for around 75 dollars.

To do some quick math we have a few options: 8,000,000/30 per bottle= 266,666x$75 = 20 million dollars. That’s the low end.

Knowing the government, they’ll pay more. Probably a lot more. An X factor to throw into the mix is that Trump mentioned “doses”. Ordinarily for Malaria prevention/recovery a patient would take chloroquine for at least a week. A dose in this case could be 7-10 tablets per person. If that’s the case, we’re not talking 8 million tablets, that’s 56 million. More math: 56,000,000/30 per bottle = 1,866,666 bottles at a MINIMUM $75 per bottle: $140 million dollar USG contract for something that probably costs them about tree fiddy to make.

TEVA doesn’t only make chloroquine, they also provide generics for about every old boomer condition you can think of: Statins, depression meds, thyoid meds, you name it. Considering the only places that are open right now are Wendy's drive thru, pharmacies, and some big navy boat hospital bois, they're still making money right now.

lazy ppl TLDR; Antibody-tests are on their way. As soon as they start **broad testing, get CASH GANG**

&#x200B;

1) Introduction

Let me explain.

Something that has not been discussed a lot from what I hear on discord/read in the sub: **antibody** testing. Yeah I get, shit is bad and world will collapse and so on but hear me out - the permabulls will take any major positive news for a good 10% rally. 

Antibody testing is already done in New York and testing capacities are about to be expanded:

[https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037713v1)

Additionally the head of the Charitè  - most reputable medical institution in Germany - announced that there will be anti-body testing of big groups in **around 2 weeks.**

Source (GERMAN - ENG sub):  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GNhq1LHhQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4GNhq1LHhQ)

&#x200B;

2) Conclusion

While we are riding into an economic armageddon, we still wanna ride the waves up and down. After we will get a big downie from SPY being rejected at 263, we will still see a **massive rally** at the time when **antibody tests are shown to be effective in just a single country** because it will most likely be the same data for all the other countries. I can only give a timeframe, which would be somewhere between  **4/14-21**

&#x200B;

3) Side-takeaway:

Everyone who is doing ""diamond"" hands - if you don´t have leaps, you should probably switch to trading with the trend/go more Cash because while we will get a lot of bad news - there will also be very promising good news soon.

We are a travel company, so this obviously isnt a surprise. However, what I can tell you is that the amount of cash on our balance sheet(not gonna link, its public info, my only hint will be that we trade on the asx and lost 80% of our value in the last month and trading is still halted for our stock) is 70% client cash. This means we collected it from customers but owe it to our suppliers and vendors. It means we report that as cash on hand but never actually realize it ourselves.

This illustrates how fucked many companies are. Even if they were solvent. All it takes is a few months without revenue and these companies cannot stay above water. No matter how much money any government throws at these corporations, it will not matter, because there is no customer base.

FWIW I am bagholding SPY 230P for 4/6 and 4/17. I still think there is another leg down, short term volatility cannot be predicted, I am not buying anything for a long term hold today. This is just a perspective on the mid to long term. 

Abbott Laboratories got emergency permission from the FDA to produce their COVID-19 test that produces a positive in as little as 5 minutes, negative in 13. They are going to produce 5 million tests in April: https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/product-and-innovation/detect-covid-19-in-as-little-as-5-minutes.html


This has implications FAR beyond the immediate benefit in flattening the curve and saving front-line healthcare workers, BOTH OF WHICH IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANTLY. The 5 million tests being produced are basically fancy swabs to put into a machine, as described, about the size of a toaster. 


This medical toaster. Fancy medical machinery, must be expensive, right? Is $10,040 expensive? https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-influenza-a-b-alere-i-instrument/23046617


It may be for your broke ass. Is $10,040 expensive for your local Walmart store, to test all their employees before their shift starts in the flu season? 

Do American parents think $10,040 is too big of a one-time cost for little Susie's elementary school to test the teachers likewise? 

Is $10,040 too expensive for Disney to put one in EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEES-ONLY AREA AT DISNEY WORLD? 


They will obviously get FDA approval, if not the model as-is, they will revise it. I am speculating that production at massive scale will make swab costs negligible in the long term. Larger players and metro areas will have the cash to buy in sooner. 


By Fall life is back to normal with some adjustments, economy back to normal, if it isn't already. As I write this out I'm not actually sure we've even going to have another big leg down at all. (Until the consequences of infinite money come about, which could be 3 months to never)


TL;DL: By 2021 you will be subject to forced rectal swabs by both government and private parties at will, but SPY is at 400 and grandma is probably still alive.


EDIT: I would love to hear the a bearish take on this. My own further research:

-Flu A/B tests cost about $100 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-flu-a-b-2-mod-24t-pk/23046634

-Strep A/B tests are about $77 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-strep-a-2-test-kit/23046632

-RSV test kits are $90 each: https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/alere-i-rsv-test-kit-24-pk/23043632

-They also sell ""control swabs"" at approx. $20 each that are sold in pack of 24; I assume these are consumable as well. 


So a flu test is $120 inclusive, today. I don't know how much flu testing is being done. Unknown factors then are the starting price of the COVID-19 test module, whether this demand for non-medical testing I'm predicting will materialize, and how low the cost per test can go.

Edit: I recommend reading /u/clangdo3's comments below, he adds some great color as well.

I’ve been getting questions about oil trickling in since /u/fuzzyblankeet started writing his outstanding corporate debt threads and I wrote about it in one of them, so I figured I would give you guys a (short, but terribly long for you autists) primer on the oil and gas industry, demand destruction and the price war. TL;DR’s will be provided in sections for the lazy or can’t be bothered.

I’m not giving you trades because 1) you need to do your own DD on specific companies (I briefly looked at finances for Oxy and Devon in fuzzy’s first thread if you want to go find that); fuzzy’s suggestions are a good place to start, particularly for US shale companies 2) I’m not an experienced options trader and you don’t need me giving you full-retard plays.

As far as my background, my full-time job involves covering the news in the sector for an industry-specific data and analytics company. You have to pay more than pocket change to read my good stuff, but I'm several orders of magnitude less expensive than fuzzy. I mainly cover the Canadian and international upstream markets, but I have dabbled in the rest of it, including capital markets, and I understand the broad strokes of US shale.

**Definitions**

**TL;DR If you know nothing of the oil and gas industry, you may need a bit of a down-and-dirty glossary to get started. I wrote this first, so I may not use all the terms listed (and I certainly didn’t list all the terms there are), but they are good to know anyways. Skip if you have at least a passing familiarity with the industry.**

· Upstream – Essentially exploration and production. These are the companies (or divisions of supermajors) that find the oil and gas and pull it out of the ground.

· Midstream – Transportation and storage. Moving produced oil and gas by pipeline, truck, ship, railcar, etc. and when needed, storing them.

· Downstream – Refineries and plants. These are the guys that turn unprocessed crude and gas into end-use or intermediate products.

· Oilfield Services – These are the companies that help upstream companies get their shit. They may shoot seismic to help find prospects, run land or offshore rigs to drill wells, build infrastructure, provide drilling fluids or other chemicals, and a whole host of other shit.

· Conventional – These wells are the traditional image of how oil and gas gets produced. You drill a well (mostly) straight down and you find a pocket of oil and/or gas or you don’t. Good rock with high permeability and porosity. Most offshore production is conventional. It also typically has lower decline rates.

· Unconventional – This is essentially shale. Tight rock with low permeability and porosity. You drill down to the rock and then drill a lateral section, so you have as much pipe in the pay zone as possible. Then you use that evil fracking shit to break the rock up so oil and gas flow. These wells are often comparatively more expensive to drill, and the output declines quickly, so you have to constantly drill new wells if you want to maintain or grow production. Unconventional shale is what led to the US boom in production in recent years.

· Oilsands – Canada. This can either be mined to produce bitumen or extracted through things like steam-assisted gravity drainage (pump steam into ground to heat up the bitumen and make it less viscous). It has to be blended with diluent (very light oil or condensates) to move in pipelines and is processed into synthetic crude.

· Light vs Heavy oil – API gravity says how light or heavy oil is. High API is lighter, low API is heavier. One isn’t necessarily better than the other, they have different uses. For example, heavy oil makes better fuel oil for ships. Sometimes oil can have high sulfur content, which is expensive but necessary to remove. “Sweet” oil means low sulfur content. WTI and Brent are light crudes, a lot of Middle Eastern, Canadian and Venezuelan oil (as examples) is heavy.

· Condensate and Natural Gas Liquids – C2-C5+ (ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, etc.) found in some gas fields. Exist as liquids at ambient temperatures and often more valuable than the gas itself.

· Gas – Natural gas, not gasoline. Most oil fields have associated gas production, which may be flared (burned off) or reinjected into the reservoir to enhance recovery (keeps pressures higher so production doesn’t decline as fast).

· LNG – Liquefied Natural Gas. If you’re exporting gas overseas and can't use a pipeline, you send it to a terminal that makes it really fucking cold to liquefy it and then send it to export markets by ship, where it is turned back into gas.

· OPEC and OPEC+ - You all should have heard of the OPEC cartel, but OPEC+ was a group of non-member countries (Russia chief among them) that worked with OPEC to protect oil prices by reducing their output. That ended early in March and led to the price war.

· NOCs – National Oil Companies. Most producing countries have a state-owned oil company that will typically control large portions of the country’s reserves or all of it; sometimes there are a few state-owned companies in one country. They’ll also partner in assets outside of their country. Saudi Aramco in Saudi Arabia, Rosneft and Gazprom in Russia, Petrobras in Brazil, ONGC in India, Equinor in Norway, etc. The US, obviously, does not have a NOC. Not all NOCs are created equal. Pemex, Mexico’s NOC, is a steaming pile of shit and the one of the most indebted companies in the world.

· Supermajors – There are five: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total. Huge, valuable companies that have been around forever and will probably be around until the Sun swallows the Earth or we all kill each other. Even after we transition away from hydrocarbons as our energy source, these behemoths will adapt and endure.

**Industry Background**

**TL;DR Very brief history, skip if you don’t care**

The oil and gas industry has always been more boom and bust than a lot of other sectors. The world wants exactly as much petroleum as it wants and not a drop more. When supply does not match demand, prices fluctuate widely. OPEC (essentially led by Saudi Arabia) was formed in 1960 and as of 2018, its 14 member countries control nearly half of global production and over three-quarters of proven reserves. Since the 1980s, the organization began setting production targets to protect oil prices and market share. This has led to a series of price wars, with the previous occurring in 2014-2016.

US oil production peaked in the 1970s and had been in steady decline until about 2009, when the shale revolution began. The early days were the wild west, with small independents springing up like weeds and spending years and billions focused on growth over returns. Oil output climbed to 8-9 MMbo/d in 2014 and was over 12 MMbo last year, making the US the largest producer in the world.

The price war in 2014 began when Saudi Arabia and OPEC moved to protect market share by allowing themselves to exceed their production quotas. The goal of the price war was to reign in US shale. US output fell from a peak of 9.5 MMbo/d to a low of 8.5 MMbo/d. However, companies were backstopped by an inflow of new capital from lenders, private equity and others under the promise of future returns. Oil prices dipped into the high $20/bbl range before the end of the war. The price war was ultimately abandoned by Saudi Arabia after King Salman was warned that the country would be bankrupt within three to four years if it continued and major economic reforms weren't implemented.

In the years since the 2014-2016 price war, consolidation has begun in the US shale patch. New capital is harder to come by and investors have shifted focus from continued growth to positive cash flow and returns. Smaller or over-levered companies have started folding or been bought out by larger, stronger competitors, including supermajors.

In order to curb oversupply issues and protect prices, OPEC+ (OPEC, Russia and ten other non-members) began curtailing production in 2017. Those original cuts have been extended and expanded multiple times, all the way through March 2020. The current cuts that expire Wednesday amount to 1.7 MMbo/d, or 2.1 MMbo/d when including voluntary reductions from Saudi Arabia.

**Demand Destruction: Who needs oil when you are knocking back a cold bottle of beer flu**

**TL;DR Oil demand could fall by 20 MMbo/d YOY at the peak. Bad for prices.**

Covid-19 threw a wrench into oil markets, which should be painfully obvious. Industrial production in China—one of Russia and Saudi Arabia’s primary customers—fell off a cliff. China is the largest energy consumer in the world and accounted for over 80% of global oil demand growth last year. Demand for transport fuels has also been pummeled with 3 billion people on lockdown and fewer goods moving around. As an example of how important that is, 70% of US petroleum consumption, or 14 MMbo/d, is used for transportation. Petroleum is also used for hundreds of intermediate and end-use products such as plastics, polyurethane and solvents, which aren't being made. Power generation is also important, but a fairly small slice of the pie, and I don’t have time to get into electrical grids, baseload power and everything else it involves.

In early March, the IEA estimated oil demand this year would fall by 90,000 bo/d from 2019 to a total of about 100 MMbo/d, compared to its previous estimate of 825,000 bo/d of growth. This forecast was based on an assumption of 2.5 MMbo/d less demand in Q1 with a gradual rebound the rest of the year. At the time, its best case scenario was that oil demand would grow by 480,000 bo/d. In the worst case, demand would fall by 730,000 bo/d.

This was pretty bad, but far too rosy an outlook. Since then, numerous analysts have projected declines in demand ranging from 7 to 10 MMbo in Q2. Goldman Sachs and Vitol (world’s largest independent oil trader) estimate oil demand could fall by 15-20 MMbo/d YOY at its peak. The IEA has since said much the same thing. Even if the price war ended tomorrow, it would be too late to avoid an oversupply issue, which I’ll talk about later.

**Price War: “Fuck US Shale” -Putin probably, but in Russian**

**TL;DR Saudi Arabia and Russia are fighting for market share, with the added benefit of knee-capping US Shale. Oversupply could be several million barrels per day. Both of them are equipped to draw this out. Even worse for prices.**

Saudi Arabia and OPEC knew how bad the pandemic was going to be for oil prices, so they sought to extend and expand production cuts again in late February and early March. The cuts would have taken another 1.5 MMbo/d off the markets through 2020, for a total of 3.6 MMbo/d. The proposal required the approval of OPEC+ (mainly Russia), as the non-members would have been responsible for 500,000 bo/d of the cuts.

Russia, as we all know, did not agree to the cuts. Their argument was that any production cuts were quickly replaced by growth in US shale oil production. Which is true, we’ve added about 3 MMbo/d in the three years that OPEC+ has cut production by, at most, 2.1 MMbo/d. There have been reports that new sanctions against Rosneft regarding commercial relations with Venezuela were what ultimately caused Putin to tell his energy minister to reject the cuts.

Saudi Arabia responded quickly. Russia rejected the deal on March 6, and by March 8 the Saudis cut their official selling prices and kicked off the war, leading to the March 9 oil route. In a bid to recover market share they lost in the previous war, Saudi Arabia cut prices for their flagship Arab Light crude by $8/bbl for northwest Europe in April—directly challenging Russia—setting a discount of $10.25/bbl under Brent, compared to a $2/bbl discount for Russia’s Urals blend. The Saudis also reduced their prices to Asia and the US by $6-7/bbl.

Beyond prices, Saudi Arabia promised to increase production to 10 MMbo/d from their current 9.7 MMbo/d, once the existing OPEC+ production cuts fell off on April 1. Since then, they have doubled down and said they would increase production to 12.3 MMbo/d and begin increasing capacity to 13 MMbo/d. Now, it is estimated that 12 MMbo/d is the Saudi’s current production capacity, meaning they would have to dip into their stored reserves and couldn’t maintain 12.3 forever.

The UAE, primarily Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC, said they would increase production by 1 MMbo/d. Russia promised to increase their production by 300,000 bo/d. The other 12 members of OPEC and 10 non-member countries of OPEC+ also have no reason to hold back anymore. This won’t happen overnight on April 1, but you still have promises to add something like 3.5-4 MMbo/d to a market that doesn’t need it, which is a nightmare in the best of times.

Unlike previous price wars, which were started by Saudi Arabia to protect market share, Russia started this one for geopolitical and economic reasons. Putin pulled the trigger, and he is obviously not some replaceable energy minister, so this will go on as long as he wants or until everyone else capitulates. Russia is also far less reliant on oil revenue than Saudi Arabia.

According to the IMF, Russia needs $42/bbl to balance its budget, compared to $82/bbl for the Saudis. Oil and gas revenue account for 1/3 of Russia’s budget and about half its exports, compared to 80% and 2/3 for Saudi Arabia. Russia has also said it could withstand $25-30/bbl for 6-10 years (remember SA ended the 2014-16 war because they were going to be bankrupt in 3-4). Saudi Arabia’s advantage is that they have the cheapest production costs in the world, at $2.80/bbl. Their budget requires $82/bbl because they are using the revenues to try to diversify their economy, which they can also put on the back burner.

To quote analyst Vincent Lauerman, “If oil consumption was to decline by a conservative 2.5 million bbls/d this year, oil production by Saudi Arabia, UAE and Russia was to increase by 2.57 million bbls/d on an annualized basis, and given the initial 1.65 million bbls/d surplus forecasted by OPEC, global oil supply would exceed consumption by an insane 7.88 million bbls/d in 2020. In the heart of the previous three oil price wars, global oil supply exceeded consumption by no more than 1.76 million bbls/d, in 1998.”

He went on to say that the surplus won’t be that high, for several reasons, which will be explained next. But it’s a good summation of how impactful a price war during a pandemic is.

**Impacts on Industry: We’re all fucked (by popular request)**

**TL;DR WTI oil prices could fall to $10/bbl or even single digits. Shale companies are fucked, OFS companies are fucked, downstream companies may be fucked. Midstream companies may actually be ok.**

The most obvious impact are oil prices. WTI briefly hit its lowest price since 2002 once already since March 9 and again today, when it fell below $20/bbl. WCS (Canadian benchmark) costs less to buy—about $8-9/bbl—than it does to ship it. I won’t spend much time on Canada, they’ve been fucked since 2016 as they don’t have enough takeaway capacity and too much regulatory uncertainty, and now they’re just a gaping, bloody mess. But the prices aren’t stopping here. With the massive oversupply that is coming and limited storage, many analysts are forecasting prices as low as $10/bbl or even single digits if the price war and pandemic are drawn out.

Several US shale basins were marginally economic to begin with (remember unconventional wells are expensive), and with prices falling so far they are entirely uneconomic. Almost every company, although not all of them, have cut capital expenditures (and sometimes dividends and executive/employee pay) to reduce their cash outflows. Remember, new capital saved shale in the last war, but it isn’t happening this time. Shale is no longer in the good graces of lenders it enjoyed in previous years.

The companies will be able to prop up production for a while with DUC inventories, which are wells that were drilled but uncompleted, meaning they can be brought on stream for relatively small amounts of capex. But eventually those will run out, and uneconomic production will be shut in regardless. Russia (Putin) is actually likely to get what they want, at least for a while, as independent producers in the US who don’t have the state backing of a NOC will let production decline to try to survive.

Many producers, including US shale companies, have been hedging their production in recent years to protect against low oil prices. Many of them also used three-way collars to do it. An example of a three-way collar would be buying a put at $45/bbl, then selling a call at $55/bbl and another put at $35/bbl to offset premiums. They’re fine between $45-$55—or whatever they expected oil's price range to be—and protected from $35-$45, but once it falls below that, the put they sold wipes out any gains from the one they bought and then some. Some, like Devon, used costless collars and swaps to hedge, so their positions will be fine (Devon’s position is worth about $800MM right now). And a few, like Continental, didn’t hedge at all, so they get to take $20 or $10/bbl right in the nuts.

Storage is also finite and quickly running out, which is and will further depress prices. The Texas Railroad Commission (regulates O&G in Texas) said some pipeline operators have issued warnings to producers to reduce production because storage is filling up. Midstream companies, I think, will actually weather this storm fairly well. Pipelines are typically anchored by long-term firm service (take-or-pay) contracts, and as storage becomes more scarce it becomes more expensive. Enbridge, a Canadian midstream company that is North America’s largest, has already said it is in a strong position to get through this.

Oilfield services companies are particularly vulnerable. Unlike producers and midstream companies, their product is their work. If they don’t have work, they don’t have cash flow, whereas the others can sit on their thumbs and the oil and gas provides cash flow. Halliburton has reduced hours for 3,500 employees in Houston, as an example. And Aker Solutions and some other OFS companies that operate in the North Sea have issued layoff warnings to all of their employees and sent foreign contractors home. Downstream companies are also being affected, as refineries are preparing for run cuts (falling demand, no one wants what they are selling) and slowing deliveries (they’re onsite storage is running out too).

Once all this blows over, oil and gas will recover. Again, it won’t be overnight. Production will have to be cut across the industry until demand recovers (probably next year will be ok). They will have to wait for storage levels to fall too before prices will recover fully. There will be bankruptcies during and a wave of consolidation after.

As an aside, the adminstration’s promise to buy 77 MMbo for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a crock of shit. The SPR is already 90% full, and 77 MMbo, if they can even buy that much, is a drop in the proverbial bucket. It would accomplish nothing and will not protect oil prices or US companies at all.

**So what do we do with this asshole?**

**TL;DR I don’t know. I’m a dumbass and I only know about oil and gas, but I can’t directly participate in energy markets. Figure it out for yourself.**

Again, I’m not doing DD for you on specific companies, that’s on you. As I said before, /u/fuzzyblankeet threads are a good place to start, and I did talk about Devon and Oxy a bit in his first thread. A lot of US shale companies have debt up to their eyeballs, much of it bad. I’m restricted by my company from participating directly in energy markets, so I haven’t looked as closely at companies as I have in other sectors, other than for those I’m writing about for work (and 75% of what I write is focused specifically on E&P operations).

It should already be priced in, but I think there may be some more movement on April 1 when the OPEC+ cuts fall off and a deal hasn’t been reached (they aren’t even talking, it’s not going to happen). Saudi Arabia can turn on the taps quickly from 9.7 MMbo/d, as their current production capacity is estimated at 12 MMbo/d, but by and large the increases in output will take weeks or months to materialize. This will be offset to some extent by falling production among independent producers all over the world, but it won’t be enough.

Upstream US company stocks are sure to go lower, especially if WTI goes to $10/bbl or below, and some of them will go bankrupt. Might be a good opportunity to buy in for them sweet dividends (when they come back), but also carries a risk.

**Fundamentals**

Summary

* Mariott owns a variety of hotels going from residence inn to the Ritz-Carlton. Obviously diversified in their industry, but hey guess what, If hotels aren't the best places to catch  🍺 🦠 I don't know what is.
* They've been victim of a data breach incident, no one really cares but hey, its in there.
* They have 2144 properties, a total of 585K rooms and some of these are under lease agreements, they also manage some home and condo communities. Most likely this segment is less exposed than the rest.
* These fuckers also receive royalties from a Timeshare corporation that they spun off, so whenever you get harassed by timeshares, think that the fuckers from Mariott are also behind it, they really do dip their toes in everything.
* They are not greatly dependent on seasonality, mostly because they are fully diversified and do not only procure hotel for vacationing but mostly also for business, this is great in normal situation, but with the  🍺 🦠 you can expect business travel to be the most affected. Companies might never go back to the level of business travel that they had before now that they can taste the sweet economies of $ZM, $MSFT, or $CSCO meetings.
* 66% of their Revenues are from North America, I would assume mostly USA since Canada really is a crappy country to visit, even for business, I know I live there. According to them they have 16 percent share of the US market.
* They have roughly 174K employees, with roughly 22K who are unionized, this is good means they don't have to deal with the load of bullshit union agreements that create problems when trying to fire employees, which means they have some room to reduce operating cost.
* Really interesting bit of information: ""I*n addition, U.S. government travel and travel associated with U.S. government operations are a significant part of our business, which can suffer due to U.S. federal spending cuts, government hiring restrictions, or other spending limitations that may result from presidential or congressional action or inaction, including for example, a U.S. federal government shutdown, such as the partial shutdown that occurred in December 2018 and January 2019.""* **Normally, when companies have to identify that they have risk and uncertainties and exposure to specific industries, it means it could significantly impact Revenue. Hint hint.**

&#x200B;

>This is turning into much more of a fundamental analysis than I want, this is suppose to be about indebtedness god dammit, but that last thing i'll say is the following. **Remember how I said that North America was roughly 66% of their Revenue? Well they are expecting to grow their business based on their international business, it isn't impossible that other countries are less lenient than the USA following this crisis, which could add rules surrounding the industry, further impeding their chance of growing their company.**

&#x200B;

**Key financials**

* Occupancy is at roughly 70% across the board
* North America has highest Average daily rates

**Revenues**

* $3,7M of Net fee Revenue in 2019, up 5% from 2018
* $1,6M of Owned leased and other Revenue (prety much garbage bin of Revenue)
* Theres this whole thing about Cost of Reimbursements Revenue, its not important its mostly bullshit and its a non cash item, *for you autist non cash in income statement =* ***some accountant is having an orgasm but you don't care***\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**EBIT**

* They generated 1,8M of EBIT in 2019, and $2,3M of EBIT in 2018.

>Yeah I know, you just learned about EBITDA and now I'm talking about EBIT, in real estate industries or hotel industries for that matter, some accountant decided it was meaningful to add depreciation and amortization to the main income measure, considering its predominantly real estate, so its non cash but actually important, the opposite of what I said of the other elements, sue me.

&#x200B;

**Fundamental summary**

Overall what does this tell us? Mariott has healthy margin, especially considering they are in the hotel industry, you can really tell they are screwing their clients and you can understand why AIRBNB was allowed to exist. Goddamn 30% EBIT from 5.1B in the real estate business, thats more than your ISP makes off of your internet connection god damnit.  So even though Hotels are a killer hard industry... Hotels man... Mariott is as solid as it gets.

They are facing serious pressure though for the future considering Revenues are about to shoot down significantly, expenses can't be completely mitigated as some of it is amortization (non cash can't do anything going to hit your P&L what ever you do except if you sell it, but who buys fucking hotels...), but they should be able to reduce their operating expenses temporarily by shutting down services to customers etc...

**$MAR Debt (The boring part)**

Before I get started, I really have nothing to say but I'm already fucking tired of doing this analysis, I have the attention span of a hamster and I'm only thinking about when I'll be able to go out of the home and exercise, I also don't know why I chose to do this instead of playing video games, but w/e.

So listen to fuzzy, Ctrl+F credit agreement in the 10K, and the first thing you find is note 9. The long-term debts. Now I know we are looking for short term debts, but short term portions of long term debt agreements are usually included in this section.

Well you can already close your computer and stop this analysis, because they issued a bunch of Senior notes and its fucking a load of crap to deal with, so take that drink and slam it onto your face.

&#x200B;

# Senior notes

I'll already say I'm sorry, I'm going to keep this portion really simple, not because of the people reading, but because I got no fucking clue how to properly analyze those senior notes, where to go to find the underlying agreements, and I just don't really care enough to do it because I can already draw a conclusion from this analysis, and its that the indebtedness portion of it is fucking useless, this company is so goddamn solid.

Anyway, lets look at the interest rates, they all vary greatly so its hard to paint a clear picture without doing a very large deep dive, it looks like they also practice SWAP on interest rates to transform fixed rates into variable rates. I know its fucking complicated. Essentially they obtain Fix rates Senior debts then they find someone thats willing to take that fixed interest rates, pay them that amount, while $MAR has to pay the variable rate agreed to, usualy LIBOR + Something, in this case there is an example of LIBOR + 0,754. That's going to be prety good when interest rates go to 0. Cheap credit!

&#x200B;

So looking at Senior notes, they make things easy for you autists by combining the principal reimbursements Only $977M is due in 2020, and $1,1B in 2021. That really isn't bad we are talking roughly $2B of cash outflow obligation or refinancing obligation in 2020 and 2021.

Like I said, we could continue for hours and analyse all senior notes, but I don't think its relevant for drawing a conclusion, please roast me if I'm wrong /u/fuzzyblankeet

# Commercial papers

Oh god damnit, its not enough they have fucking Notes, they also have goddamn Commercial papers, help me..... Oh but lordy lord this is where we actually find meat on the bone. Let me quote this right out of the 10K because its too goddamn juicy.

*"" As discussed in Note 9, even though our commercial paper borrowings generally have short-term maturities of 30 days or less, we classify outstanding commercial paper borrowings as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis ""*

So what does this mean? Well essentially $MAR has a rolling credit card on top of their Revolver that was at $3,2B by the end of 2019 this Credit card is **owed 30 days after issuance in average, but because accountants are moron they let Mariott classify this as long term, because they can refinance it easily. Well not anymore baby.** The carrying amount from 2018 was $2,2B which means they had to increase this by $1B for 2019 activities.

Lets try to find more information on these beautiful things. I dint find much to be honest, but based on their definition and what they do with the Commercial paper it is clear that **they rely on their Clint Eastwood gun to cover for these Commercial papers if they can't refinance**. So lets assume their balance was $3,2B by the end of Q1 for the sake of simplicity, and lets apply that balance to our other line of credit.

&#x200B;

# Revolver

Hey, Mariott also have a pistol, their pistol is quite more significant than the one from $SEA though, their Pistol is for **$4.5B**. They have drawn absolutely 0$ from their pistol, but remember shit we said about the commercial papers? Thats right, we have to assume that they actually drew $3,2B from their weapon. 4.5B doesn't look like alot anymore, but surely they can refinance their obligations in other ways right?

LETS SEE!

**Negative covenant!**

/u/fuzzyblankeet send help

I guess the most important is the only thing they can secure for financing is a total $750M Additional to the carabine of $4,2B.

The other important thing is although the main way to get credit for you mere mortal is to get a mortgage on your house, it looks like this credit agreement is essentialy saying they can't get a mortgage on anything, not even on the plants outside their properties.

All other negative covenants are essentialy saying that they can't get cash out of the company, merge, unmerge, selloff, etc.... can't sell major portion of their business etc.... Essentialy yeah like they can'T do anything.

Honestly at this point I really just want to shoot myself, these goddamn Negative covenant terms essentially say they can't do anything but also I don't know what they can actually do because who the fuck knows what this is saying. /u/fuzzyblankeet you can definitely roast me on this one.

**Affirmative covenants**

The only important covenant that I see there is that they have to maintain a leverage ratio no greater than 4 to 1. Within the agreement here is how they define the ""leverage ratio"" Adjusted debt / consolidated EBITDA. Great we have the calculation right? WRong... this is a fucking legal document remember, we need to know how to calculate the adjusted debt.

I won't paste the whole thing in here but essential here is how you calculate adjusted debt based on their agreement

1. Total of debt for borrowed money (Everything owned basically, notes and all) **+**
2. Guarantees exceeding $500M (So total guarantees - $500M) **FUCK MORE WORK**
3. Net cash proceeds when they purchase something material (understand here materiality in the sense of something important), so this really isn't that important **I don't think they have anything in there, if they do well fuck me**

Great, so we are done right, well kindof we have to calculate that goddamn shit. First off is the consolidated EBITDA, yeah cause, who the fuck doesn't use EBIT when they report on it, lets add Depreciation and amortization.

Consolidated is EBITDA for 2019 is **2,1B.** Just trust me this post is already long enough.

Adjusted debt is (back to note 9, **also fuck my life.**)

1. $10,9B
2. 0. Looks like they have $354M of Gurantees, so we are in the clear for this
3. 0. **I'll just assume this is 0 because fuck that.**

So based on this, their Leverage Ratio is ""drum roll"", 5.19

>**ERM Yeah... They were sitting at 3,72 in 2018, and somewhere in 2019 they blew over the requirement of 4 to 1 what does this mean??? Well remember our $3.2B of amazing commercial paper, + the repayment of $977M in 2020? Well the bank syndicate could refuse to give them the money based on the breach of their affirmative convenant**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

**$MAR** need to find roughly $4,2B in 2020, with potentially more cash outflow than cash inflow. Let's say occupancy is at roughly 30% for 6 months, this would drive their revenue down by \~60%, which means they would be down from $5,3B to $2,12B.

With outstanding efforts, lets say they can reduce their operating cost by roughly 50% (optimistic), this would bring their total cost of operating down by $1B, so their total impact on operating income would be -$2B out of their $2,1B of EBITDA. Which means they would be generating roughly $250M of EBITDA per yeat. Ouch... They won't be getting cash that way.

So I think its safe to say we can short $MAR to oblivion? Yeah no, not so fast. This industry WILL get bailed out by the government, there is so much real estate associated with it, surely there is still alot of value in this buisiness, who knows what the impact on equity will be from this bailout. I'll let you draw your own conclusion as to what the moves you need to do for this are, but by the looks of this they are in dire need of short term cash to repay their obligations.

&#x200B;

/u/fuzzyblankeet please don't hesitate to say how much of a retard I am and how I got everything wrong, I have a feeling my Adjusted debt calculation is wrong, but I've revisited it so much + the fact that 2018 was actually below 4 to 1 gives me confidence.

&#x200B;

Let me know :)

&#x200B;

**TL/DR;** MAR will struggle to repay their short term obligation unless they go through a new financing agreement / bailout.

**HISTORY**

People always gonna need gas. And with Trump we all know what we're gonna get. This man is chain-sucking authoritarian PP all 'round the world, and what two authoritarian nations are in the oil price war? Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Now I don't know about you guys, but Trump has TREMENDOUS calls with Putin. The greatest calls. And don't you remember the  meeting in Saudi Arabia? He [touched the goddamn globe, people.](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/world/23orb/23orb-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp)

Now if there's one thing I have to give the man credit for, it's making deals ^disregard ^the ^iran ^deal and making the market bullish as fuck as long as he's not pressed on anything by a reporter (and even this shit would still moon)

Not only is he gonna save oil, you know damn well he'll give bailouts and more subsidies if he has to. The man hasn't just deregulated them, he's fucking empowered them with government positions. And you know damn well know that subsidies won't have any issue passing Congress.

I've spoken enough on the history of this gay price war and I know you were all expecting positions by now, and to you I say go look up top you fucking retard

Fuck USO. Fuck this stupid ETF, we're gonna go with a midstream petroleum company. Now I know nothing about the oil industry so you know you can trust my DD. But I read somewhere on this subreddit that midstreams will probably be fine through this whole thing. We're goin' with $DCP.

**DCP Midstream Partners**

Now I'm gonna go into the details but the TL;DR of this section is that DCP is expected to go to $13, it's estimated to be oversold after the oil price war was priced in, and the company is in a very good spot to get through this crisis as they don't have any debt due until September. They've also made strides to save money.

Not only that, but [here's a goddamn all-time chart](https://i.imgur.com/Zwp98IP.png) to show you exactly what happened every time it crashed hard. THIS IS THE FUCKING DIP. This shit always recovered pretty well within three months of the bottom.

Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (which is some technical shit I'll only listen to if it aligns with the positions in my RH account and preconceived notions about the world and my understanding of the market) is [TWENTY](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dcp-midstream-enters-oversold-territory-150503051.html). If it's below 30 it's in oversold territory. Now that's a pretty big fucking gap and signals to me to buy calls.

Not only that, [the company has taken steps to cut costs and pay debt.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4334931-dcp-midstream-partners-significantly-undervalued-investors-panic) No debt is due until September 21, and the extra money in their budget can enable them to ride out this wave in relative comfort.

**CONCLUSION**

So what should you buy? Well, unfortunately politics takes time and the price won't just suddenly shoot up to $20 in a week. Personally, [I bought 23 7/17 5c contracts and 5 10/16 5c contracts](https://i.imgur.com/scijn6Q.png). If you're feeling like that's some pussy shit and you're extra retarded, I invite you to buy contracts expiring 4/17 or 5/15 but I'm 90% sure they won't go anywhere.

Still bearish as fuck about the market right now but I think this has hit its bottom and I'm anticipating it to go up as we move through the recession.

Once more for those who have bad eyesight:

**$DCP $5c 10/16 or 7/17**

EDIT: I've read your comments, I've seen a lot of sense being made, and it's clear I'm going against the sentiment of WSB. Which means I'm inversing the subreddit properly and therefore my calls will print baby! Thank you all for your words!

Last time they were this low they bounced hard.  I think NRZ is one of the better ones and they’re taking steps to secure their future.  NRZ hit $4.61 on March 18th.  It bounced up to $8.91 by March 20th.  That’s a 93.28% gain.  It hit $4.57 on March 24th.  It bounced to $7.89 by March 26th.  That’s a 72.65% gain.  Right now it's $4.36.  Where will it be in two days?  Even if it only bounces 50% that’s $6.55.  Calls for 4/17 are dirt cheap right now as the stock is at an all-time low, and, unlike a lot of others, it has decent volume.  

Some other info from Seeking Alpha – 

> Updating his estimates to reflect the times and the latest information disclosed by New Residential (NYSE:NRZ), BTIG bull Giuliano Bologna cuts his price target to $10.50 from $18. That's still way more than a double from the current $4.33 (down another 13.7% today).

> Bologna does expect increasing dividends following this quarter's $0.05. He sees $0.10 in Q3 and $0.20 in Q4. In 2021, He expects $0.25 per quarter, well below his full-year operating earnings estimate of $1.42.

> Bologna takes note of NRZ's ""differentiation"" to other mREITs, particularly exposure to businesses able to generate counter-cyclical, capital-light earnings.

Of course past performance doesn't ensure future results.  We're staring down the barrel of a major bear market.  I'm 95% in puts myself.  I just think there's money to be made here.  I made the same play last time they dipped and it printed.  Hoping to ride the wave again.

Two swap lines later and all i think we had here was a dead cat bounce. Dollars are now the cheapest to borrow in history in Europe and yet no one wants them. Ecuador traded 300 million in gold for dollars. Let that sink all you peter Schiff followers (I detest that fucking guy he’s a charlatan in the financial markets). The second swap line was setup for the boj because the dollar is in such demand people would rather use jgbs to swap for dollars then the bojs qe. I think these ivory tower prince and princess created such a convoluted mess for themselves by just piling on debt for the last decade and they have no idea how to fix it. 
     Right now the euro sits at 1.09 the 20 year trendline is around 1.085 and there’s nothing but air under 1.10. At some point as the dollar keeps going this month the fed is just going to step in and hammer it because they’re out of ideas. Goldman thinks it happens 5% above the highs and honestly I’m atleast taking out my initial bet maybe more there because I have a feeling theyre right. Both swap lines were setup for 6 months so I don’t think this dollar situation is over for the year but I do think this is going to be an ugly month. Will the ecb act maybe after April 17th when they get trade surplus data and the ivory tower princess sees just what a big problem she has on her hands.

Two days later the US government finally confirmed a grave picture that I have modeled.

However, no one is talking about the tail-end of the infection curve, which will take additional months to unravel (in either scenario):

**Negative Scenario**

Even if we peak in amount of infections sometime in April (quite a stretch), the right side of the curve will easily take us into Aug/Sep before we can even start thinking about selective opening of some retail locations and offices. 

Furthermore, in order to get people safely back to work, all the US citizens of working age would have to be tested first (about 210M people x 2 tests). Only the ones that had the virus and are no longer infectious can go to their workplace. Also, only the people that are immune can visit those workplaces. Everyone else would still have to be quarantined until it is completely safe. 

The only way to curtail this “leaky” curve tail-end is to institute a near-complete lockdown for at least a month. Anything short of that will certainly create a second wave of infections.

TL;DR

Mix-in mid and long-term puts with your short-term puts. Look into puts for Jul/Aug/Sep and later. Can’t reopen the US economy in any capacity or any state, until the infection curve is below a certain threshold - many months away.",2020-04-01 21:46:12

US wants low-cost unmanned air craft capable of overwhelming near-peer air defenses by sheer numbers.

There are other options like $LMT and $NOC, congratulations on you’re big dick if that is what you can afford. But I’ve found a position even a cuck like me can enter.

DD,Impact on the Hotel Industry,42,ft3wks,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft3wks/impact_on_the_hotel_industry/,32,1585790063.0,"Hey there retards. Since I'm one of the only idiots on here with a real job, I figured I'd share some of industry data with you all so we can have some real DD in here. I'm in hotel development so most of my information will showcase near-term and speculative long-term impacts on the hotel industry and real estate capital markets. 

Early data from the China Hotel market provided a glimpse into the potential impact that bat virus would have on hotel markets around the world. By mid-January, roughly 30 days after the initial viral outbreak in Wuhan, the China hotel market was operating at approximately 70% occupancy. Within two weeks, domestic and international travel restrictions and a growing international awareness to the potential damage of COVID-19 had decimated the hotel market. Reports gathered on January 26 showcased a 75% drop in occupancy to 17% for the period. 

Fast-forward to March 30 and we’re able to more accurately quantify the impact beer flu is having on the US hotel market. STR’s most recent release on March 25, 20201 provides a glimpse at the initial damage done to the markets:  

* Occupancy down -56.4% to 30.3%, 
* Average Daily Rate down -30.2% to US$93.41, and 
* RevPAR down -69.5% to US$28.32.  

To put this in perspective, the declines are worse than both 9/11 and the financial crisis of 2007–08. 

Now here's where things get really fucking interesting. According to Trepp LLC, the U.S. Hotel industry held approximately $300B of mortgage debt as of third quarter 2019. This was up 7.8% from a year earlier and 14.2% from two years earlier. While most hotels have operating reserves to last multiple months of revenue decline, very few are capitalized to survive multiple consecutive months at zero or near-zero revenue. While state and federal disaster relief programs may extend this runway, timing for relief capital injection and duration of closure have the potential to tip the scales towards cascading defaults throughout the markets. And with current delinquent trends (1.33% of hotel loans being delinquent as of Q3 2019), this thing is about to  blow like your mom at the corner truck stop now that she's lost her geriatric travel agency job. 

And as a popped cherry on top, the latest industry estimate is $5-8 trillion total loss for Q1-Q3 2020. ONE FUCKING INDUSTRY.

DD,DD from the world of fixed income,284,ft3m52,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft3m52/dd_from_the_world_of_fixed_income/,113,1585789187.0,"Got some insider insight from the world of fixed income and, because I’m feeling generous, I’d thought I’d share it with with you greedy bastards.

For the uninitiated out there, fixed income = smart money ... The truly wealthy people and large institutions of the world are all about fixed income. Rich people especially love things like municipal bonds and such for their federal tax advantages. Keep this in mind below:

According to my friend who works the fixed income trading desk at one of the largest brokerage firms, short term treasuries went negative for a brief time this morning. In fact, said firm had to close {{3}} of their money market funds to new investors today to protect existing customers from negative yields. In layman’s terms, so much money was thrown at money market instruments from big players today that prices went up for treasuries so high that yields went negative. In response, they shut down their money market mutual funds to avoid having to buy more treasuries pushing yields even lower.

Where was this influx of money coming from, you ask? The rich are rotating out of municipal bonds into money market instruments. That’s HUGE. Think about it: You know it’s bad when the ultra wealthy are voluntarily asking to pay higher taxes and accept lower yields (which they would by moving their wealth from muni’s into US treasuries).

*My personal thoughts:*

The implication? “Smart Money” thinks city and state governments aren’t going to be able to pay  on their bonds. Why wouldn’t cities and states be able to meet their debt obligations? There’s no tax revenue. Why is there no tax revenue? Because their residents aren’t going to be working and there ain’t no business/commerce that’s gonna be conducted anytime soon.

Tldr; Puts [on whatever suits your fancy].

[Edit: I am NOT suggesting puts on municipal bond funds. I AM suggesting smart money knows that the overall economic situation is more dire than the stock market would suggest, and is positioning itself accordingly. The fools of r/Investing say we’re at the bottom and everyone should DCA their paychecks into the stock market. In contrast, “smart money” is saying commerce is going to be shut down for a while. If that’s the case, how can you look at current valuations with a straight face? Current stock market is OVER priced. Ergo, short the market.]",2020-04-01 20:59:47

I’m here today to share some autism distilled into its weaponized form using the book of matches that /u/fuzzyblankeet so considerately (or negligently) left out for us to play with.

Before you go any further, you should understand that /u/krusteeblanket is **not** an SEC lawyer, and has less than a complete high school education. This is not investment advice; my advice is that you invest in something nice for your wife to wear for her boyfriend and quit throwing away your money trying to guess what jnug and spy will do the next day.

Without further ado, let’s talk about how to pick the bones of the soon-to-be roadkill that is Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI).

Okay, a little more ado… before we start, you should read the [10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1534992/000153499220000019/frgi-2019q410k.htm) so that you can do this shit yourselves instead of relying on janitors such as yours truly:

**1.** **The beer flu is bad for restaurants, the FED is bad for puts. No shit. Everyone knows.**

So you are probably asking yourself, what should I do for those sweet, sweet tendies? Why not some puts? Let’s consider what happens when a business goes under [but you have puts.](https://www.optionsanimal.com/what-happens-value-option-when-company-declares-bankruptcy/)

Short story shorter, you profit, and someone else holds the bag. Wouldn’t that be nice for once?

Keep that in mind.

Now, our next question…. What businesses might be disproportionately affected by this whole bat munching thing? Restaurants! Good answer turds. Not all restaurants are created equal though. Some are drowning in cash and good credit. Others, not so much. On top of that, this bail out is designed to help our huge corporate overlords, and small businesses will keep having their American dreams cucked. Don’t buy puts on BK (QSR). They have tons of debt, but they aren’t going anywhere, so it’s just like buying a lotto ticket.

Some of you autists have been banging your head against the walls wondering why certain stocks keep climbing when as all the boomers and sick people are dying off. 

[It’s because this virus and this bailout are going to suffocate big business’ mom-and-pop (and small cap) competition, not (most) big boys.](https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/the-rise-in-the-sp-500-isnt-what-you-think-it-is-20200331)

Yeah it’s sad and all, but this is capitalism and that means that the silver lining is always a potential profit opportunity. Enter FRGI. I’ll give you a hint up front, their credit sucks and they aren’t getting a bail out.

**2.** **RTF10-K (Read the F… 10-K)**

If you were a sports gambler, you’d probably make it your business to know who you were betting for and against. As our dear dad Fuzzy pointed out, the SEC makes it super easy for us. Read it. I’ll wait.

Now that you’ve done that, you’ve used your big brain and determined the following:

· They operate in Texas and Florida (hint: Florida is fuk)

· They have two chains – Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana, have you heard of them? No?

· About half their sales in 2019 occurred in the drivethrough

In the risks they list for their business they include:

· ***If a significant disruption in service or supply by any of our suppliers or distributors were to occur, it could create disruptions in the operations of our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.”***

· ***“Economic downturns may adversely impact consumer spending patterns.”***

· ***“Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.”***

· ***Despite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur more debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.***

So, what happens when you have a lot of debt, and way less customers than your thought? What happens you’re your debt is such that you have to put in your 10-K that you probably can’t take on more debt, but if you did it would be an even greater risk… Oh, I forgot to mention, you also have leases you are obligated to pay in addition to your debt. Also, read that last bullet point above one more time.

· ***We are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing property subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.***

That’s right – they have 306 restaurants, 294 of which are leased. These leases are typically **35 to 45 years**. Wow. They can probably sublet if things get bad. Not like commercial real estate is gonna be rough right now.

**3.** **Let’s get into the financials**

There is a whole bunch of negative stuff I’m going to gloss over since the stock has already taken several hits. If you are interested it’s all in the… you guessed it… 10-K! There is a new 8-K that pulls their earnings too for all your nerds out there. Go back and read the 10k. I know you lied about reading it earlier. If you have questions ask /u/fuzzyblankeet. I think he costs 1.5k an hour, but he’s a good dad and he might not charge you. Maybe you can mow his lawn instead.

So... By their financials, I mean debt and liabilities –

Within the year they need to pay 49,335,000.

Within the next 3 years they need to pay an additional 166,222,000.

If you haven’t read fuzzy’s posts yet shame on you. Go do it now. And buy him 6 beers. And a lap dance.

Now that you’ve read them, you are familiar with the shady concept of EBITDA. Whenever companies use it, they have to state upfront that it is a way of calculating that does not conform to “generally accepted accounting practices”. That is corporate-speak for “shady”.

Their EBITDA in 2019 was 58,000,000.

**4.** **Big brain time**

There are better ways to do this analysis, but like I said, I’m just a janitor. If you could afford an SEC lawyer, you wouldn’t be using RH and shitposting on WSB. Not saying doing it the right way would be wasted on you, but I’ve got other stuff I’ve gotta mop tonight.

Since EBITDA is the weird hot dog meat of finance, let’s look at sales in 2019. 658,263,000. Not bad. Yet they reported (84,386) for income. () means it’s negative. They made negative money. Told you EBITDA was shady. To see how they might be doing now, let’s hypothetically say that they only keep their drive-thru sales because of the beer flu. That’s like 330,000,000. Now let’s say they don’t pay half their workers. That takes their operating expenses down from 732,088,000 to about 640,000,000.

330,000,000 - 640,000,000 = (310,000,000)… uh oh. That’s worse than their EBITDA. They say that their net cash in 2019 was like 65,000,000… not like they need to use that for payroll or food or cups or anything… It’s not like they have all that debt to pay.

Remember, this is a quick and nasty estimation and should not be interpreted as anything but. They surely have other ways to cut costs.

**5.** **So, they are gonna need more debt to pay their debt.**

Looks like before this beerflu kicked off, they had about 71.3 million left on their credit line (150 mil). Remember how much their contractual obligations were this next year, and then the 3 years thereafter. Ever hear of a term called a “debt wall”?

If you look at their [credit agreement,](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534992/000119380517003547/e617524_ex10-1.htm) you’ll see that they are charged more when their leverage goes up. You’ll also see that their leverage is restricted to a maximum of 4.5 times their EBIDTA (based on a complicated formula in the credit agreement). You’ll also see that they are not allowed to incur any debt with anyone else.

Remember negative covenants? Buckle up.

**6.** **Putting it all together.**

If debt goes up and EBITDA goes down with sales, the leverage ratio goes up. How high? It depends. If they don’t even have enough cash to service their debt this year without dipping into credit, what happens next? Long story short, it is not good, and there aren’t a whole lot of good options left, thanks to the negative covenants. RIP – (**F) RGI**

Since this is janitorial services, I’ll leave it here. Remember this is all probably garbage since /u/krusteeblanket is just the nasty thing under your bed that you hope your mom never finds, basically the opposite of fuzzyblankeet, who is expensive and actually keeps your mom warm at night.

DD,Oil Will Make New Lows,103,fu16wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu16wp/oil_will_make_new_lows/,61,1585914809.0,"Early this morning Donald Trump tweeted that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in talks about a production cut as high as 15mn bpd, which led oil prices to surge 25% today. As it turns out, this was a lie.  Dmitry Peskov, spokesman of Vladimir Putin, told the press that ‘’No one has launched any talks about a potential new oil-production deal to replace the OPEC+ format.’’ 

However, later this morning Saudia Arabia called for an urgent OPEC meeting to seek a fair agreement among OPEC members and other non-member nations.  The Saudis have stated they would be willing to reduce output to 9 million bpd, roughly what it produced in February before the OPEC+ deal fell apart, but only under the condition Moscow agrees to a 500,000 bpd production reduction which it rejected at the previous meeting. Even if this agreement was reached, which it won't be, it would only cut production by 3.5 mn bpd. Later in the day Russian Energy Minister Novak signaled that Russia, instead of cutting supply, will wait for demand to return. This clearly indicates they are still not open to agreement. And it makes sense, they have no reason to. Both nations have massive cash reserves and are willing to engage in a protracted price war to destroy the long-term threat that US shale poses.

Even if a sweeping agreement were to be reached between OPEC and non-OPEC states (other than the US) to cut production, it simply wouldn't be enough to counter the demand plummeting. The only solution here would be for US producers to agree on production cuts, but large producers such as Exxon and Chevron remain opposed, as do industry organizations. Inventories will continue to surge.

Global oil storage will be hitting its maximum capacity by mid-May as well, which will inevitably lead to massive downward pressure on prices. Landlocked and land-based oil producers, which are already selling at a loss, will run out of oil storage and will be forced to pay someone to take their excess oil until they shut down production. This has already led to negative prices in some areas. Ports and refineries are now turning down tankers at this point because the supply glut is so enormous.

Because of the massive oversupply, plummeting demand, and the unlikelihood of a multi-lateral supply cut agreement taking place (not that it would help much if it did), I believe oil will make new lows in the next three months. If I am wrong you may ban me.

There has only been one calendar day in which SPY did not touch 240 or above at least once.

On that day (Monday March 23) the highest price was 238.90.

The low was 217.75 almost immediately as Sunday March 22 futures opened.

Check your puts. Were they the most expensive on the ONLY calendar day where Spy didn’t make it above 240 AND hit the current low of the crash?

Strangely enough, all the puts I’ve tracked peaked 3 trading days BEFORE the bottom. On 3/18 SPY peaked at ~248 and bottomed at ~228, a $20 intraday drill. On March 18, put prices peaked up to 40% above the prices they traded for on “New black Monday” or whatever we’re calling it.

This fact alone is enough to scare the puts out of me (and yes I’m jacked to the tits in them). However there is even more bad news for my bear brethren...

Aside from one “session” we’ve held 240 support for 15 straight trading days. We finally bounced off 240 7 trading days ago and we’ve still yet to retest it even once.

We are definitely heading back down for another test this week. But what evidence do you see that we can consistently break below this behemoth of support??

I hate “priced in gang” with a passion. But at this point, bears are in serious need of absolutely terrible and unexpected news to break this support and crash hard enough to get comparable put gains to the previous leg down.

See the bottom of the page:

&#x200B;

> ***Expect Delays in Payment of UI Benefits to Workers.***  Under normal economic conditions, EDD typically issues a worker their  first week of benefits within 21 days of receiving a worker’s  application about 80 percent of the time. Given the extraordinary number  of applications received recently, as well as the expectation that  claims will continue to increase over the coming weeks, the Legislature  should anticipate that the first week of benefit payments will take much  longer than 21 days. Similar delays occurred during the Great  Recession. On March 24, the state Labor and Workforce Development Agency  [directed](https://www.labor.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-20-JS-letter-to-SH-re-UI-_-final-signed.pdf)  EDD to begin immediately paying claims for UI benefits prior to making a  final eligibility determination. A similar directive was issued during  the Great Recession and helped to ease, but not eliminate, payment  delays. 

&#x200B;

California EDD's claim handling infrastructure is built with gum and paperclips and they know it. They could barely handle the existing number of claims they had *before* this shitstorm happened. The 90s-era systems are totally overwhelmed by the number of applicants.

This is just in CA. I'm sure most states are in similar situations.

A lot of people applying for unemployment aren't going to see their money as soon as they'd hoped. People trying to survive on meager savings = consumer demand will collapse even harder than it already has. I expect to hear about a small wave of late mortgages / rents / car payments this month and then a fucking tsunami of delinquencies in May that won't ease up until state unemployment insurance finally starts catching up.

TL:DR - huge chunks of the population are going to miss payments because most people have like $3 in savings, consumer demand will collapse and banks will get fucked by delinquencies.

&#x200B;

Earnings are AH April 2nd (that is today).

This stock traded as low as $4 two weeks ago before they poison pilled so those $6p that you can pick up for like $40/contract had an intrinsic value of $200. Obviously since we are all retards here I should remind you that that past performance future performance blah blah blah.

First: Poison Pill [(Form 8-K)](http://ir.daveandbusters.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001104659-20-035620) All you really need to know about this is that it effectively prevents takeovers/acquisitions. Why is this important? Because, even though most M&A activity is suspended currently, acquisitions usually mean an immediate 25% - 40% premium to whatever the current trading price is. No risk of acquisitions means this company may be long term (like 3+ months out) screwed.

&#x200B;

Now on to the [10-Q](http://ir.daveandbusters.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-q/0001193125-19-310318) (for the stoolies out there: This is like a 10-K, but filed Quarterly)

The 10-Q is from last December and presents the company as they were on November 2nd.

&#x200B;

**Lets look quickly over some fun facts:**

PLAY had \~20mm cash on hand last November.

They had 32mm in inventories.

They also had drawn down on their revolver to 82% utilized. (656mm out of 800mm)

They have a few location openings this year (expected first half 2020) that they will have to take possession and have lease obligations on (which are noted that some of these upcoming obligations were left out of this 10-Q as they had not yet, last December, taken possession of the properties).

&#x200B;

**Leases and other Liabilities:**

What we know about their leases of which they had accrued liabilities of 44.6mm in November, is found in page 13:

>We currently lease the building or site for our stores, corporate office and warehouse space under facility operating leases. **These leases typically have initial terms ranging from ten to twenty years** and include one or more options to renew. When determining the lease term, we include option periods for which renewal is reasonably certain. **Most of the leases require us to pay property taxes, insurance and maintenance of the leased assets.**

What does this mean? It means that PLAY had as at last November **twice as much accrued lease liabilities** (rent it had incurred, but still needs to pay) as it had cash on hand.

What else can we learn about PLAY's leases?

Ending November 3rd PLAY had lease expenses of 31.5mm for the quarter and 91.7mm for the 39 weeks ending November 3rd.

This means PLAY has lease expenses of roughly 10mm per month.

Now all this is great, but why are you telling us Johnny?

Well because you may have heard that you should be staying the F\*K INSIDE! Which means....Dave & Busters isn't getting any of that sweet sweet cash you have saved up!

What else do we know about PLAY?

Well, they have been trying to grow themselves out of decreased revenues. How does this work?

New locations have honeymoon cash flows. Old locations generally have 2.5% to 4% decrease in revenues for every year they are open. So PLAY was opening a bunch of new locations first half 2020 which they had taken possession of along with other locations they had not yet taken possession of.

So they open new locations in an effort to show ""growth"" and cover the declining revenues from older locations. Unfortunately, this means that PLAY also incurs pre-opening costs of roughly 4mm/qtr as they open all these new locations.

To do this they, like many other companies as (and please critique me on my retarded reading skills of financial statements) the blanketbois  [u/fuzzyblankeet](https://new.reddit.com/u/fuzzyblankeet/)  and  [u/KrusteeBlanket](https://new.reddit.com/user/KrusteeBlanket/) have pointed out, used debt to finance these expansions.

It also means PLAY now has to pay a

>""weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings"" of ""4.03% "".

&#x200B;

Also of note in this section is this statement:

>"" Our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our ability to: incur additional indebtedness, make loans or advances to subsidiaries and other entities, pay dividends, acquire other businesses or sell assets. In addition, our credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratio covenants ""

which, as u/fuzzyblankeet has pointed out previously, means these guys are kinda stuck when it comes to responding to market changes. And **they wrote this note about restrictions an incurring additional debt back in December when their market cap was $1,200mm, 4x higher than the 300mm it is today.**

PLAY was paying interest per qtr of 6mm on these credit facilities.

We also find that PLAY, outside of operating expenses and payroll (the expenses incurred paying employees and running their customer facing locations) has G&A expenses (page 4) of 16mm per quarter. While when store close down we can cut operating expenses, G&A expenses cannot be cut as easily.

&#x200B;

Why have I mentioned all these items relating to payments?

well, because

&#x200B;

# CA$H I$ KING!!!

&#x200B;

Summary:

PLAY has a bunch of cash outflows that they are obligated to meet coming up.

Their revenue is essentially dropping to near $0 for the time being. They are sitting on a bunch of inventory which is mainly alcohol and food fro which they can't really convert to cash because they are usually not licensed to serve alcohol/food for off-premises consumption so that 30mm in inventories is probably more like 15mm when cash comes to crunch.

&#x200B;

Even if PLAY cut all their operating expenses to $0 they still have have a bunch of obligatory cash outflows that are ongoing, limited revolver left to draw on, very low cash reserves, and inventory that will be exceedingly difficult to convert to cash.

&#x200B;

On top of this: they made it so they can't really get bought out buy some other firm willing to snap up a company with a market cap of 317mm and debts of (this is pre-China Virus remember) 656mm.

&#x200B;

Now for the qualitative side:

PLAY notes

>The Company is currently a defendant in several **lawsuits filed in courts in California** alleging violations of California Business and Professions Code, industry wage orders, wage-and-hour laws and rules and regulations pertaining primarily to the failure to pay proper regular and overtime wages, failure to pay for missed meals and rest periods, pay stub violations, failure to pay all wages due at the time of termination and other employment related claims (the “California Cases”). Some of the California Cases purport or may be determined to be class actions or Private Attorneys General Act representative actions and seek substantial damages and penalties. With respect to these California Cases, where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, **the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of the reasonably possible loss** due to the inherent difficulties of predicting the outcome of uncertainties regarding legal proceedings

Now I had a friend who worked for a competitor to PLAY back when I was in college (a few years ago now) and I know a few people who have worked in and currently work in the ""hospitality"" industry (unfortunately, no strippers). If PLAY is anything like their competition and similar to any other restaurant: they will be settling or paying out on these lawsuits in California. I can almost guarantee that 80% of the paystubs they issued were incorrect, they almost 100% never paid out correctly on termination, and they 100% have violated overtime and mandated rest period rules.

Icing on the cake: Everyone who is anyone knows that companies that report EBITDA are more shady than the dark side of the moon. Why? because you can fiddle and diddle EBITDA more than Epstein can underage girls on an island to make it say whatever you want it to say. And PLAY provides EBITDA for us indicating they are a bit shady. But not only do they provide it in an effort to make themselves look good, but **compared to the year before their EBITDA for the quarter declined by 13.5% from the previous year (46mm to 39.8mm)!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, what you do with your money is up to you. A company this autistic in a market like this could default tomorrow and the stock would climb 300%, who knows. Nothing in this post should indicate I am suggesting any trade one way or another.

EDIT: As some have mentioned in the comments (for example: u/SparkOfLife538   u/landon0605   u/4cardroyal  u/fallweathercamping ) due to current economic situation, landlords will likely give extension on rents and today's earnings are for the period ending January 2020 (ie before big China Virus fears). This may indicate looking for options that are monthlies/quarterlies, rather than FDs.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, FDs are cheaper and have more upside (and downside) so YOLO to your personal risk tolerance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**POST CALL UPDATE:**

Lots of people are saying they are ""mooning""....This company was down 6% today and then up 7% AH....That nets out to a 1% gain on the day.

Per the earnings call they have:  
100mm cash on hand at March 31st **including the full draw-down of their credit facility**

A weekly burn rate (seemingly after furloughing all staff) of 6.2mm + 0.7mm in debt service charges. That's 6.9mm/week.

Do the math on that. This company has 3.5 months worth of cash with no ability to raise any more outside of an equity offering.

&#x200B;

When they re-open in June, spiking their Operating expenses and adding an additional (conservative estimate) 50% of their pre-crisis 6.4mm/week Operating payrolls (so an additonal 3mm cash burn/week),  where will their customers (who haven't been paid in 3 months) come from? Maybe from [brrr.money](https://brrr.money) ?

&#x200B;

They have competitors in the field, notably Ion Torrent and Pacific Biosciences. The major factor separating Illumina from its competition is its low error rate in calling inserted nucleotides. This low error rate is especially important in calling DNA variants which are prognostic, for instance, in cancer. In germline variant calling, as opposed to somatic (cancer) variant calling, you have many observations of a single nucleotide from which to base your evidence. In cancer, you're limited by both tumor purity (how much of the DNA you're sequencing is cancer) as well as base quality. Given Illumina suffers the least from base quality issues, it is well-poised (and is already in use) for clinical applications.

Currently the uses for Illumina technology are relatively isolated. If you walk into a big name cancer institute like Sloan Kettering or DFCI, your DNA is getting sequenced before you get to the front desk. At a less specialized or less advanced hospital this might not be the case.

So how will Illumina expand its market? It could target these smaller institutions, which is reasonable. The other thing it could do is demonstrate that its technology can be used for the early detection of cancer. This is important because if you detect cancer early, your prognosis is better. If, for instance, Illumina developed technology that could detect cancer from a patient's blood, then every American is going to wind up getting this test once every year or so. That's a big fucking market.

Well guess what? Illumina's spinoff company Grail Inc just published the first convincing evidence that they are able to do this. 

What's even better? Grail is using bisulfite sequencing for their technology which is even more hampered by error rates in sequencing. This leaves one option for the platform that these millions of diagnostic tests are going to be run on.

Illumina.

Which is pretty much fucking everyone.

Then next week they are allowing sole proprietors to apply for them as well. This will dramatically cut the number of unemployment applications and all the companies that are being granted these loans will be hiring back the entirety of their workforce. It's either that or they have to pay back large chunks of these loans.

I would expect unemployment to continue to surge in the next two weeks, followed by the numbers majorly dropping during the end of the month going into May. Once the stimulus money clears and everyone and their half sister are approved for these loans people will be getting hired back. I would expect the April hiring numbers that will be released in the beginning of May to be fucking massive.

I'm assuming this is going to cause a major surge at the end of April or beginning of May absolutely fucking Put holders that held too long.

BofA and GS are very likely to be under the total number. Any number below 5M is just not realistic. The joblessness claims numbers are going to break 5.5 million.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Iftu0ShgsMD74uWLVXcuY75h2o_YY4bD7cZnhHPrJK8/edit?usp=drivesdk

I've spent the last week tracking down local news coverage of governors and state officials letting the upcoming jobless claims numbers slip into their press briefings. I've gotten actual numbers for 16 states. These jobless numbers are anywhere from 5.2M to 7M... this week. Any estimate below 5M is just lazy fucking guessing. 

The best state number is Minnesota, with only a 3% increase from the previous week. Hawaii is the worst, with an 1100% increase (although that's an outlier). Many states will be near or exceed a 500% increase (AL, CA, CT, CO). I'm estimating (on the low side) that CA is about to report 1.1M losses.

Going through the other states news reports where i couldn't get a hard claims number, most are still reporting people are completely unable to get through (meaning many will still be unaccounted for this week). Most states are increasing employment of their unemployment claims officers by anywhere from 30% to 2x (I've forgotten which ones, I didn't save those links).

Estimating the other 34 states, if i live in fucking dream land where everything is rosy and the world isn't on fire, I could say a 20% increase from the previous weeks numbers is fair. On the high end maybe its a 300% increase (very unlikely on all 34 states)

Ohio, Texas, Massachusetts, and some others are particularly large wild cards in my estimates.

This gives a range of 5.2M on the low and 7.8M on the high end.... Now... These numbers may include revisions to the previous week. So what I'm saying is, if the reported number this week is 4.2M, then i expect revisions to the previous report to account for that missing million. But overall, newly reported losses will be  anywhere from 5.5-7.5M

That being said. I actually want to estimate it closer to 8 or 9 million, given that most states simply aren't keeping up with the call volume. But that's the wild card in the estimate.

edit2:

the ""priced in"" and ""Brrrr"" and ""meaningless"" comments are expected. and maybe you're right, today it might not mean shit. But the market hasn't priced in the continuing story of bad news. Today maybe it's just that the jobless number estimate was low (although I'm trivializing), but tomorrow that means the 30+M jobless estimate is low. You know what other estimate was low? The death count estimates that was given in a press conference at the White House 2 days ago, more on that below.

Pair that with the FACT that this shit isn't ending in April.... or May.... or maybe even June. It could easily go through the summer. Every mounting piece of bad news is more and more evidence to slowly convince every investor that this shit is not going to be whamm..bamm bye Covid -> to the fuckin' moon market. Every negative surprise is another anchor on the back of any bull. And every day the US is shutdown, people are jobless, and not spending cash, another company will become insolvent.

Once insolvencies start to begin... market panic will occur.

What I'm saying is... the market has been sold the ""best case"" story for 3 months. Slowly, every new puzzle piece in the picture will destroy that ""best case"" story. And we are so fucking far from the best case that it's just delusional. This is why [smart money is calling the market dysfunctional](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/outspoken-wall-street-bond-whiz-says-the-stock-market-is-acting-dysfunctional-and-may-hit-rock-bottom-once-we-take-out-marchs-low-2020-03-31). But the equity market won't stay dysfunctional once companies start blowing up - because they can't. Equity of a bankrupt company is 0, it doesn't matter what the fuck the market thinks. This will be the mid-cap, over leveraged, illiquid dog shit. This is why [these companies are ending 401k matching](https://money.yahoo.com/coronavirus-companies-begin-eliminating-401-k-matches-to-cut-costs-182416302.html). They have no cash flow.

edit 5: ok... so looking at the state to state data I can say I was wildly off on some estimates and spot on on others, thus is the estimation game. I did fuck up the initial claims vs insured unemployment in CT & CA (I counted them all as initial claims). overall, I expect this picture to continue even as SBA loans are being made. Simply because states have still not been able to keep up with calls. All the people who couldn't file last week are still filing this week, also big companies have just begun with mass layoffs this week. I'm still holding on.

There needs to be some genuinely good news re: the underlying problems before I start selling my puts.

USA revenue breakdown:

40% = legal collections, ie they sue people for the money

Voluntary payments stop when the the deadbeat loses their job. Wage garnihsments stop when the deadbeat stops getting wages and most creditors cannot garnish unemployment benefits. Their revenues are being hit on both sides.

Most civil courts are closed or closing. Debt collectors wait until the statute of limitations is almost expired to sue. This means the statue of limitations is expiring on many cases. By the time the courts reopen the deadbeats will be even more broke and that stimulus check will be spent already. Imagine buying debt that already not being paid, and then the biggest financial distaster in history hit thus increasing the chances 1,000,000% that the debt won't be paid.

Some of these might be overvalued, however, another interesting company in this area that seems to have been overlooked is Lakeland Industries ($LAKE). Lakeland was only up to $17.5 as of today, and was $15 a share in 2018 with no pandemic, and briefly hit $28 a share during the Ebola crisis. Perhaps this is because they have released no public statements regarding official sales numbers? Is there a potential play here? Lets take a look.

**What information can we find regarding potential sales? Or other numbers?**

\- Lakeland had $47.8M in inventory stocked up as of last quarterly report.

\- Lakeland hazmat suits and N95 masks have been sold out for over a month online on all websites.

\- 34% of their revenue comes directly from respiratory protection equipment or protective clothing (hazmat suits).

\- In 2014 during the Ebola crisis they sold 160k hazmat suits to the US state department, and more to the UK government. In other words, they have the connections necessary to do the same this time around too.

\- First shipments of PPE were in last 2 weeks of January (FY20 Q4), before most of the world started freaking out about Coronavirus, in both the US and China. No amounts given.

**Obviously there is demand, so how are they going about increasing production?**

\- They put factories on 12 hour shifts to maximize production, and are increasing sealed seam capacity by 30%.

\- They recently opened factories in India and Vietnam to expand production (initially they were planning to open these in January 2021).

**TLDR:**

Lakeland had a lot of PPE inventory sitting in warehouses. They've been shipping orders since the last two weeks of January. They sold out out fast online, so they increased factory shifts to 12 hours, and opened new factories in India and Vietnam. They have government connections in the US and UK from previous pandemics. Despite all this, Lakeland hasn't run up nearly as much as the rest of the Coronavirus stocks. Lakeland is my choice for the next Coronavirus stock to take off. **Earnings for the quarter ended January 31 are out April 15th.**",2020-04-04 06:35:20
DD,Prolonged US Economic Stagnation – Insufficient COVID-19 Mitigation,115,fulo9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fulo9k/prolonged_us_economic_stagnation_insufficient/,57,1585995812.0,"I’ve been crunching numbers on the US COVID-19 mitigation efforts on daily basis. It is clear to me that our current mitigation structure is vastly underwelming. I agree with some leading experts - the second pandemic wave is imminent.

In every simulation I’ve run/seen, one of the most important factors in spreading the virus is congregation of people in a closed public place for more than a couple minutes (the infection rate goes up dramatically). This is called the “Central Hub” infection factor.

https://preview.redd.it/lnx1okoslpq41.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fa44c06fab5f98e1d99d369d76faf83382cc28c

Below is the mobility matrix (data from Google) showing the change in people’s behavior over a 6-week period (from Feb 15 to Mar 30th). Some states fared better than others, but because the interstate transportation is wide open, the numbers must improve across the board.

**Mitigation Behavior in US (04/03/2020)**

https://preview.redd.it/b7woqp6knpq41.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=13e61206549f775cc950baf327f15c589c1fd5a5

The current mitigation efforts have produced some positive results (most notably in Transit Stations and Retail/Recreation categories) – but the drop should be over 90% to be effective. The Grocery/Pharmacy 22% drop is negligible and the Workplaces 38% drop is way too far from the mark. The Residential mobility increase of only 12% is also pitiful.

The only category that has shown sufficient improvement in mobility is Parks at 19% drop. That number is sufficient due to the outside nature of people congregation (much lower chance of infection).

**MBI – A way to track progress**

I’ve created a simple index called “Mitigation Behavior Improvement” (MBI) by assigning an arbitrary score to every category and utilizing the following formula:

**MBI = Sum (Scores) / Number (Scores)**

**MBI (04/03/20) = 10 / 6 = 1.7**

According to my calculations, in order to prevent a second wave, the MBI score has to reach 3.75-4.0, which seems far-fetched right now. The only way to get there is an immediate national lockdown with zero personal interstate movement.

**The Second Wave**

Once the restrictions are (even partially) lifted, there’s a high chance of the second infection wave. The second wave will be smaller than the first. Nonetheless, it would create additional frustration and despair. The infection curve will look something like this:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4tt22ac9mpq41.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f05a704c7a166c9e77e9e86f4bbd406ba75f89)

The government will set up facilities to issue “Immune IDs” on-site to people (with a photo ID) that were previously tested for COVID-19 and recovered. The papers will be issued only to people with specific antibodies (e.g. [https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/bd-to-offer-fingerstick-antibody-blood-test-for-covid-19](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/bd-to-offer-fingerstick-antibody-blood-test-for-covid-19)) in their blood.

People with such IDs will be able to travel/work inside and outside freely, as they are no longer infectious. However, by looking at the data I anticipate that only 10-20% will end up being immune by the end of first wave, which is not enough to restart the US economy.

TL;DR

Buy puts on SPY / individual companies at the first signs of initial recovery in Jul/Aug with Nov/Dec expiration, in anticipation of the second wave. The disruption to business/economy will be longer than anticipated (NOT priced in).",2020-04-04 06:23:32

**TL;DR V2.0: Fuck, some of you have the attention span of a gnat. When and if the OPEC+ meeting takes place and cuts happen (including the US and other major producers), oil will jump and stabilize (I'm guessing) around high $30s to mid $40s/bbl. But cuts will not be enough to offset the upcoming storage crisis, so it will drop again over the next few months. If the US doesn't participate, there will be no cuts and its a race to the bottom.**

**Positions:** Cash gang gang. Exited everything this morning because I was bleeding tendies and wanted a break. I am restricted by my job (cover news for oil and gas at an industry-specific data and analytics firm) from participating directly in energy markets, so I have and will have no stakes in anything that touches oil and gas.

Ok, round two. My last thread was a primer on the industry, and since there is a massively important OPEC+ meeting next week—however it shakes out—I figured I would write another thread about what’s going on and what could happen. Some of this will unavoidably be speculation because it deals with things that haven’t happened yet, but I promise I won’t pull anything out of my ass other than all those big green dildo-candles from the past two weeks. Again, I’m not giving you specific trades because 1) do your own DD and 2) I suck at trading and you really don’t want my advice.

**You get cuts, You get cuts, Everyone Gets Cuts!**

Oil got a kick in the pants yesterday when Trump tweeted that Saudi Arabia and Russia were going to agree to cut 10-15 MMbo/d of production. A lot of people immediately called bullshit, including Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov. However, later in the day Saudi Arabia called for an emergency meeting of OPEC+, which has been scheduled for Monday (may have been moved to the 8th or 9th now). Both Saudi Arabia and Russia have since said that they would be willing to make cuts of at least 10 MMbo, while also blaming each other for the price war (that Russia instigated and Saudi Arabia started).

The likelihood of OPEC+ alone agreeing to cut 10+ MMbo/d is pretty fucking low—I would say near zero. The cuts can happen, but it will have to involve the US and other major non-OPEC+ producers (Canada, Brazil, etc.), and Russia has said as much. Russia did not agree to the previous attempt to cut production in early March because every OPEC+ cut for the past three years has been back-filled by increases in US shale production (also sanctions on Rosneft and Nord Steam 2 probably). Agreeing to cuts that don’t involve the US will put them back at square one, and really even further back than that, as the other elephant in the room (15-20 MMbo/d drop in demand) will still be around and there hasn’t been enough time to do truly lasting damage to US producers.

Don’t be fooled by the bankruptcy of Whiting Petroleum; something like 50 US O&G companies filed for bankruptcy last year if I remember correctly, which was not unusual. If oil prices magically went back to “normal” next week and stayed that way, the number of bankruptcies likely wouldn’t be significantly higher—I can’t find the note from my firm, but if I remember correctly, analysts were anticipating a 10% increase in Chapter 11 filings (so \~55) before the price war began.

Now, you may be thinking something along the lines of, “This is fucking ‘Merica, we would never hobble the free market and limit production”. Well, think again: it’s not certain, but it is definitely a possibility. First off, there is historic precedent. Before OPEC came on the scene and started setting global prices in the 1970s, that job fell to the Texas Railroad Commission, which is still the regulatory agency for O&G in the state. The TRC began putting a quota on Texas oil production in the late 1930s after an oil boom in East Texas pushed prices down to $0.25/bbl. That agency effectively set world oil prices for the next three decades.

If you want a more recent example that is still comparable to the US (as far as having a free market economy and no NOC), look at Canada and Alberta. AB has been stuck between a rock and a hard place since 2016, with significant capital flight occurring in the oil patch due to lack of takeaway capacity and regulatory uncertainty. In 2018, because of that lack of takeaway capacity (mostly pipelines), oil storage filled nearly to the brim and differentials between the Canadian benchmark WCS and WTI collapsed. In order to protect the industry, the provincial government introduced production curtailments near the end of the year. Some companies complained about it, but many realized it was the only option they had.

They initially planned to end curtailment last year, but around August or September decided it would have to extend into 2020. As storage volumes have fallen and more takeaway capacity has come online—either through crude-by-rail or pipeline throughput optimizations—the provincial government has eased curtailment limits. They also began applying new exemptions, such as new conventional oil wells would be exempt from curtailment and producers could produce beyond their limits as long as the extra output was transported by rail. When the policy was first introduced, the first 10,000 bo/d was exempted from curtailment (protecting small producers), and that was expanded to the first 20,000 bo/d last fall. For anyone that produced over that—only 16 in Alberta with the 20k limit—the province applied a formula, which I won’t bother detailing here, to determine how much a company could produce so that overall production in the province stayed below the limit.

So, I’m not sure that the US federal government has the political will or ability to impose nationwide production quotas, but some states could. In fact, producers in Texas have already called for the TRC to pick up its old mantle and begin placing limits on production. One of the regulator’s commissioners has also called for a 10% production cut in the state, and the TRC plans on considering a cut at its next meeting. Of course, this is not a universally popular proposal (just as Alberta’s wasn’t) and some producers like Chevron are already complaining, but that won’t necessarily stop the TRC from imposing cuts.

State-level action, particularly from Texas, may be enough to convince OPEC+ to agree to cuts. Ohh, and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney and Trudeau have both said they would be willing to work with OPEC on cuts. And what state or provincial regulators don’t do, low oil prices will do for them. US E&P companies have already been shutting in uneconomic production, and that will continue or accelerate as long as oil prices remain depressed.

**You see the elephant over there next to the bus crash?**

I’ve already mentioned it twice, but do you remember what the other problem is besides the price war? An estimated drop—by Goldman Sachs, Vitol and others—in global oil demand of 15-20 MMbo/d at beer flu’s peak. Even with a 10 MMbo cut, it won’t be enough to keep storage levels from continuing to rise in the near-term. According to a recent Financial Times article, Kayrros satellite measurements indicated global crude stocks surged by over 100 MMbbl in March to 63% of nameplate storage capacity. We have never tested the maximum operating capacity of storage on a global level, so no one really knows what it is, how soon we reach it, or what exactly happens if we do. One thing we do know, and again we can look to Alberta circa 2018 for this, is that prices plummet as storage nears capacity.

It could get to the point that oil prices go negative and producers have to pay someone to take oil away. Now if that happens, producers would only be paying as long as it takes them to safely shut in all of their wells. And global storage capacity is a bit of a misnomer, because storage is regional and not global. If all the tanks that are tied to the Permian are full, it doesn’t matter if there is an empty tank in Nigeria, because you can’t get the oil there. Some pipeline operators in the Permian have already asked their clients to reduce production rates because storage is filling up.

Fatih Birol, the International Energy Agency’s executive director, spoke on the demand problem recently. He told Reuters that even if everyone agrees to global cuts of 10 MMbo/d, oil inventories would still rise by 15 MMbo/d in Q2. That will put significant downward pressure on oil prices.

**So what the fuck is going to happen? Here comes the speculation.**

I don’t know what’s going to happen on Monday, but here are how I see various scenarios playing out in my crystal ball.

1. OPEC+ cuts production by 10 MMbo/d, US is free and clear to do what it wants. I really don’t see this happening. I guess it’s a non-zero chance, but it has to be a small one. They’ve never cut production by more than 2.1 MMbo/d, and in March were only looking for 3.6 MMbo/d. You think they are desperate enough to triple that, totally fuck themselves, and let us go without a scratch? Maybe Saudi Arabia would, but Putin would give his balls a tug, grit his teeth and soldier on. Or, I could be totally fucking wrong. If anyone can give a convincing argument for why this is a likely outcome, I am genuinely interested in hearing it (so I can steal it for work).
2. Talks fall apart and nothing happens, price war continues, pretty simple outcome. Oil will fucking tank, O&G company stocks will tank, blood in the streets. Sub-$10/bbl WTI here we come (maybe not right away, but sooner rather than later). Production effectively stops region by region as storage fills to capacity until we reach a balancing point, if one exists in this nightmare scenario.
3. This is complex shit and they agree to do something, but they need time to hash out the details. This one is fucking boring, which means it’s what will probably happen because fuck us. I’m guessing prices will get a decent boost, but remaining uncertainty will pare gains somewhat. Or it might be as good as agreeing to 10+ MMbo/d cuts (or lead to the cuts), in which case look at the next one.
4. OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers agree to cuts on the order of at least 10 MMbo/d. In the near term, oil prices will see an immediate positive impact. I think they’ll stabilize in the $40-50/bbl range, which is where they were before the price war started. Maybe high $30s/low $40s as beer flu has spread more since then. This will make Putin particularly happy, because he will get to reign in US shale, balance his budget (needs average $42/bbl) and keep sticking it to Saudi Arabia a bit (they need $82/bbl to balance their budget).

US Producers I have to imagine would get a boost to their stock prices too, but they might have some downward pressure from mandated cuts at whatever level they occur (not enough to outweigh the good news though, probably). It would be a good idea for you to look at Canadian producers’ stock prices on the TSX, particularly larger producers who primarily operate in Alberta (such as oil sands) and how their stocks moved around the time curtailment was announced there (late 2018) and since. However, if you do that, remember Canadian companies were facing significant downward pressure from other sources such as regulatory uncertainty.

The upswing would likely be relatively short lived though. Over the next quarter or two—depending on how long beer flu bends global demand over the table—prices would start dropping again as storage fills up. Pure-plays (companies who only operate in one area/basin) would be particularly vulnerable to storage filling up in their region to the point that they have to entirely shut in all production. Diversified companies, particularly the supermajors, would hold out longer.

This scenario could lead to more cuts, but I sort of doubt it. Any cuts are going to be a hard sell, particularly on the scale we need them to be. Round two would be even worse. I also don’t think the pandemic will last long enough. However, recovery is going to take a lot longer. First the world has to get back to whatever the fuck it was doing before beer flu, and then demand has to pick back up to something like last year’s levels. Then, we have to slowly whittle down storage levels (Alberta has been at it for over a year, but Canada is a dumpster fire, so YMMV) and hope nothing else gets fucked up. As storage approaches normal levels, prices improve. If I was a betting man, I would wager a return to normal, or close to it, during the first half of next year, maybe Q1 if I was optimistic.

**BUT WHAT TRADES DO I MAKE ASSHOLE?!**

I told you, you don’t want my shit advice. If you made it this far, do some more of your own research and flip a coin on what will happen Monday, then make the appropriate bets. If you go for calls, unless they are LEAPs, be prepared to switch to puts later in the quarter regardless of what happens.

DD,Something not priced in...,27,fujxoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fujxoz/something_not_priced_in/,10,1585988950.0,"Huawei is still on the blacklist. They’ve just reported the smallest profit increase in three years. 

Huawei’s chairman said China will not “just stand by and watch Huawei be slaughtered.” 

He is implying Xi Pooh Pin Ping will retaliate against American tech companies trying to gain Chinese market share. Think Apple ban. 

No that’s not the play—not going to happen.

But it’s clear the US has started to financially hurt Huawei. This is important because 5G is considered to be of extreme strategic importance for continued US dominance as the global de facto superpower. 

Now, Huawei has just released their new P40 phone. And surprise surprise!!..

It has American tech inside. 

[Some astute tech geeks tore the phone apart and found it to contain Qualcomm, Skyworks, and Qorvo parts. ](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/huaweis-p40-phone-contains-us-parts-despite-blacklisting/%3famp=1)

How you ask? Aren’t they banned from doing business with Huawei? 

Loopholes. Loop fucking holes. 

When Huawei was asked to comment on this, they stated that they would never break any US regulations and their designs are completely LEGAL... And they are right. 

The Export Administration Regulation (EARS) was designed to stop shit like nuclear weaponry falling into the hands of terrorists. This regulation is now being used to stop American technology being sold to Huawei. 

The current ban states that any product with more than 25% US origin content CANNOT be sold to Huawei. 

However, American companies wouldn’t embody capitalism if they didn’t circumvent this ban. 

These dirty rotten commie unpatriotic companies circumvent this ban by having their chips made in Taiwan by TSMC, and then shipped to China. 

The chips are made internationally and specifically to fall under the 25% content origin rule. 

Basically for the mouth breathers... these supply chains fall out of US jurisdiction reach. 

The US government understands they’re being bamboozled tho. 

[They are now deciding whether to lower the de Minimis rule to 10% or even 0.](https://lawreview.syr.edu/no-way-huawei-proposed-rule-change-to-further-restrict-exports-to-china/)

Now, even though these chips are made offshore and away from US reach, TSMC uses American manufacturing equipment supplied by companies such as LAM research and AMAT. 

Because “American equipment” offshore is being used to manufacture these chips, the US would make it illegal to for TSMC to use American equipment to make chips to sell to Huawei—without a license. 

Without a license is just a formality—god knows that’s not happening. 

This is called a “direct to product rule.”

If the US imposed a a direct to product rule, it would make it illegal for TSMC to sell ANY chips made using US equipment to Huawei. 

The US government literally wants to choke Huawei in a BDSM style torture rack. 

Because even if Huawei could design their own chips and stop buying US, they would need TSMC to not use the American equipment. That is extremely difficult and unlikely on TSMC’s part. Damn near impossible. 

The US is basically destroying Huawei’s capability to not just access US chips, but chips altogether—from the largest and most robust manufacturer on the planet—TSMC. 

They are going for the jugular. 

*The Play:*

QCOM, SWKS, QRVO, AMAT, LAMX, TSM—these are all good plays, but these are fundamentally strong and sound companies—with exception of QRVO—they do not belong in the category with these titans. 

However, there is a better one from all these. 

A true gem 💎— a gem that when you wipe the dust off, realize you’re holding a turd in your hand... 

Enter NeoPhotonics—NPTN. 

This thing moves bigly on Huawei related news. 

Why?

[NPNT gets ~45% of its revenue from Huawei](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-CHINA-HUAWEI/0H001GSE93H2/index.html)

It moved up 16% a while back simply because Trump blurted out US companies need to be open to business with China—and some things like microchips aren’t even a national security concern. 

My guess is he got smacked and schooled by his advisors after saying this dumb shit as the newer chips are 100% useful for military grade equipment. 

That, or he had calls on semis’s that day—more likely he had calls. 

Back to NPTN... 

NPTN Earnings Transcript from March 2nd, 2020:

[If the existing de minimis threshold were to be lowered to 10%, without other changes, we would not expect a significant direct impact to our revenue outlook.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4328019-neophotonics-nptn-ceo-tim-jenks-on-q4-2019-results-earnings-call-transcript)

This means their products must contain less than 10% US origin content. That is why they are still selling to Huawei. 

These rotten commies have plants in China and Japan and are able to reduce their origin content to under 10% and thus able to sell to Huawei being under the allowed 25% total. 

*Here is the conclusion:*

IF the US goes all out and lowers the de Minimis threshold to under 10%, NPTN will have nearly half its revenue stream wiped out overnight. 

Huge. Fucking. Fall. 

Half it’s revenue stream. 

*Timeline*

Any minute. 

[It seems Trump officials have already agreed on the new measures for the de Minimis and to alter the direct to product rule.](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/03/27/us-prepares-crackdown-on-huaweis-global-chip-supply-sources-say.html)

I don’t know when the new measures will be made public, but the White House is also holding a 5G summit at some point in early April with the top tech Companies to discuss slowing down Huawei in its 5G expansion.

*Trade with a wind at your back*

The US China phase one trade deal states:

 [In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other.](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/phase%20one%20agreement/Economic_And_Trade_Agreement_Between_The_United_States_And_China_Text.pdf)

Can you put two and two together? 

Congratulations. 

Covid-19. 

Trump calls it the Chinese virus. China states it was released by the US. 

China at the moment looks to be the pandemic expert. US looks likes Italy’s retarded cousin. 

However, I think the recent intelligence report saying China is fudging their numbers will become a serious thing in the near future. 

There will be a row between Trump and Xi Pooh Pin Ping. With disruptions from beer flu, China might not be able to fulfill its side of the deal to buy designated American goods, let alone can the US manufacture them unless they’re considered essential (such as John Deere—they’re essential to food supplies). China will still have to buy John Deere from the great farmers lol. 

But at some point, because of Covid-19’s supply chain and global shut down disruptions, the US and China will ABSOLUTELY have to come back to the Trade deal and amend certain aspects of it. Things might not go smoothly after all this Coronavirus blow out next time they come to the table. 

Millions of Americans unemployed? Priced in. 

Not enough ventilators? Priced in. 

Millions Americans dying? Priced in. 

Corporate bonds bursting? Priced in. 

Companies going bankrupt? Priced in.

US-China phase one falling apart? Absolutely NOT fucking priced in. 

This could be the driving force for the next leg down. 

This play has the wind at your back. As a general and specific put play if you’re bearish.

Each month, the ETF sells its futures and buys new futures for the next month out. One of the big challenges is that contango (when the actual price of the commodity is lower than the futures face value) can eat into the assests of the fund.

I think that starting now, contango will actually invert into backward-retardation, as the price of WTI will keep rising over the next few months.

USO's previous futures roll took place 06 March 2020 thru 11 March 2020. The front month futures prices on those dates were $41.28, $31.13, $34.36, $32.98, respectively.

USO's futures roll for April will take place 07 April 2020 thru 13 April 2020. As of today, the front-month futures price is $29.00.

I submitted a post last week summarizing some issues in the mortgage industry. It was a long article from Barry Habib with some insight/conclusions. I'm writing this to add to that post with some additional info about what's going on in the industry and how the forbearances are impacting mortgage servicing.  

The two big points from the previous post that I'll touch upon:
Margin Calls - the Fed buying mortgage-backed-securities (MBS) was causing lenders to run into significant margin calls, a fairly significant risk to lenders. Lenders hedge their locked loan pipelines against market fluctuations. 

Forbearance Poses Risk to Lenders - The CARES Act, Section 4022, provides that a mortgage servicer must provide borrowers a forbearance of up to an initial 180 days, and then it can be renewed for a subsequent 180 days. During this period, the servicers are expected to keep making payments to the asset owner - Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac / Ginnie Mae (the government sponsored enterprises, or GSEs). So, even if providing the borrower the loan forbearance required by the CARES Act, a servicer is sending payments to the GSEs. As I'll discuss below, the Act does not identify specific methods to resolve the forbearance at the end of the period. 

So, whats new?
Well, the margin call is still an issue - but the fed backed off of their level of MBS purchasing by a little bit, but not enough to resolve the issue. Lenders clearing out their active loans will help resolve this, so in time it will improve as long as the Fed continues to be timid on MBS purchase. It will still hurt lenders but I don't think this is going to be a nail in the coffin for any of the big servicers. 

The forbearance process is worth further describing. So, hypothetical situation: lets say I have a mortgage serviced by Quicken (don't get excited they are private) and I just heard the CARES Act allows me to skip payments. I'm a waiter, I just got laid off, I could really use 3 months without my $2k mortgage payments. I call them, wait on hold for two hours, and then they agree to let me not make payments for the next three months - and they will send the info to sign. Great, right? Almost too good to be true. 

So, here are the three outcomes of a forberance after Quicken quickly agrees to it:

1.) BY DEFAULT -  From the borrower's perspective, I don't hear anything for three months. Then, in month 4, Quicken calls and says I have 4 payments, three of which are ""delinquent."" I now learn there are 4 payments - all due in month 4. Well, hold on I just returned to work I don't have $8k - what can I do besides YOLO FDs? Well, probably not much. 


2.) Payment Plan - the next option is to resolve that past due $6k on a payment plan, if the lender agrees to this. So instead of a $2k payment, I might have a $2500 payment for a year. Now I just returned to my service industry job - I was already paycheck to paycheck, I have all sorts of other past due credit card/auto/student loan bills from being laid off, and now my mortgage is 25% higher. That's not going to work for me.


3.) Loan Modification - A loan modification is the option that everyone thinks they are getting through CARES Act by default - it extends the term of the mortgage and adds the missed payments to the end. This is not a scenario that will be provided over the phone as an immediate solution if I call Quicken and ask. It has to be applied for, I would have to qualify, and it has to be approved by the lender. It is not a trivial request, and it will not be approved lightly given the current lending environment and amount of credit risk. Plus, considering the lender has already made 3+ payments to the GSEs without one from me - they are going to want to quickly determine whether this is going to be a performing loan or a non-performing loan (more to come on this). They will want to flush out the good loans from the bad as soon as they can get past the time periods required in the CARES Act. 

So, a loan modification requires a level of qualification (credit check, paystubs, etc.). As a borrower, I am then going to have to show this lender the amount of debt I've racked up paying for everything with credit cards while laid off - and how fucked my credit has gotten not paying any bills while waiting for my $1200 Starbucks allowance from the Feds.

I am a Loan Officer, as mentioned in the previous post. Half my week has been talking to past clients about forbearanaces, and most of them just want a few months of skipped payments so they can relax about the economy and have that safety net. Sure, some have lost their jobs or are on the verge of losing their jobs - in which case it makes sense, your alternative is worse. One owns three rentals I've financed and 0/3 renters can pay their rent this month. 

SO MANY PEOPLE are requesting the forbearance on an elective basis that our industry experts are begging real estate professionals to properly describe to them how this works, and what they will be faced with. Servicers are quick to approve the forbearance, and the borrowers are not understanding the possible outcomes. 

I have a friend I consider to be a business-minded, prudent, and intelligent individual. He called servicers for two properties, US Bank and Wells Fargo - one offered a forbearance of 3 months and the other offered 6 months. He took them, they said they'd send something for him to sign but that it was in effect. Neither made any effort whatsoever to explain to him the resulting options at the end of the forbearance. He called me to ask if it would have any adverse impact, as they had not described the process well to him. 

These are call centers taking the requests, obviously they are doing what they can to get to the next call.  

My company has a $110B servicing portfolio, and we got 8000 requests for forbearances IN A WEEK. Mr. Cooper (subject of my last post) has a $640B servicing portfolio. 

At the end of this initial 3-6 month forbearance that lenders are required to offer, we are going to see lenders quickly decide how to handle each file. As mentioned above, they consider the account delinquent during the forbearance (although not reported to credit) - so they already have a jump on the next steps to collect past-due payments. There will likely be a flood of ""performing"" loans (paid on time) turning into ""non-performing loans"" (past-due 180+ days). If a loan becomes non-performing, the GSEs end up auctioning off the assets (mortgage notes) in blocks. These blocks are generally bought at auction by funds and securitized into non-performing loan MBSs. Of the companies that do this, there are only a few that have publicly traded entities. 

Now, I'll touch briefly on what is going on with mortgage lending - because a lot of the servicers like Quicken have revenue split between originating and servicing:
Purchase Volume - The last two weeks we saw purchase mortgage applications decline 15% and 11%. Personally, I have had a noticeable reduction in purchase apps, and all of my preapproved borrowers are putting their home search on hold.
Refinance Volume - Because of current credit risk lenders are considering, rates are only attractive on an owner-occupied primary residence with an optimal borrower. Low credit score, investment properties, etc., have rates so high they don't make sense. 
General Volume - Loan programs have tightened up considerably in the last two weeks. Yesterday my company scrapped all of our jumbo programs. We had already scrapped all of our non-QM programs (subprime). Our FICO requirements are up 40 points, for self-employed individuals we can only use 75% of their income now, use of gift funds is more restrictive, etc. We are definitely going to see less individuals qualifying for financing because of these guideline adjustments. 

TL;DR folks can start here with only knowing ""non-bank mortgage lenders in trouble""

How to use this info:
1.) Puts on non-bank mortgage lenders - They are going to suffer because all of their revenue comes from originating and the residual from servicing. They are going to lose the servicing revenue on a significant amount of non-performing loans, and they are going to have trouble originating loans for at least a few months. My last post included COOP, the largest publicly traded servicer - they also originate. I still like it and expect the underlying share price to continue to decline, but the premiums are outrageous right now. I like puts on any non-bank publicly traded mortgage originating/servicing company. Not 100% in line with this recommendation, but I decided to make a move on REM which is a closed-end mortgage-based REIT. It has 80% in residential mortgage securities and 20% commercial (which I also think is vulnerable). 
So, REM 15p 10/16

2.) I spent a long time last night reading the auction results from non-performing loans and then looking up the buyers to see which publicly traded companies might mostly focus on NPLs. I wanted to buy calls on companies that focus on NPLs, anticipating they would have a higher volume in coming months. Most are either private, or they securitize the loans and aren't exposed, or they are too diversified in other aspects of real estate to anticipate the NPL volume helping share price. I don't have a great play here. If someone wants a fun research project, go try to find a company who services NPLs, is publicly traded, and is not well-diversified. Although I did not find them buying recent auction pools (I only looked at '19) I did take a position in [an option with an underlying value too low for this post to get approved] because they focus on NPLs and at an auction long ago they received 90% of the NPLs being offered by the GSEs. The premiums were cheap and their share price is 30% of what it was in February. 

There are some banks with significant mortgage servicing rights, but I think the Feds are more likely to let the non-bank lenders fail. 

If anyone has any suggestions on positions to take based on this info, please do comment with it. I know we had some MBS guys and other people in the mortgage industry comment on the last post, would be interested for more input. 

TL:DR : Fed says you don't have to pay your mortgage, lenders agree quickly to forbearances, borrowers will be expected to pay in full at the end of the period - but they aren't understanding that, on a large scale. 
COOP 5p 10/16 (but maybe wait for a bounce the premiums are nuts)

DD,Long Calls PTON - Peloton Earnings Play,20,fud37x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fud37x/long_calls_pton_peloton_earnings_play/,21,1585965438.0,"Peloton earnings is 5/5. I’m going long and here’s why:

**Part 1: Anecdotal Demand Evidence:** Let’s start with some anecdotal evidence on demand for home gym equipment. Take peek at stock levels for Rogue, Titan, random amazon sellers, etc. Everything is sold out or back ordered 1+ months. For what they do have in stock, shipping is delayed because they have hit their shipping operations capacity. Peloton likely won’t have issues with stock out as they likely build a huge stockpile of inventory for their massive holiday sales season  (228 revenue period ending sept 2019 vs 428 revenue period ended Dec. 2019 – huge amount of sales at end of year)

Dont @ me about people not dropping big cash on gym equipment during a recession. Rogue is sold out of their $7500 monster banshee rack and every other piece of overpriced equipment they sell including the $1000 concept 2 bike they distribute.

[https://www.roguefitness.com/concept-2-erg-package](https://www.roguefitness.com/concept-2-erg-package)

[https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-monster-rm-8-banshee](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-monster-rm-8-banshee)

**TLDR Part 1:** People are loading up on home gym equipment like never before - Uppies

**Part 2: Revenue Conjecture:** Q2 report gave the following guidance for Q3 sales: Peloton said Third-quarter revenue of $470 million to $480. Q3 captures Jan – March. Sales probably started sky rocketing end of February into March so let’s say they meet their low end target Jan – Feb and blow past in March by 50%. That puts revenue at $548 million or an increase over expected by 13%. This calculation is pure conjecture but it is supported in a few ways:

* App download 5x normal: [https://seekingalpha.com/news/3555563-peloton-gains-on-report-of-download-spike](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3555563-peloton-gains-on-report-of-download-spike)
* Social media following (Instagram) has a huge spike in march: [https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/onepeloton](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/onepeloton)
* Deliveries delayed:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fke06p/long\_calls\_on\_pton/fks95ll/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fke06p/long_calls_on_pton/fks95ll/?context=3)
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnku24/insider\_sold\_41m\_of\_pton\_at\_26\_instead\_of\_buying/fla1o9s/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fnku24/insider_sold_41m_of_pton_at_26_instead_of_buying/fla1o9s/?context=3)

Delayed deliveries is key here. If the comments are true on deliveries getting pushed from standard 2 weeks to 6 weeks, they are at 3x capacity, or selling three times as many bikes per day than they expected and hired delivery drivers for.  I doubt they are 3x in every market so I'm not gonna read into that 3x number too much but it is certainly directional on demand increase and points to the fact that my 50% increase for demand in March is probably on the conservative end.

**TLDR Part 2:** Social media following up, app subscribers up, deliveries backed up- points to sales up = stock uppies

**Part 3: Bad News is Good News:** They recently cut tread deliveries which WSB seems to view negatively, but I believe that to be a net positive for *this* earnings report. From my readings of their quarterly reports tread is the lower margin product so all existing delivery resources are now devoted to fulfilling the huge demand on bike deliveries, the higher margin product.

""Our Connected Fitness Product gross margin decreased slightly for the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the increasing mix of deliveries of Tread which currently carry a lower gross margin than our Bike""- Q2 report

So same headcount resource cost for delivering, but devoted to delivering huge spike in demand on higher margin product = higher net income.  Its not specifically broken out in the earnings reports, but I don't think tread was ever a huge portion of their revenue to begin with- maybe 15-20%.  Bike is their core product and will completely offset any losses incurred from cancelling tread.

Additionally, tread deliveries went until about March 18th, so they are really only going to be missing 2 weeks of sales on this report, which could still in theory exceed the tread revenue of the previous report due to higher than expected growth of demand as tread is a fairly new product.

""As of December 31, 2019, approximately 3% of our Connected Fitness Subscribers owned both a Bike and a Tread""- Q2 report.

Edit 4/4: The more I think about this tread thing, the more I suspect dropping tread deliveries was not a tough decision for PTON.  Think about the product. Their tread is massive and bulky.  Can probably only fit like 4 of those in the vans they deliver with wheras the bike you can probably fit 10-15 of the bike.  If you have earnings coming up and see a way to blow past your numbers do you want to use 2 headcount resources to deliver 4 low margin products a day or 2 headcount resources to deliver 10-15 high margin products a day.  Its a no brainer, I'm confident in my suspicion that this was a move guided by COVID safety but affirmed by driving revenue.

**TLDR Part 3:** All focus has inadvertently been shifted to higher margin product and will more than offset the 2 week loss in tread sales, uppies

**Part 4: Bonus Uppies:**

* “Manufacturing Partner Acquisition - In October 2019, we completed the acquisition of one of our long-time, Taiwan-based bike manufacturing partners, Tonic Fitness Technology, Inc., or Tonic.” – Q2 report

Cost benefits from this acquisition should start hitting the balance sheet this quarter. I’m no expert but I would think that owning your supplier = paying the profit margin on manufacturing to yourself = higher margins on your existing highest margin item (bike) = higher net income. (Not to mention greater control over inventory, quality, scheduling, shipping, etc).

&#x200B;

* ***""Launch in Germany -*** In November 2019, we took another important step in our international expansion with the launch of Peloton in Germany. With our entry into Germany, we are in the three largest fitness markets in the world (United States, United Kingdom, and Germany). Germany also marks our first time offering non-English language content to users on our platform courtesy of our new German cycling instructor who has already begun producing classes from our temporary studio in London. To support our sales efforts in Germany, we have opened several retail showrooms across the major metropolitan areas of Germany and began a full-scale national television and digital media campaign in January 2020 to build brand and product awareness. "" -Q2 Report

Yeah guess what countries are also largely stuck at home?  Whatever sales PTON projected for UK and Germany when they made the Q2 report are likely blown out of the water.  For reference, the German Peloton instructor is Erik Jager. His IG followers (hauptstadttrainer on IG) are up 13% over the last 14 days and huge spike in March overall.

[https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hauptstadttrainer](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hauptstadttrainer)

Whats a huge driver of Pton instructors following?  People buying PTON bikes and using those workouts.

**TLDR part 4:** Cheaper manufacturing costs on their biggest seller – stock uppies.  Germany and UK stuck at home - huge incremental unforseen demand opportunity on top of what they projected for international.

**TLDR in summary:** To me all signs point to beating revenue expectations by a double digit %. A few signs point to better earnings per share than previous quarterly reports.

50% PTON 5/15 32c  - For risk balance

35% PTON 5/15 35c - Bacuse the stock went to $35 before Q2 issued decreased Q3 revenue guidance so its a safe target

15% PTON 5/15 40c because YOLO

Edit 4/12. Nautilus earnings provide further confirmation of demand for home gym equipment right now. Instagram following up another 30k since I posted this.",2020-04-03 21:57:18

[EFA, 1M Candles](https://preview.redd.it/wlk80ex7ejq41.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a360d09208875f78cbbbd753434e271ee4a5592b)

EFA is an ETF with exposure to securities in Europe, Australia, and the Far East. Some notable names of their 923 holdings include Nestle, Novartis (pharmaceutical company), and Toyota. What’s important about this ETF is that it excludes U.S. and Canada securities. If you want to know more about about it, since I know you’re too incompetent to find the big fucking search bar at the top of your browser, here you go: [https://www.etf.com/EFA#overview](https://www.etf.com/EFA#overview).

Take a look at the chart, particularly post 2007. It’s essentially been trading sideways ever since, with its most recent peak (marked by the big 🌈 magenta line)  being *lower* than it was in 2007. Speaking of its most recent peak, take a look at the date of that peak at the bottom of the beautiful magenta line. *This ETF has been on the decline since January of 2018.*

Okay, perhaps that’s a coincidence. Maybe Toyota and Nestle haven’t been sucking enough JPOW BRR printer dick to get their share of that unlimited under-the-table QE.

EEM is another ETF that tracks investments of emerging market firms. It’s almost entirely represented by Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, India, and China. Most notable of its 1225 holdings include Alibaba, Samsung, and Tencent (info here: [https://www.etf.com/EEM#efficiency](https://www.etf.com/EEM#efficiency)) Again, we see that it has traded sideways since 2007 and has been on the decline since January of 2018. Let's go bigger.

This is the MSCI world index excluding U.S. holdings. This index captures large and mid cap stocks across 22 of 23 developed market countries. It, too, has traded sideways since 2007 and has been on the decline since 2018. I could go on.

All this is to say, this is a long time coming. As to the why, the short answer is who the fuck knows? The longer answer is likely multi-factorial, resulting from a failure to adequately rectify the fiscal policy shortfalls that caused the ‘08 recession. Lending to those who shouldn’t be lended to in large amounts and being surprised when the whole shebang goes tits up, then slapping a band-aid on the issue by slashing interest rates and creating stimulus packages (sound familiar?) Let’s not even bother reinstating laws like the Glass-Steagall act that many economists believe would have prevented it all to begin with, let’s just fix it long enough to make it someone else’s problem after the boomers die or retire. The failure to eliminate the underlying causes of the ‘08 crash has had the global economy teetering on the re-entry into a full blown recession *for years,* but no one gives a fuck here in the states because all we care about are the U.S. large caps. Ya know, ‘murica and all that bud-light-drinkin’ shit. Stonks be goin up, all is gud.

**Thanks For The History Lesson, but Who Fucking Cares?**

I’m glad you asked. Speaking of history, the average length of a bear market is 10 months (1). Although, averages can be inflated a lot by outliers, like the 1929 bear market that lasted 61 months (2). The shortest ever bear market was 3 months in 1990, and was mostly due to central banking policy attempting to wrangle inflation like automod wrangles you autists and the invasion of Saddam Hussein into Kuiwait, causing a spike in oil prices (3). We are hardly 6 weeks into this bear market and, needless to say, these are very different circumstances.

This is not an issue that can be band-aided through stimulus packages and slashed interest rates. All these years of high-risk lending is going to dick everyone down by these cuts in production caused by the beervirus. I sincerely believe that the Fed and the gov’t in general are just delaying the inevitable (and vegafucking my tendies) under the aforementioned retarded boomer logic. 

We’re in it for the long haul boys. Diamond hands.

DD,The return of the Mormons – why Utah is probably the next epicenter,666,fv10nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fv10nd/the_return_of_the_mormons_why_utah_is_probably/,323,1586062038.0,"Being an aviation nerd, I noticed something strange on my flight tracker app. Fiji Airways is operating a nonstop flight from Nadi to Salt Lake City, a route they don't normally operate. Strange. Further investigation showed another odd flight, this time a LATAM 767 coming in from South America into SLC. My initial thought was that these planes were being shipped to America for long term storage because there was NO possible way that sudden demand between Nadi and Salt Lake City warranted a nonstop flight.

But then I found this article: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/31/mormon-church-is-chartering-jets-bring-thousands-missionaries-home/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/03/31/mormon-church-is-chartering-jets-bring-thousands-missionaries-home/) (press the X in your browser as soon as loading is complete to avoid ad block popup)

The Mormon church waited until the very last minute to bring home missionaries from the Philippines. Even travel restrictions by the US government didn't phase them. It took the president of the Philippines fucking threatening to kill people who violated quarantined for the Mormon church to take this seriously. Now that most international flight schedules have been canceled, their only option is to charter jets, hence the Fiji Airways and LATAM flights.

From their own website, it appears that these are VERY recent developments. By recent, I mean APRIL-recent. And as for the Fiji Airways flight, it is still in the air as I am writing this. [The Mormon website](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/coronavirus-update#missionary-work) states that only two missionaries have tested positive for the virus so far, and all are being ordered to self-isolate in their homes before returning to missionary activities in the USA. If you're reading this and thinking ""what the actual fuck, I've been quarantined for almost 3 weeks and they're just brining back missionaries now?"", you're not alone.

So what businesses will be affected by this? **EVERY BUSINESS THAT USES CALL CENTERS BASED IN AMERICA.** American call centers frequently favor Utah because of its large population of well-educated young adults: [https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article\_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html](https://www.standard.net/news/business/low-cost-young-workforce-makes-utah-a-magnet-for-call/article_186c92d0-e2c2-552e-add6-59127ddd8468.html). Additionally, Skywest is based in Utah. If you're wondering where the connection between Mormons and Utah is, then you simply haven't been to Utah. In fact, it is safe to assume that Utah is the **only** state still experiencing an influx of international travel.

Mormons are good people, just like the rest of us. It is a shame those in charge of their organization failed to recognize this potential risk and is now endangering an entire state. I do not currently hold any positions related to this, as I have just made the discovery today. With that said, I am a full on bear.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR –** The Mormons forgot to bring their kids home from the third world and they're chartering big jets to do it now. Buy puts.

That’s seriously hindering my ability to look at charts, read zero hedge, and occasionally make up some bullshit about fundamentals.

So this DD is going to be brief. Let’s be honest, y’all don’t want details anyhow. 

OPEC and Russia are not fucking going to bail out US shale. The United States is not joining an oil cartel comprised mostly of our enemies. It’s not going to happen. 

Meanwhile, global GDP is going to plunge more than any other time in the modern era. 

So there an unprecedented glut in oil. 

That means returns to oil storage are extraordinarily high. Which means VLCC day rates are extraordinarily high. Which means companies that own VLCCs are going to make a lot of money.

But semenbiscuit, how do you know it’s not already priced in?

Because the value of a VLCC is extremely transparent. And it doesn’t change all that much. So you can calculate the NAV of tanker stock on the back of box of tendies. And most of the these stocks are trading right at or even below their NAV. Go check for yourself, or just trust me. I don’t care.

That means very limited downside, because they aren’t going to trade far below NAV, but a shit load of potential upside. Because if day rates stay elevated (and they will) they’re going to be earning ridiculous returns over the next few quarters.

Here is what we know:

\-Oil supply is expected to beat demand by 30 million bpd (bpd=barrels per day) in April

\-Trump wants Saudi and Russia to cut 10 million bpd

\-If Saudi and Russia cut 10 million bpd thats half their total output and twice what OPEC has ever cut

\-Saudi and Russia are sick of doing the cuts while USA take their market share

\-Saudi and Russia want USA to join in on the cuts

\-It is illegal for USA or its companies to join forces to cut and raise prices intentionally

\-Even if they cut 15 million bpd that will still leave 15 million bpd over supply

\-Even if they cut 15 million bpd that will only buy an extra 6 weeks until world oil storage if full

So why did price jump so much? I think its a dead cat bounce or momentum traders. It will most likely crash again to 20 and once storage nears capacity even as low as 10

Edit - a point I missed too, 05APR Sauidis release their the May oil prices, being the day before the meeting it will prob be very cheap to hurt everyone more and act as a bargaining chip

DD,Follow up on MAR DD,52,fvjtra,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvjtra/follow_up_on_mar_dd/,58,1586144296.0,"Hey, just a follow up on the indebtness analysis of MAR. 
Now down 15% since the DD.

It looks like pretty much everything I said happened, except it seems like the bank has waived the affirmative covenant as they let MAR withdraw 100% from their revolver.


« Marriott International Inc. (NASDAQ: MAR) said Friday it is borrowing $2 billion from an existing credit facility to increase its cash holdings and “preserve financial flexibility” in the face of market uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents. The Bethesda hotel giant said it is maxing out its $4.5 million credit facility with its latest borrowing. As of March 17, the company had taken out $2.5 billion for the primary purpose of paying back matured promissory notes. »


So what next? Well MAR is banking on the fact that the 2B extra cash withdrew will be enough to weather the storm. It also looks like they had either longer term paper reissuance or they replaced their balance with notes or had cash on hand.


Now I guess the question is now that it dropped 15% is the DD priced in?

That is actually a really good question SP dropped 5% while MAR moved 3X, so part of the movement of MAR can be attributed to overall market sentiment, but at least a bit of the movement should be due to them drawing 100% of the revolver.

MAR essentially has no money left they can borrow without significantly more expensive debt and being leveraged to the tits. We should be asking ourselves two questions. 

How long can MAR survive with 2B$, and once market starts recovering, what return will be expected from the hotel industry. These two questions alone should help you define term and action plan for MAR. 

Q1 report will give a very clear indication of question #1, but will be priced in quickly.

Enjoy the tendies.

TLDR; how long do you think MAR can last with 2B$, barely any revenue, and reduced cost of doing business.

Edit: the fact the banks waived the affirmative covenant is an indication that they strongly believe either MAR is not at significant short term risk or that these loans will be guaranteed by the government. Either scenarios indicated not to be too worried about long term solvency of Mariott. Does not mean they won’t face significant pressure and lose significant market value.",2020-04-05 23:38:16
DD,A look into ITCI,30,fvjhcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fvjhcg/a_look_into_itci/,24,1586143096.0,"So here's my first attempt at a DD

&#x200B;

Intra-Cellular Therapies Inc (ITCI) is a pharmaceutical company that tries to find new solutions for nueropsychiatric and neurologic disorders. (Yes that means stupids like us).

**Outline:**

1. **Current medicines**
2. **Upcoming medicines**
3. **Why now**

No need to even go to the bottom, **TL;DR SPY 220p 4/20**

&#x200B;

In December, ITCI got FDA approval for a new drug, Caplyta, for adults with schizophrenia, which became available in pharmacies on March 23. Stock price shot up form $12->$35 as pharma stocks normally due after approvals. Following the trend, it started to decline until there was a stock offering, around $29 for 10,000,000 shares and then it was hit by the CC (corona crash) and is now sitting at $15.81.

Their, drug, which on the word of my psychiatrist is quite novel, and only has mild side effects. But that is besides the point. Effective drug, mild side effects and 3.5 million adults means some decent sales.[some numbers or something](https://sardaa.org/resources/about-schizophrenia/)

&#x200B;

But that's not even the best part, they have a few trials in phase three for Biploar depression and Dementia.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/20sdqqpfu1r41.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa351c357f85d79c66d38c97d14203889ab0b09c

[Image Link](https://www.intracellulartherapies.com/technology-and-pipeline/)

**Yes yes, an FDA approval**, even in phase 3 can take up to three years or more. But here is the saucey part, the same drug that got approved for schizophrenia is the one currently on trial for bipolar and dementia (along with the necessary additions). While this doesn't prove a lot to us, we do know that this drug has already been approved for other disorders, so it seems the safety of it may no longer be on trial, but rather the effectiveness of treating other disorders. Now I'm not well versed on FDA approvals, and I'd ask anyone to read more about it, or ask someone who knows a bit more the process before listening to anything I say here.

&#x200B;

**The last point**, people don't stop buying medicine during a virus, people are still going to need their pills. So while the stock is already priced down because of corona, it might be worth taking a look at investing, because if there earnings is at all good, then the company is probably going to go from being your average pharma stock, to perhaps having a few reasonable treatments on the market.

**EDIT:**

Sorry to break whatever order I had when I started, here is a link providing specific information about the drugs currently in trials: [10-Q](https://ir.intracellulartherapies.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intra-cellular-therapies-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-5), or if you don't want to read that:

"" Our global adjunctive bipolar depression Phase 3 trial, Study 402, is ongoing.  We anticipate reporting topline results from this trial in mid-2020. ""

and

"" Subject to the results of Study 402 and our interactions with the FDA regarding our bipolar depression program, in late 2020 we expect to submit a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for regulatory approval for lumateperone for the treatment of bipolar depression. ""

or if you don't know how to read paragraphs:Results for one drug come back mid 2020, the other is submitted late 2020.

Some things to think about:

1. I don't know much and this is my first time doing research on a stock
2. You'd probably want to know something about the FDA approvals process before investing
3. I don't know how much of the schizophrenia economic pie they are going to take from existing brands
4. Before their next drug gets approved, they'll probably start hiring drug reps, to promote the new drug after its approved, you could look at this as an indicator for approvals (I think)

I honestly don't know if I could recommend an options play on this stock because of the timelines, but if you keep it in your back pocket for a couple months and drug gets approved for a different disorder, you could possibly see some nice returns.",2020-04-05 23:18:16

He's also Chinese and works closely within the tech space.

Zoom's operations in the US is limited to mainly advertising, sales and customer support. There's a light group of software engineers, but those are mostly front end.

The back end - the real tech - is all developed in China. Why? Because it's cheap and Chinese engineers are actually very good and able to work the schedule. Thus, essentially ZM is like WeBull, but on a way more scary scale because they collect all kinds of data - biometric, business, communications and more.

In order to get to this size, and being located/closely linked to China, of course the Chinese government is involved. The Chinese government sees this as a golden goose that just dropped into their laps - and conforms with what the Chinese government wants: foreign data (again, biometric, business and communications). The fact that ZM has had so many issues with privacy in recent days is showing cracks in the dyke: Chinese engineers don't care about privacy and thus don't work it into the software, and all this leaked data of course finds its way to the Chinese government.

Recent news that fueled these prostitutes?

So, Trump wanted lower prices for oil but now is in panic because prices have spiraled out of control.

Unfortunately, he has ran into some serious issues... Meeting with Texas oil prostitutes... they did not accept the idea of cutting output.

So, lets go back to TA - Red lines tell you everything....

So we should see a nice bounce on /CL before we see any major dip below 20's, this is supported by many TA and other indicators. After a slight bounce we should see further decline in price of oil as we go into a storage issue.

While all of that is happening. /NG also known as NATURAL GAS is benefiting from all this fuckery.

Let me explain:

There are more people at home now than ever. People are cooling and using their furnaces... they use NAT GAS. Also, as wells begin to close due to oil capacity.. there will be less NAT GAS available.. Increasing prices.

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/natural-gas-oil-aeco-wcs-wti-1.5520910](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/natural-gas-oil-aeco-wcs-wti-1.5520910)

NAT GAS has bottomed out and shows major signs of recovery... while looking at the option chain.. we notice this...

Theres a huge disparity in /NG prices. So we should see a flush to 2's very soon.

Hi friends. I've talked about this in discord a few times over the weekend but wanted to make an actual post to echo the sentiment of folks seeing the Zoom bubble. It's [CEO is a moron](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-04/zoom-ceo-messed-up-as-trolls-invade-a-coronavirus-haven-wsj) but acknowledged the fuck up. The [privacy risks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/03/thousands-zoom-video-calls-left-exposed-open-web/) are through the roof. [New York already dropped them](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/04/us/nyc-schools-zoom-online-security/index.html). 

You know this, it's all been posted here before. What you may not know is [Zoom has shitty encryption, lied about it, and is handing out encryption keys from China](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/zoom-meetings-weakly-encrypted-and-get-keys-from-china-546038). Even then it may have been posted here I didn't check because I'm retarded.

What does this really mean, though? I work in the InfoSec community. My little company is pulling thousands of Zoom contracts for DoD contractors amid privacy concerns. There are strict guidelines for transmission of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) - which encompasses controlled technical information (CTI) and covered defense information (CDI). I, as an InfoSec nerd, cannot allow insecure transmission of stuff that fits into any of the above criteria, so I'm out. Several of my fellow CISO nerds are doing the same and going to Microsoft Teams in GCC or GCC High. Some will have to stay with Zoom because Skype in GCC/High does not support PSTN (telephone shit) currently and presumably won't because PUBLIC is part of the acronym. 

It wouldn't surprise me if the US Gov't, at some point in the distant future because they move at a fucking glacial pace, mandates that contractors cannot use Zoom because of their shitty encryption. Unless Zoom gets their shit together soon, this shit is going down hard. Like somewhere in the 70-90 range in the next few months. Even if they get their shit together, the bad PR combined with people like me pulling out are going to make their Q2 earnings lower, I think.

But what the fuck do I know I just do security shit I'm not a financial advisor.

ZM 5/15 $70-90p, premiums are stupid and that'll change tomorrow I'm sure

Presumably, at least from my direct interactions with stuff, this will mean MSFT will get more money. MSFT is just like the big gay mouse, they're not great companies to bet against and we know MSFT will ultimately land on the other side of this just fine and the stonks go up. The real question is when. LEAPS on MSFT may not be a bad play either.",2020-04-05 19:29:10

#[Bear](https://www.critterbabies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/baby-grizzly-bear-cubs.jpg) in mind that since the initialization of the crash, all large swings have happened the day after monthly options execution dates. This isn't some quad witch bullshit. This is obvious and factual.

   * 21FEB was proceeded by a $11 fall in SPY, down to its $218 low on 23MAR. 
   * 20MAR was proceeded by a month long rally up to Friday, which was the peak on SPY.
   * 17APR was the most recent OPEX date, and true to form, we saw a spectacular setup for another massive dump. [Island reversal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/islandreversal.asp) topping on SPY, with a new high set after the initial downturn.

Fed manipulation is something I didn't count on, but we're all aware of the new real bear enemy: JPOW.

I've got $150 SPY puts for 5/15, and I'm holding them until Tuesday 4/21 because they are nuclear white hot and melting a -66% loss in my portfolio. If there's an obvious and significant upturn on Monday, i'll be stopping the haemorrhaging earlier. It should be quite apparent on Monday what we're looking at based on futures trading, and I'm be prepared to hold them or get out. If we see even or calm trading on Monday, I'm going to hold to Tuesday.

As noted by other individuals earlier on, it seems like the Fed likes to force the market higher on Wednesday or Thursday, so I need to be out of the aforementioned puts before they get ground to dust by another stupid Trump tweet about some hopeful bullshit.

If we see a significant rise this week, the bear dump is going to be reset to after the election, and my idea of Trump's initial plan to keep the market up until after the general election is going to play out.

Remember: we were seeing signals of a market failure last year in August and September - Repo market failures, and rate inversions were hitting on a regular basis. I'd presumed the market would be propped up until after the election, but this COVID pandemic pushed that up a little bit.

Alright, my bad everyone. This last post was really lazy, and I realize that I had nothing in there this morning after waking up, and seeing 43 comments making fun of a shitpost I labeled as DD.

Edit: [Found a nice video of a person who agrees with my sentiment on YouTube. I am not associated with this individual.](https://youtu.be/0mrHETRc1Jg)

#LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN

The initial post had one image in it, and it was made apparent to me that it showed no actual information, after reading comments this morning.

[Here's the full image](https://i.imgur.com/NJ6gs2r.png) - It's SPY, on the one day, and we're focusing on the apparent downturn on Friday.

The reason I'm saying this is going to be a downturn, is because this sentiment is shared with multiple other stocks in the S&P and elsewhere:

[Here's AMD in the same time period with no settings changed.](https://i.imgur.com/lSDnSmv.png) It appears further along in its downturn.

[Here's Visa with the same downturn potential.](https://i.imgur.com/BjVeGPA.png)

[Here's Microsoft](https://i.imgur.com/SK0YdlV.png)

[Here's Apple](https://i.imgur.com/0BFDaR2.png)

[Here's GM](https://i.imgur.com/bwoVCcW.png)

[Here's JPM](https://i.imgur.com/YoY0QNK.png)

[Here's GS](https://i.imgur.com/r6Jqjc4.png)

What originally got me taking a look at this is the gobsmacking nature of the market, and the ""how could this possibly be up right now"" ideation which everyone has. I started taking a look at downward trends, and tried it from a week out. The key answer is: It's not. On a weekly basis, the market sentiment [is absolutely down, and appears to be falling like a rock](https://i.imgur.com/FjQST1e.png)

There's nothing really substantial about the MACD settings I have in here. They're a little more sensitive close in, and I prefer Exponential over Wilders because It seems to better predict significant movements.

[When drawing support lines](https://i.imgur.com/jwbMUc4.png), taking into account the high, and moving toward the low with the opposite channel, there's a definitive direction taking place. The lower bollinger is midway through the channel, with the low indicating SPY ~190.

[The four hour MACD has already crossed as of Tuesday (March 31st)](https://i.imgur.com/jPURern.png), and once the daily follows, which I am presuming it will, things are going to go down significantly. I'm envisioning an opposite reaction with at least the same force as the [bull trap which was set up here.](https://i.imgur.com/Ktmgr6v.png)

Taking a look at the scale, and time on the daily, it appears that by next Friday, SPY is going to be following its 4 hour downward. It could be even closer if the oil talks do not go well. If they do, this sentiment may be pushed off until the following week.

I do not recommend anybody hold calls for outside next week. I do not recommend that anyone hold stocks past next week, unless they're ~~bull~~(bear, I meant bear fuck...) ETFs.

To explain my sentiment, we're seeing decreasing volume on most stocks. I presume this is because everyone is of the same mind: this bull trend doesn't make sense. We're going to see more COVID deaths, company production is halted, and nothing is being manufactured. There's no way for cash injections to buoy a market which is literally producing nothing. Further, the price of oil will not either. The weekly sentiment is strong down, the 4 hour is peaking down, and this is across the board on all the stocks I've listed above. SPY will eventually follow the separate stock trends, and we're going to see some amazing losses.

Suggested positions:

   * [AAPL - 180p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/pYKw3fD.png)
   * [AMD - 30p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/IIZYdVp.png)

   * [DIS - 70p? 65p? 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/PMU1DfA.png)

   * [GS - 100p - 1MAY20](https://i.imgur.com/3k2IW9G.png)


On Ally - they're probably going to go bankrupt. Most of their business is auto loan servicing, something no one has any interest in paying when they're going to need food and need to pay rent. Further, the federal government has had no discussions about auto loan bailouts. I looked into their 10k which was released in Feb, and 5/6ths of their loans are for cars. Further, 40% of those loans were made to people with a sub-700 credit rating. They have been getting into the mortgage game, but it's a modicum of their portfolio. I don't think they're making it out of this year alive.

We're seeing a pattern here right? All of those images above - The sentiment across the market is clear: we're plumbing depths, and you almost can't fuck this up. Buy a put, make sure the strike price makes sense a little bit, and get. dat. cash.

#OH, one last thing

I know he said he wasn't planning on it. I know that Trump has said he will not close the market, however I would say that closing the market would probably be in the country's best interest. I want you to think about that when you're buying close-in puts: there's a potential for the market to be closed, and if the market isn't open on exercise day, the option expires worthless. If I were Trump, I would be considering it. If I were an investor, I would also take this into consideration.

That would imply a death toll in Wuhan of about **42,000** — or **16 times the official number.** Another widely shared calculation, based on Wuhan’s 84 furnaces running nonstop and each cremation taking an hour, put the **death toll at 46,800.**

Now those who are slightly more intelligent than paint chip eaters would think, well, people die out of ""natural"" or other causes, right? Well yes, but **NOT this fucking many.**

* According to Wuhan Census and Statistics Department, Wuhan on average has **4,100 deaths per month in 2018**

[Source (Chinese - Wuhan Govt)](http://m.xinhuanet.com/hb/2019-03/26/c_1124281764.htm)

So that's way more than **10x official number (42k - 46k vs 4.1k)** for you - and counting. So yeah if you think New York being the next Wuhan is not that bad, maybe think again.

For background I am a former employee of a family run funeral home in Brooklyn NY. I currently am a police officer with the NYPD. My brother currently works at the same funeral home I was employed at. He has been working day and night while this whole COVID-19 has been going on. They currently have so many funerals going on that they are turning business away which is unheard of in the funeral industry. Not only that guys who do trade work (embalming of bodies to be put on display when a funeral home outsources the embalming process to an outside vendor) has been turning business away because of the influx of bodies going down here in NYC. I honestly feel SCI is worth a look by people that have much more knowledge on how stocks work then I do. Funerals yes typically have viewings which cost more money and add to revenue but the amount of people going down is high and I feel personally SCI will benefit from just funeral processing in general wanted to know if anyone has any input.

I like to share something I use and observe each week with this community. If you are a sole stock picker (per se), let me save you the time and tell you this post is pointless to read. Move on. 

First are foremost. as most of you know, volatility is a bitch. And like a bitch, it can be expensive. Trust me, I'm a little bitch and I''m expensive, or so says my boyfriend's girlfriend.

But the term ""expensive"" depends on what lens you look through. If you say, ""It's expensive relative to history."", then yes; this tends to be the lens most I speak with look through. However, I prefer to say, ""It may just be inline with financial conditions."" I'll further argue this from a bull and bear point of view.

I am not going to drag this post out with explanations and definitions. I will provide link(s) so you can do your own research. I'll ask myself seemingly smart questions, provide logical answers, and likely post loss porn by the end of Q2. For those who wish to know my position and don't give a shit about the rest of this post, scroll down to the end. 

**I believe the single best indicator of financial market conditions, i.e. the health of the financial system, is** ***The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's National Financial Conditions Index****.* 

[Here is the background to the NFCI](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/data/nfci/background). Within this, you can find a list of indicators which are used within the formula to derive its value. 

***Laymen: the more negative the NFCI, the looser financial conditions; positive values mean tighter conditions. Fed likes it loose right now. Powell was new and he was tight, then Trump grabbed him by the...***

What the fuck does this have to do with the price of the options you ask? **81% of the time, implied volatility across four assets correlates to the movement of the NFCI**. Those four assets are: 

1. S&P 500 (VIX), 
2. EUR/USD proxy FXE (EVZ), 
3. 10Y UST Note Futures (VXTYN) and,
4. Gold proxy GLD (GVZ).

&#x200B;

Here is the breakdown of correlation by each, and the average of the four IV indexes:

&#x200B;

**NFCI lags, which does not make it a predicative indicator.** That is bad news. However, NFCI is not very volatile over history, which means it trends pretty well. Good news.

&#x200B;

[Same as two charts above, but IV Index Averages Only](https://preview.redd.it/vnuvp791hbr41.png?width=1229&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e5ed7ee4dced41a37fba0c3a65743b4f5a5f2c7)

&#x200B;

Let's talk about downfalls. For one, the period of data is very limited. Number two, the VIX carries much more weight within the average of the four given it is, historically, the most volatile of the implied volatility indexes. This could mean the average may not budge much with the explosion of IV in EUR/USD (FXE) or USTs (in 10Y note futures). Third, as mentioned before, you cannot predict much with this.

So what do I use it for? As someone who is primarily macro, US (ec)centric, I observe it as a measure of how I choose to ""play"" options. **In other words, is my options book net debit or net credit.**

**What are the values telling me at present? As of the latest reading, options are expensive. But this simple view is derived from the average, which is weight more so the the VIX.** It could be argued that as financial conditions worsen (presumably given indicators), implied volatility is, at worst, slightly elevated, but likely in line. I'll explain further in by bull and bear arguments.

A better way to visualize could be take current implied volatility index readings and divide it by its historical 10 year average. When plotted against NFCI, you can better see how the average (of the four implied vol indexed) relates to NFCI values. Doing this improves correlation slightly, to 0.83. The green line represents the 10 year average, where the red line represents double the average. 

&#x200B;

[Visually, an easier way to identify implied volatility levels compared to average, relative to NFCI values](https://preview.redd.it/ed12arq5hbr41.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=c830d6e199d99f61112d74101b0c4acbfd8c2e15)

&#x200B;

To put this into numbers, over the past 10 Years, the VIX average is 17.09, EVZ 9.64, VXTYN 5.44, and GVZ 16.93. As of the latest readings, VIX is 267% above its average, EVZ +36%, VXTYN +78%, GVZ +129%.

The following ***Bull and Bear Arguments*** are from a more-equity (SPX) perspective. However, it also takes into account a bull and bear perspective on implied vol, where a bull view is an option writer and a bear view is an option buyer.

With that, the ***Bull Argument*** is quite clear: financial conditions are worsening, however the Federal Reserve actions are likely to work as they have in the past, and at worst, implied volatility levels will continue to fall, moving ever so closer to trend(line). The Fed's action may soon improve financial conditions, implying that options are very expensive. Seems like buy writes would make the most sense, observing from a long-only standpoint. Also, put-writes or risk reversals.

The ***(gay) Bear Argument*** is that the data provided only is for the past 10 years, does not display a recession, and the ""outlier"" readings may not be abnormal when the economic cycle is shifting, i.e. financial conditions are tightening. We are in the early innings of a cycle of de-risking and de-leveraging (likely, forced) and any calm that may come, where implied volatility gravitates towards trend(line), is an opportunity to buy options; puts, calls, debit spreads.

The trend I speak of refers to the linear trendline in my charts.

Last note: ***higher implied volatility does not equate to direction of price movement.*** Yes, for VIX, it tends to move higher when SPX is falling. But this does not have to occur. Another way of looking at this is to play the game of hindsight: if the average implied vol of the four assets were at all-time lows then ***long straddles and strangles*** would have been ideal as opposed to picking the direction of price.

I might update these charts as time goes on, depending on feedback, or lack thereof. I'm sure I'll have some edits along the way.

**Position: generally, bent over.**",2020-04-07 07:59:43
DD,"$DUST - tell me how this thing is not rigged, how is this thing alive???",21,fwdl6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwdl6m/dust_tell_me_how_this_thing_is_not_rigged_how_is/,17,1586260637.0,"TL;DR: the whole thing is the TL;DR version.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, have been following $DUST for a bit. Things are not great. It has been in the hole to the tune of -$30-$100MM (NOT A FRICKIN TYPO!!) for 10+ days now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Aside from being that deep in the hole, other tremendous things happening to it:

\- it has not been able to achieve exposure objectives on 3 of last, maybe, 15 trading days. thats coz it did not have the coin to buy the swaps it needed to do this. Deets at the end

\- fund management decided to change objective from 3\* to 2\* effective May 19th 2020 because they can't afford the swaps they need to get 3\* exposure. Thinking is that there isn't enough coin for 3\* but there should be enough for 2\*. Then corona showed up and they decided to accelerate that to EOD March 31st 2020. But they remain in the red. Again, deets at the end.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Decided to track daily holdings on this thing to figure out when it would die starting about 2 weeks ago. Here is a summary of what they look like over that period with the 5 day Yahoo chart right under it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/QsAostk.png](https://i.imgur.com/QsAostk.png)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

See that red row at the bottom, thats holdings as of today.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

¡¡¡¡THOSE NUMBERS MAKE NO SENSE!!!!

&#x200B;

$DUST WENT DOWN 10% TODAY SWAP HOLDINGS GO U \~ $30MM.

&#x200B;

THAT IS SOME CRAZY $&@%  !!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You are probably thinking, yeah, whatevs! You have no idea what you are talking about here.

&#x200B;

OK, lets drill into this a little bit.

&#x200B;

Here are holdings for the ETF categorized by type - Swaps, Treasuries and Cash for the same period

&#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/D2unhqD.png](https://i.imgur.com/D2unhqD.png)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That green column with the ""VANECK VECTORS GOLD MINERS ETF SWAP"" is where the funky stuff is happening.  Look at that last cell in darker green - $DUST goes down 10% and the swap gains 10%!!!! HOW?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This swap, which is designed SOLELY AND ONLY for the purposes of paying out when $DUST goes down, GAINED ALMOST $30MM IN VALUE TODAY WHEN $DUST WENT DOWN 10%

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Just compare any daily chart since March 19th 2020 with the swap; when $DUST drops, the swap loses value the same ratio.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It is simply not possible for the swap to go up when the ticker goes down. ITS' EXPRESS AND ONLY PURPOSE IS TO GO DOWN WHEN THE TICKER GOES DOWN! HOW DOES IT GAIN $30MM on 10% down day.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And its not a payout (buyout??) of the swap with cash - there is a drop of \~ $15MM in cash which simply moved from BoNY to Dreyfus. Its not the treasuries either, only about \~$6MM of flows there, not enough to cover the $30MM

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The ETF isn't shutting down! It won't die!!! ITS SWAPS MOVE UP ON DOWN DAYS!!! HOW!!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Help me believe that this game is not rigged.

DD,Insight into the CoVid data that nobody is talking about.,214,fwdiy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fwdiy9/insight_into_the_covid_data_that_nobody_is/,113,1586260381.0,"These are my claims from looking at the virus data myself:

1. The number of new cases US-wide is indeed plateauing. But don't get too bull happy. To be clear, this means that **the \*rate\* of new cases will no longer increase as we have seen**. This is a consequence of social distancing put in place \~13 March (24 days ago). Following the incubation period (4-12 range, mean 5) and duration of symptoms (10-14 days), this makes sense. Lombardi, Italy, began practicing social distancing around 28 Feb and the data shows that they also flattened the \*rate\* of new cases by March 18 (22 days).
2. **There is a medium-pace and steady descent in new cases once the rate plateaus**. Not groundbreaking, but at what rate does it descend? In Lombardi from 20 March to 06 April (17 days), the number of new cases per day dropped steadily from zero (plateau) to \~60%, specifically from \~2400 to \~1080 new cases per day. On a NY/US timeline, this means that the number of new cases per day will drop in NY from \~20,000 (the current plateau) to \~8,000/day and in the US from \~30,000 to \~12,000. In total cases that translates to \~250,000 in NY and \~800,000 in the US on 23 April. Bookmark this shit. My estimate 2 weeks ago was that the US would get between 400,000-700,000 cases. My estimate was too low.
3. Ahead I am going to explain what is probably the most important phenomena that virtually everyone overlooks when interpreting that virus data. **Number of new tests must be considered to interpret something credible from number of new cases**. **Hence, the steep drop of new cases that occurred over Sat, 04 April and Sun, 05 April was largely due to the coinciding drop in new tests.** Sites such as Johns Hopkins and World-meters do not include new tests, so autists and non-autists alike are  wrongly led to believe that the number of new cases nosedived.  I argue that it is because the number of new tests plummeted, not \*necessarily\* the number of new cases. The inverse is also true.  (To the naysayers, positivity rate is 45% in NY, so it follows that more people would test positive if more tests were readily available, and vice versa.)

Why is this significant? This is big, so stay with me. The number of reported new cases dropped from 23,101 to 18,659 from last Saturday to Sunday. That’s a 23% drop. Everyone looking at that leans optimistic and the bull parade is initiated. But-- \*There was concurrently a 19% drop in new tests. On Sunday night Trump tweets “light at the end of the tunnel”. The market rallies Monday morning 7%. **New tests are not properly being accounted for by the general audience to follow the new cases trend line.** The statisticians who know this are not explaining the nuances to the general public. Have you noticed how no statistical expert has declared an apex or plateau?

Still don’t buy it? The exact same scenario happened a weekend ago. There was a 15% drop in new tests from Sat-Sun and the market rallied 4% on Monday morning. The weekend before that? There actually wasn’t a significant drop in new tests; there was an increase over the weekend as US testing was ramping up. On Monday the market responded red. No new test reduction = no new case reduction = no green Monday.

My guess is that there is a logistic factor occurring over Saturday and Sunday to explain the drop in new tests over the weekend.

Further evidence--. Remember on March 24th when Trump said on the White House lawn that the country would be open in Easter. There was a 23% reduction in newly reported tests that day (and, of course, a -16% reduction in newly reported cases).

Last point then I have my final and practical takeaway. When the number of new tests/new cases drop, it shoots up the day and/or two. On Tuesday, March 31 new tests in NY increased 33% from the previous day. The SPY closed lower that Tuesday (-1.5%) and Wednesday (-4.3%) . Two days after trumps Easter comment, on March 26th, new tests day over day increased 53%. The Spy responded by dropping -3.6%.

&#x200B;

Follow the logic with me:

1. The SPY is corresponding to the number of new cases.
2. The number of new cases is corresponding to the number of new tests.
3. The number of new tests slumps occasionally ( I've observed a pattern of weekend slumping).
4. So, tests slump = cases slump = SPY moons

&#x200B;

The Corollary:

5) New tests revert to the mean after a slump, effectively bouncing back

6) Following (2) from above, daily new cases rise on a relative basis

7) SPY bleeds, because tests rally = cases rally = SPY diggs

&#x200B;

Bulls should play 1-4, bears play 5-7. Specifically, that means

BULL ACTION-- Load up on longs when the number of new tests shoots substantially above the mean because a drop in new tests/cases is likely 1-2 days ahead. Since weekends are days with lower new tests, Friday at 3pm works (assuming no bombshell news is reported over the weekend).

BEAR ACTION-- Short the market when the new tests drop, like right now, on Monday 4/6

Sorry I missed last week it was a wild one and I was pissed about the market in general. I have been watching this shit for a while. Here is what I think. No one here has any idea what the market is gonna do. No one anywhere has any idea! Remember when the market was gonna be red for the next 4 months? Bullshit. Just don't take everything you see on here as the fucking Bible because even the Bible is full of completely made up shit. 

&#x200B;

Congrats to Mr. Fuzzy Blankeet who is becoming a household name here on WSB. He has inspired multiple people to investigate companies in hopes of exposing their possible demise to the benefit of the rest of us. Honor and tendies await us.

&#x200B;

On to the DD I suppose. Today we are gonna start with oil. I have been seeing [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fux17s/buy_tanker_stocks_if_you_like_tendies/) after [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/furwfh/oil_to_crash_again/) describing opinions on where oil is gonna go an why. Short term; who the fuck knows. Long term; IT IS GONNA GO UP. Get this into your heads. The market is going to go up at some point. Options are for swings. They are for gambling. Buy some straight shares so you don't ruin yourself, please. DHT Holdings (DHT), Scorpio Tankers (STNG), Tsakos Energy (TNP), Frontline Ltd. (FRO) will probably all go up long term. However, because the Soviets and the Arabs are having a custody battle you need to watch for the entire industry going under. Shale in the US has trouble making any money when the price goes under $70 a barrel. Its a lot fucking lower than that. Shale and fracking companies in the US are going to go under. Chevron (CVX), Pioneer Resources (PXD), and Cimarex Energy (XEC) are all companies to watch. A fall is likely especially because the product is expensive. 

&#x200B;

Next, we have Lakeland Industries (LAKE). Another medical PPE company that is set to make money from the pandemic. They made good money during Ebola and will make good money during this. Earnings for the quarter ended January 31 are out April 15th. They are upping production, opening more factories, and already had ties with the US and the UK before this happened. Read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fulufx/potential_ppe_play_lakeland_industries_lake/) for a little more info about why its gonna go up. 

&#x200B;

The medical industry, in general, is going to go up from all the government spending.  Someone put together a list of a lot of medical companies that we can invest in or do options on. The [list is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fu9nc2/medical_companies_in_the_sp_500/) and can be a lot of help for people that are looking for plays. 

&#x200B;

The fed hates China, I hate China, I hope everyone hates China. I won't get into why but know that we do not like them. The fed wants to stop Huawei from using our tech in their shit. Huawei is already like a damn tech/spy branch of the Chinese government. This means that the US does not want our tech in their products because we do not want their shit to be effective. To combat this the government is deciding whether or not they should make it so that anything with US origin can not be sold to Huawei. Companies affiliated with Huawei will take a major hit from this, most notably NeoPhotonics (NPTN) who derives more than 45% of their total profits from Huawei themselves. American companies affiliated with Huawei will see a drop in profits if the decision goes through. 

&#x200B;

Finally, I have out knowledge of the day which is [how to do taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgfr97/taxes_how_to_treat_those_sweet_tendie_gains/) so the IRS doesn't bust down your door, shoot your dog, and have their way with your ass and wallet.

&#x200B;

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

&#x200B;

DD,Stocks only go one direction (Mr. Hyde's side of the coin),24,fw4i94,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw4i94/stocks_only_go_one_direction_mr_hydes_side_of_the/,23,1586227918.0,"Bulls are fukkkkk. While stocks may appear to be moving in an upward trend, reading between the headlines paints a picture too bleak for most people to consider. Virus numbers are counted incompetently at best, and fraudulently at worst. Our country’s historical corporate juggernauts are burdened by unimaginable debt (thank you for pointing this out, Fuzzy), and our economy was shut down so fast, some business owners still think they will be opening up again in a few weeks.

This pandemic is a mess. Long before Bill Gates gave his infamous 2015 Ted Talk, George Bush read a book about the 1918 Spanish Flu during his presidency. It terrified him, and he used his influence to create a plan for when the next pandemic would strike. He invested billions into the project, and even did “germ games.” Well, after H1N1 happened with a .2% death rate, the supplies failed to be replaced (thanks Obama) and the project was put on the back burner by both of the following presidents. As a result, we have found ourselves made into scared little bitches holed up in our houses, too scared to even go on a walk. The “tests” we are using today are inaccurate up to 50% of the time. When Dr. Scarf tells you that only 90% of all tests are positive, she is failing to mention that false negatives are a real problem. Now maybe this wouldn’t be such a big deal, but these shitty tests are also being used around the world. And there aren’t even enough of the tests to actually monitor the whole disease. It would actually be more accurate to think about the tests as a sample size of a study (positive rates / total tests) than an actual representation of how many people are infected in our country.

This brings me to the number of deaths. Did you know that France only counts a Covid-19 death if it happens in a hospital? In our own glorious country, if someone dies from a respiratory failure but failed to get tested first, they are counted as a death due to respiratory failure and not Covid-19. Now, if tests were abundant and universally produced 15 minute results, this would not be a problem. But as you may have already deduced, this is a major problem. You see, it is reasonable to conclude that while the total cases and deaths appear to be going down in all of our official records, the REAL number of cases and deaths is still increasing exponentially.

In a question: What if the datasets we have are only capable of growing linearly, while the virus is growing exponentially?

You may ask yourself, “So what if the world is fukkkk? These companies have crazy amounts of money and can get more thanks to unlimited liquidity. Recession is cancelled LOL.” This is fine and all, but have you happened to read Fuzzy’s posts on corporate bonds? To summarize his absolute brilliance, a lot of companies that you never think about have been issuing bonds to pay their debts. When bonds come due, they just issue more bonds to pay for it. Fast forward a decade, and you have companies like Ford, where they made just 50 million in net revenue but also just got downgraded in their lending score to junk bonds. I’m not nearly smart enough to put all the pieces together, but their massive debt load with brand new higher interest rates is about to sodomize their measly remaining profits. And this is just the beginning. Less business from people staying home means more bonds and less equity. I don’t have nearly enough to time to look at every company’s credit agreement, but the ones I have looked at seem really sketchy. Big numbers are coming due in the next 2-3 years, but there is a tiny amount of equity left to leverage. 

Small businesses are getting bent over and shown whose really the boss. As a small business owner myself, I thought the whole 10k advance loan you don’t pay back (paid within 3 days of applying), and anything else up to $2 million was a bit of a stretch. And then the PPP loan where you get a massive amount of money forgiven was also announced, and that was just too good as well. But then Mnuchin went on TV and actually said point blank that people will get funded the same day they apply, starting on April 3rd. Well, you can bet your sweet gay ass they fucked this up. Not only did NOBODY get funded (search “SBA” on twitter and it will remind you of searching ""just laid off"") but the banks straight up rebelled. BoA didn’t open applications until halfway through the day, Wells Fargo flipped the bird and said they were only going up to $10 billion in loans (and they had already hit that number), and my own personal bank didn’t even let me apply until this morning. Furthermore, a LOT of people have called SBA, and they are now saying the 10k grant will be based on your number of employees, and your money won’t get there for another 2-3 WEEKS. Oh yeah. This is going exactly according to plan.

So sure, the stocks are trending up right now while the retarded bulls circle jerk each other and fantasize about the “V shaped recovery.” Meanwhile, anyone with a warped gay mind can see the news is fake, the numbers are fake, and the real crash is imminent.

DD,Stocks only go one direction,2,fw3izn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fw3izn/stocks_only_go_one_direction/,23,1586224748.0,"The long term trend of the stock market is likely going to be sharply up, given that the government is controlling the market, the virus numbers are continuing to slow, and the current trend in the market.

Big government is controlling the market, which is seen the Fed’s utilization of its various tools. For example, JPow has unlocked unlimited QE, giving the banks all the liquidity that they need throughout this crisis. There will be no instances of banks running out of money in this crisis, which means no run on the banks. This means the banks have almost no risk and will have government backed loans added to their balance sheets. This is all augmented by the stimulus checks that will be hitting the average American’s bank account in a couple weeks, compliments of big government.

All of this would be futile, except that the big picture is starting to look up. Worldwide new Covid-19 cases are down as of yesterday, from 80 to 70k. In addition, the global number of deaths has also dropped from 6k to <5k. This dataset has led to headlines coming out of Norway that the government has everything under control. Georgia has taken the symbolic step of opening up its beaches, Washington State has sent 400 ventilators back to the government, and NYC has reported a 50% reduction in hospitalizations. Furthermore, UPenn has just announced a third vaccine that is about to enter Phase 1 clinical trials. With these reports circulating the globe, as well as oil prospects looking up, there is no longer evidence that the virus will cause a longer term impact on the stock market. It may take a while for main street to catch up, but the long term picture is increasingly optimistic.

All of the above has made a powerful impact on the market’s current trend. On SPY, the MA (10 close 2) is now looking up in the daily and hourly views. The RSI has risen to 56, and still has plenty of room to grow. The price action has held strong at 250, with a powerful push up to nearly 263 at the time of this writing. While previous action does not dictate future moves, there is a mountain of evidence demanding review that says these moves are the natural consequence of both natural and government-driven events. This all points to an upward action, which may see a complete recovery as early as late April.

It is difficult to draw any conclusions with a beast as unpredictable as the stock market, but it is clear that government manipulation of both the markets and the reported virus numbers have created a trend in the market that is likely to move numbers into an upswing. While these numbers may not reflect reality, it may also be time to accept that stocks go whichever direction the government wants them to go.

2) They are a Canadian company that earns primarily USD. With a strong dollar, they should actually be benefiting from all of this.

3) This will likely be their strongest quarter to date since they have their RIPET facility fully operational as well as their strongest seasonal quarter.

4) All of this considered and their share price has halved since this started.

Now that curve is flattened and healthcare workers got extra time to prepare, at great cost to economy, it's time to get back to work. It sucks being a healthcare worker these days but once the peak of infectious disease is reached any extra precautions that affect economy is hard to justify. The purpose of flattening the curve is twofold: **1. reduce** the peak to not run out of supplies and ventilators. **2. delay** the peak so that healthcare facilities have time to prepare. 

&#x200B;

**This is what flattening the curve does not do: reduce the number of the people who get the disease.** The measures we took simply **delay** the individual getting infected. The effect those measures have on the total number of people getting the disease is negligible unless we keep these measures for another 1.5 years. That is when the vaccine can be developed, manufactured, distributed, AND administered to people. Most people don't realize that **flattening the curve does not change the area under the curve.**

 

Now that the peak has been reached in NYC (financial center of the world) we have to take a sober look at how we can operate for the next 1.5 years. Continuing the current measures beyond third week of April will cause more harm due to unemployment, suicide, depression, domestic violence, substance abuse and other diseases. Can we keep restaurants, airliners, theme parks, and other significant parts of the economy on lock down for a disease that is 2-5 times more deadly than regular seasonal influenza? Is covid mostly expediting mortalities that would have happened in the coming years?

ALLEGED FACT:  [Using the RSI, the S&P retests its lows 28 days later (median)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canaccords-dwyer-expects-market-retest-221658700.html)

FACT:  28 days after 03/23/20 is 4/20/20.  FOUR-TWENTY!  It's destiny!!

FACT:  2,792 is a 50% retracement level.  I'm not saying retracement working is a fact.  I'm saying 2,792 is the 50% retracement level.

We're basically at 2,792 now so it seems like a great time to switch to puts expecting a retest of 220 on or around 4/20/20.  So what do we buy?

Well, we don't want theta decaying us in the ass so when we sell these puts since we're not holding to expiration, we want 30-45 DTE.  45 days from 04/20/20 is 06/04/20.  That means 06/19/20 expiration or 06/30/20 expiration.  

Personally, I'm taking the 06/30/20 because I want extra time for this to happen just in case the market isn't so easy that some random guy can make money this easily.

**CONCLUSION:**. 240p 6/30 with the intention of selling once SPY hits 220 or maybe 228 because the retest would come within 4%.    I could do a 230p but I'm worried full retest won't happen because of Powell doing Powell things so I want my strike closer to being ITM right now.

They're selling for ~$9.00 each now and I'm hoping to sell ~$27.00.

A sudden test of the low may help drive IV back up so the time premium when I sell could be higher than it is now even though the VIX is pretty high already lol

**EDIT:**  The market is forward looking.  Right now, the next thing is ""The virus has peaked and we can start thinking about when the economy opens again"".  But on 4/20, that will be old news and the next thing will be ""The virus has peaked and started opening the economy and this place is not going to open overnight""",2020-04-07 20:39:48

Lots of poor people now during the pandemic since they lost jobs and guess what, poor people gotta eat and ain't no cheaper fast food than this place (check out Taco Tuesdays).

52 w high at 13.50 and 52 w low at 2.45.  Current price as of this post is 3.40.  Pre-pandemic it was around 8.

Given that they are STRONGER during the pandemic than before it, it should actually be around 8.

Also, they got insider buys and recent passive stakes by some big funds (Russell Investments Group).

Consider also that they really have no competition anymore.  All those mom-and-pop taco places are fucking dead, out of business.  Del Taco standing strong here and taking away all their fat fuck customers.

Lastly, their ticker name is fucking awesome.

Muddy Waters Research (aka [short activist Carson Block](https://www.muddywatersresearch.com/about/)) released a now-famous [anonymous report](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1223274746017722371) on $LK on January 31st claiming that Luckin Coffee was committing accounting fraud and straight up fabricating transactions.

It took almost two months, but LK finally dropped and has gone from trading at $37 prior to the report to now $4.39 and will likely be both delisted and subject to a class action lawsuit.

Enter $IQ, the [Netflix of China](https://wolfpackresearch.com/iq-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/). [Muddy Waters is today reporting](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/1247534498939465731) that iQIYI is committing a few different kinds of fraud:

* They've inflated their 2019 revenue by somewhere between 27%-44%
* They've overstated their user numbers by 42%-60%
* They've inflated their expenses, the prices it pays for content, and other assets and acquisitions in order to hide the revenue they don't have

The problem with overstating your revenue is the money has to be somewhere, so you're stuck with also overstating expenses. This gives researchers two points of attack to figure out if your financials are accurate: the revenue side and the expense side. Muddy Waters has found evidence of serious fraud on both ends.

[Full report here](https://wolfpackresearch.com/download/iqiyi-the-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/).

It took $LK 2 months or so to seriously drop, but it's my belief in the wake of their nosedive that accusations of Chinese firms with serious accounting issues will accelerate and we'll see much faster price action in the next week on $IQ. 

If you disagree, buy longer dated puts. Check IV before purchasing.

**edit 1**: IQ rallied hard after the news and many short-sellers were squeezed out in the afternoon. We're tracking down 3% against afterhours. 

TAL, another Chinese firm with accounting accusations from Muddy Waters [just announced](https://twitter.com/StockJabber/status/1247624762936999936) they fired an employee who had been inflating their sales. TAL stock is down 20% afterhours on that news.

Now, we're looking at shit earnings for at least for the next 2-3 quarters, around 10-20% of the S&P 500 becoming insolvent, depression level unemployment, possible lockdown cycle for the next year or two, a huge supply and demand shock, etc..., but apparently JPow printed the recession away.  At this point, even JPow has to be looking at the Nasdaq, which is now trading at a ""CNBC once in a decade"" buying opportunity last seen since...December of 2019...and thinking, ""fuck, maybe I did print too much money?""

Bulls are already to type ""Markets are forward looking.""  The Nasdaq lost about 75% of if it's value from 2000 to 2001, if the market was perfect we wouldn't be going up and down like a penny stock.  The market is breathing a sigh of relief that there's no liquidity crisis, and the fed can buy all the shitty bonds and do all the QE it wants, but it can't solve a solvency crisis where tons of these companies are essentially going to go broke.  It doesn't take all that much to start a recession, your wife's boyfriend loses some hours at work, you don't get a raise, all of a sudden everyone tighten's their belt and a recession is here, and we have that on absolute steroids right now.  The checks and PPP don't help if there's no where to spend it and no one comfortable with spending money, just look at Japan.  So what explains the recent price action?

I'm gonna steal this from Nomura's quant desk as to the recent price action:

""The steep rally in global equities looks to us like a “bear squeeze” rally, powered by exits from bearish positions that investors accumulated during the downturn. Investor sentiment does seem to be finding support in signs that the virus’s spread in Europe and the US is on course to peak and start slowing, but this was already set to be a week in which CTAs were likely to back out of short positions in US equity futures, so we think it is best to assume that the rally is largely technically driven. It is not clear yet whether the market gains will hold up once the bear squeeze has run its course. We think that projecting scenarios based on longerterm fundamentals onto the present market is something best avoided. The squeeze on CTAs’ short positions has been led by speculative investors recently making contrarian trades, and here we would single out absolute return funds and eventdriven funds, both of which favor short-term trades with a strong element of seizing on opportunities. It appears to us that a powerful wave of contrarian trades by quickmoving investors such as these has left trend-chasing CTAs without an incentive to stick with their short-term bear trades.

It may help here to look in detail at CTAs’ positions in US equity futures markets. We estimate that CTAs’ net short position as in S&P 500 futures is now about 20% smaller than it was at its 3 April peak. We think that the S&P 500 could rise to around 2,700 if CTAs were to exit their short position in its entirety. Similarly, we estimate that CTAs’ net short position in DJIA futures has shrunk by about 11%. Should CTAs continue being squeezed out of their short positions, we think the DJIA could rise to around 24,000. The pace of CTAs’ exits from short positions in Russell 2000 futures (RTY) has been especially swift. We estimate that their aggregate net short position here is already about 45% smaller than it was at the 31 March peak. Meanwhile, CTAs are still leaning long on NASDAQ 100 futures, as before.

It looks as though CTAs are being forced into unwinding short positions in equity futures markets across Europe. We estimate that CTAs’ net short position in the especially important DAX futures market is about 40% smaller now than at the latest peak. At the risk of repeating ourselves, however, the short-covering by CTAs that we are seeing has a strongly technical flavor. Given that the bottom is falling out of Germany’s real economy, we do not see much happening besides speculative players being ejected from bearish positions. It looks unlikely to us that the momentum behind CTAs’ exits from short positions will actually carry them into turning bullish. We also estimate that CTAs are in the process of covering short positions in most major agricultural commodity futures markets. They have already swung net long on CBT wheat futures and CBT soybean meal futures""

So that's a lot of words and half of you have no clue what the hell that means.  There's no fancy crayon lines, it's just a simple bull trap due to shorts covering.  Ackman was actually right with his CNBC bullshit, hell is actually still coming.

&#x200B;

A few things have changed since then, and it looks like people are bleeding out left and right. I figured it was time to add some fodder to the confirmation bias inferno here and update the thesis based on what I et al have found.

&#x200B;

The repo market, as I laid out in the last post, is an interbank loan market. It's the equivalent of going to the pawn shop to make rent, but for banks and other financial entities. Firms run close to the red, sometimes they need some quick cash to tide them over. Not necessarily because they're shitty, but just because they needed a few dozen million overnight.

&#x200B;

Late last year, the repo market froze up and overnight interest rates soared to 10%; we've since learned that this was because of a fuckload of crappy collateral posted by counterparties. Enter the fed with their repo injections, everything smooths over. 

&#x200B;

This crash was precipitated in part by fears of the virus and in part by a mad dash by firms to divest themselves of equity in order to remain liquid - this crash was, as most of you know by now, the result of a credit crunch.   


**Here's where the bear thesis is confirmed**

This rally, I think, has been spurred by a two different factors: firstly, institutional money began closing shorts near the bottom as the fed began launching moneybombs into the market (see wild chop on the second leg down); secondly, retail investors caught that pop and started pushing a trend. Because retail investors are fucking morons.

The fed repo injections have placed a bandaid over the liquidity problem by giving away money for free and buying garbage fucking assets.

&#x200B;

Longterm, though, and as many of you are already aware: the economy r fuk. Big fuk. Even if SPY goes to 420 because of inflation and fed buying stonks, *economy r fuk.* Some of you ball-tuggers are still of the opinion that once quarantine is lifted, all the millions of newly unemployed will have jobs to return to immediately and that a deluge of pent-up demand will shower retail and travel and hospitality and energy and what-have-you in unprecedented revenues. You are ***very, very wrong***. 

A lot of Americans are employed by businesses that run on razor-thin margins. Businesses that will go up in smoke over two months' lost revenue. Those jobs will not exist in a few months. What happens then? Retrenchment. Decreased consumer spending, *even after* the quarantine is lifted. What does decreased consumer demand do? Kill jobs. Who needs jobs? Consumers. Why? To service their debts.

Consumer debt in the US stands at some 14-odd trillion USD right now, and over $9T is in mortgage debt. Many governments have imposed moratoriums on rent and mortgages - this, again, is a bandaid, because it doesn't compensate landlords. Additionally, many banks are demanding lump sum settlement at the end of mortgage deferment. Good luck with that.  


K, now, everyone knows the average consumer is up to their eyeballs in debt. What about businesses, though? Businesses get credit, too. Well, yeah, that's actually one of the bigger problems here. As many of you likely have learned by following fuzzo's posts, businesses are leveraged as fuck on debt they'll never be able to service - especially if consumer demand is paralyzed for 6 months or more. A lot of the businesses that have mooned in the past few years are practically ponzi schemes, and a metric fuckload of US businesses have multibillion dollar debt maturity walls approaching in the next 3-5 years. 

Add to that the fact that, as businesses are downgraded, servicing their debt becomes more difficult and more expensive. So, firms that get downgraded are going to find it increasingly difficult to refi and kick their debt problem down the road. And S&P just reported that around $6.9T in corporate debt is about to get downgraded. All this is pointing to a **years-long bear market** as businesses collapse left and right over the next few years.

&#x200B;

And this doesn't even scratch the surface of all the bubbles we're in - auto lending, RRE, CRE, etc - or the oil war.

&#x200B;

Economy r fuk. Long $guns.

DD,Food for thought,34,fxkhxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fxkhxy/food_for_thought/,23,1586429665.0,"I’ve mostly been on the sidelines, and as some of you know, I am a bull, not a bear. I’ve made 5 recent bets. 

Shares of GS @ 150
Shares of JPM @87
Shares of DIS @ 88 
Synthetic share position in Wendy’s $11 strike expiring in August, entered for a net debit of .03 
SPY LEAPS for 12/2022 310 & 320 strikes 

Here’s the thesis: 

Goldman’s research article kicked off this shit show back in February. They are one of the smartest shops on the street, trading at a discount to book, and always seem to walk away unscathed.

JPM is probably the best run bank on the street, and the fact that they trade at a sizable discount to book is just insanity. Plus, never bet against Jamie. He’ll fuck your shit up. 

DIS is a net gainer, for several reasons. The obvious one is that pent up demand will give them a spike, when the world normalizes, but the more important one is Disney+. Because it’s recurring revenue? No. Because Disney is the best cross seller in the world. Every new subscriber represents a lot more than $7/month, when this is taken into consideration. And lastly, Disney is part of the Becky index, and we all know what happens when you bet against Becky. 

Wendy’s was absurdly cheap at $11. They just came out with breakfast, and we all know how well McDonald’s did with that. Also, fast food gets to stay open, and contrary to popular market sentiment, giving employees temporary raises in a time like this buys you a lot of good will. (For any of you autists that don’t know what a synthetic is, I sold the $11 put, and used the credit to buy the $11 call. When you do this on a red day, it costs almost nothing to enter the trade, giving you effectively a 100 share limit order and free upside in the stock.)

Lastly, SPY LEAPS are a great way to lever up. My position has a notional value of around 160k, and I only ponied up 9.6k. As long as you don’t run out of money to roll, buying as far out as you can and rolling these with 6 months to expiration yields a return that beats the hell out of basically everything.

Edit: For anyone curious, I’m still holding the SPY calls, and will roll at 6 months to expiration. I decoupled the Wendy’s position, selling the call off for $800, and am waiting for the put to expire, so I gain the whole credit of $283. I sold Goldman at $220, DIS at $125, and JPM at $112.

 [https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) 

It's by a group that was initially funded by the Bill and Malinda Gates foundation. It is predicting that the last death in the USA will be recorded around May 30th. Everybody can celebrate, buy the fuck out of their favorite stocks, and have one hell of a gay bull orgy fest on May 31st when the bars finally open.

And it's wrong. Here's my argument.

First, the model is based on recorded deaths in the USA. We know for a fact that recorded deaths is incomplete data. Basically, there is A LOT of evidence that there are people who died of pneumonia recently that have not been tested for the COVID-19. 

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/coronavirus-death-toll-americans-are-almost-certainly-dying-of-covid-19-but-being-left-out-of-the-official-count/2020/04/05/71d67982-747e-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/coronavirus-death-toll-americans-are-almost-certainly-dying-of-covid-19-but-being-left-out-of-the-official-count/2020/04/05/71d67982-747e-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html)

They stopped testing a lot of patients because there is very little healthcare value in doing so. The tests should be focused on people it can help. 

Garbage in, garbage out. The model isn't factoring in the hundreds or possibly thousands of deaths that haven't been confirmed. It also doesn't know about the thousands 

Second, unless we have sufficient testing, confirmed cases and deaths are meaningless. This is the opinion of Nate Silver. The guy who predicted before the 2016 election that Trump had a 33% chance of winning the election when everybody else said he had a 10% chance. 

[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-case-counts-are-meaningless/)

Third, if you download Nate's ""covidia"" excel model, and look at the default values for this model, you'll see that after the peak you have to wait 95 days before the virus effectively dies out (less than \~300 new infections, which is 30x the population of ""covidia""). That's with an anemic R0 value of 0.6 (meaning social distancing reduced how contagious the virus is by about 5X, which is pretty reasonable). 

We haven't seen a peak in detected cases. Even if it was last Saturday, according to Nate's mental exercise model,  we're still looking at July 4th before there are only 300 new cases. AND those 300 cases are still enough to start a new outbreak. Realistically, we need to wait a couple more weeks past the last confirmed case for it to die down.

Four, do you think the stupid fuck Trump is going to force you to stay home with ""only"" 500 confirmed cases in the USA? What about DeSantos who only closed Florida after there were 163 deaths and 8000 confirmed cases. Would he keep Florida closed with ""only"" a thousand non-recovered cases? Yeah, the lack of science in our politicians is going to fuck us. To stop a second wave, we have to stay in quarantine for weeks AFTER the last confirmed case. Basically, our politicians are spinless globs of cherry jello. 

Five, the second-third-fourth-fifth wave. If we don't wait long enough to open up and reverse social distancing, the R0 value goes back up. Even with contact tracing and all the titillating stuff South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have done, they still have an increase in cases. Contact tracing and lots of testing is not sufficient to drop the R0 value below 1.

 [https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) 

Six, you don't need a full lockdown to fuck our economy sixteen ways sideways. Our economy was 11 years into a bull run. The market was begging for a recession, but Donald Pump couldn't help but inject all his magic juice into his bubble for reelection. You get debt, you get debt, you get debt, EVERYBODY GETS DEBT. Debt doesn't create a strong economy. The stupid fuck doesn't realize that you can't just declare bankruptcy and the economy goes on hunky dory. 

There was WAY too much optimism in the economy. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's only bad if too many people are buying Mercedes on subprime refinances on their house. It's bad when people are spending $100k on credit or in subprime business loans to remodel a restaurant in the fucking mall.  

We're at the first wave of bankruptcies and business failures with the 2% increase in unemployment. The second and third and fourth waves are down the line, even if we could get back to work on May 30th. Delta and Lufthansa get this shit. There is a reason why they are putting planes in long term storage and grounding planes indefinitely. Hint: It's not because they think in 2 months they will be flying the same volume they were 2 months ago. Someone in their management has been through these shit storms and know it's going to last longer than the virus.

I'm almost certain what we got on this new bull run is a lot of money managers saying ""we hit the bottom, everything is ON SALE! We're going to have a V shaped recovery."" Money managers are basing those opinions on exactly 1/4 of their morning jizz stain. Listen to any economist and they say ""indicators say we got a V recovery coming."" More, they have no fucking clue. The reason, they don't base their opinions on Jizz. Instead, they base them on the indicators in the economy. And they simply don't have any data to point to a recovery.

Online furniture sales are jumping bigly. OSTK stock will follow. How do we know? 

1 - Wayfair already announced they're gonna have a killer quarter. If you don't know that already then GTFO and catch up on yesterday's news

2 - Overstock and Wayfair are interchangeable competitors. I've used them both. Both are just drop shipping markets for other brands, similar price range. Don't trust me? Just look at their websites. Same shit, same prices

3 - google trends. Look at trends for [buy furniture](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=buy%20furniture) or [buy couch](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=buy%20couch). Also look at [overstock](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=overstock). Its going up. People are shopping there.  

4 - extrapolating my own internal experience. As soon as I was forced into WFH quarantine I looked around and realized all of my furniture was shit. Stupid couch, ugly bookcase, and didn't even have a desk. I'm not alone here. People are stuck inside and need to spend money to feel better because they're addicted to consumerism. They can't spend on clothes, eating out, cars, and drugs, so they'll buy video games and furniture. 

Now normally I only do otm because I'm a degenerate gambler. But volume is low on this stock so I had to keep it boring. OSTK 5c 5/8

So am I worried? Not really. I'll share with you some of my DD and maybe you'll understand why.

-------

The latest headlines have been all about how COVID-19 is peaking in NYC and will soon be peaking in the US as a whole. [This is the model](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america) cited by the White House and is also the one most often mentioned by the media. It's been continuously revised down over the past weeks, from over 100k deaths, to 90k last week, to 80k Monday and now 60k today.

I won't go into its flaws (the most obvious one being the assumption that there will be no deaths post-June). Instead, I'll elaborate on one of its main assumptions: ""COVID-19 projections **assuming full social distancing through May 2020**"". Is America applying full social distancing right now?

#Exhibit #1: Google's Mobility Report

Google recently released [a fascinating report](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on the mobility behavior of various countries (based on anonymized tracking data as of March 29th). These reports compare how much time people are spending in different types of locations (retail stores, grocery stores, parks, transit stations, workplaces and their homes) compared to usual.

Here are the reports for [Italy](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_IT_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) and [Spain](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_ES_Mobility_Report_en.pdf). They look pretty similar, about a 85-90% decrease in traffic to retail, groceries, parks and transit stations.

Meanwhile, this is what [New York](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_New_York_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) looks like: -60% retail and transit, -30% groceries, -50% parks. And keep in mind, this is the hardest-hit state in America; states like [Florida](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_Florida_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) have even worse numbers.

My point here is that as of a week ago, [America as a whole](https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/2020-03-29_US_Mobility_Report_en.pdf) was not even close to enacting social distancing measures on the levels of Spain or Italy. And even if such measures were implemented **now**, it would take at least 2 weeks for their effect to be felt on the charts (look at how long Spain and Italy have been at -90% on their traffic before their numbers leveled off).

#Exhibit #2: Flight Radar

Not only is the US not doing social distancing right, it also hasn't done much to restrict interstate travel. Here's a very telling stat: [2/3rds of global flights on March 28th were above North America](https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/1244003511098134529). Think that has changed since then? Think again: here's [Europe + Asia + North Africa now](https://i.imgur.com/7etzRT5.png) (1200 flights total, top-left corner), here's just [the eastern states](https://i.imgur.com/hcDYc2T.png) (1500 flights, which is the maximum Flightradar can show on one screen).

What does this mean? It means that even the states which are implementing lockdowns and bending the curve now will have fresh new outbreaks as soon as they lift their measures. Air travel is the easiest way for the virus to spread via asymptomatic carriers and the only way to prevent this is a domestic travel ban. That doesn't look like it's gonna happen anytime soon.

**Edit:** all the geniuses saying ""BuT aLL ThE FLigHtS ArE EmPtY"" are completely missing my point. It takes a single superspreader crossing state lines to start a new outbreak. In my country, you need to provide paperwork if you want to leave the city and the police will check up on you to ensure you're quarantining. That's the kind of action needed to prevent new outbreaks.

#Conclusion

To me it seems very clear that a large majority of America's population will be contracting this virus over the next month and a half. Italy and Spain made enormous social sacrifices to stop the outbreak and their success is just now becoming apparent. As of right now America is not doing nearly enough to follow in their steps, so exponential growth should continue unabated.

How does this relate to my SPX puts? How the market responds to this is a topic for another time, but let me just say this: my puts might be down now, but that doesn't mean America is any less fucked.

This is some senior’s stock pitch from a few days ago, but I figured it was too good not to paraphrase and share with you fags).

TLDR for the retards: $SPY 4/20 $69P
# What’s an “Evercore”???
Evercore is a boutique investment bank, AKA a House of Chads that your wife visits while you're at work. In 2019, they were number 1 in advisory revenues and M&A volume among independent firms. **Their advisory market share among ALL FIRMS (including MS, GS, Citi, Merrill, etc.) has grown from 2% in 2010 to 8% in 2019.** Basically, these Schlomos have gone from being that one weird kid on the playground that none of the clients wanted to play with, to **stealing Goldman Jewberg's fucking latkas** from under his nose. But more on that later.
# Key Points
##### Their restructuring (RX) division is gonna kick ass in this downturn
In case you've been living in your mom's basement this entire time (wouldn't be surprised tbh), we are about to enter one shitstorm of a recession. Not only that, but companies are levered to the tits. ***Investment banking divisions at the Big Boy Shops (MS, GS, Citi, JPM, etc.) are gonna get fucked.*** You see, these big boys can't offset their declines in M&A revenues with RX like the boutiques can due to conflicts of interest. That's where EVR comes in. **In the last recession, their investment banking revenues were $300M in 2009 and $190M in 2008, even though M&A activity fell 25% and 40% in those years respectively because of their RX group.** If you look at their revenues vs. their public comps at the time (Lazard, GS, Greenhill), Evercore's revenues fell a lot less and grew way faster after the recession.
##### They are growing way faster and (this is important) *way more efficiently* than their peers
Evercore's revenue has exploded compared to their peers (Lazard, PJT, Moelis, Houlihan, Greenhill) since the recession. **What's crazy about Evercore is that they've done it while also expanding their operating margin.** In simpler terms - if you want the hotshots at an i-bank to bring in more dough (revenue growth), you usually have to buy them more hookers and blow (operating expenses). I don't know what kind of operating model (Epstein didn't kill himself) they’re using at Evercore, but it seems to be working. Revenue CAGR over the last 5 years is 20%, and EPS has grown at a CAGR of 25% since the recession. Crazy stuff.
##### They like to reward shareholders (hint: that means you!)
This one is geared slightly more towards the boomer doomers in r/investing, but could still support the stock if you’re autistic and want to buy somewhat longer-dated options on it. Over the last 5 years, **they've spent an average of $300M per year on buybacks and dividends, with $400M spent in 2019.** Why the fuck are these greedy i-banker Jews spending so much on buybacks??? Don't they want to dole out fat bonuses so that they can support their wives' swinger habits??? Great question - it's **because employees own a whopping 30% of the firm** (on a fully diluted basis). There's also a decent chunk of equity compensation among those Mossad bankers, and **over 98% of the restricted stock units are still unvested**, so these monkeys still have to pound the hamster wheel for a few more years. Good news for investors like us (that’s right – institutions own a shit ton of the company as well, way above average).
# WhAt aBoUt iT’s pEeRs???
Some of the savants in the audience might be quick to point out that Evercore's peers also have restructuring divisions. In fact, Houlihan Lokey (HLI) and PJT have a waaaayy bigger focus on RX than Evercore. 

Good point, but you are just the type of retard on r/investing that would say ""buy the stock, the company is gonna make mad profits this year cuz of X braindead reason that is already priced in 100x"". No shit, the market already knows this. These firms (HLI and PJT) are priced at 12-month P/Es of 21x and 55x, respectively, and Price-to-book ratios of 4x and 52x respectively. **Evercore is trading at a disgusting discount of 6.9x (LMAOO) P/E and 2.1x P/B.** Sure, you are getting *less of that juicy RX revenue,* but you are getting it *insanely cheaply*. And besides, when this is all over, they will continue to bully the shit out of those cucks at Goldman and the rest of J-Pow's harem.
# PoSiTiOnS???
Because most of you autists don’t do much besides jerk off to your wife getting plowed by her boyfriend and lose your money on FDs, you wouldn’t have the brainpower to come up with a way to capitalize on this DD. Well, I figure that if I’ve gotten this far in writing this fucking erotic novel of investment research for you cucks, then I might as well finish with the cumshot.
&nbsp;
**This DD leads me to conclude that this thing could hit at least $65 in the next few months.** It is currently at $53. The way to play this, from most to least autistic, is as follows:

1.	Buy $60 calls expiring this/next week. Don't do this. If you do this, fuck you, you deserve to lose your money.
2.	Wait for the “DiP” that every piece of TA around here has been saying is right around the corner for the past two weeks. EVR will probably tank with the rest of the market. When it hits, say ~$40 (or be a greedy bitch and wait for it to break the recent bottom of $33), buy $50-55 strike calls with 1M to expiry. Once the market finishes the ride down and J-Pow turns off the faucet, EVR will moon. 
3.	**Buy 6/19/20 $65 calls.** Don’t go way OTM, there’s basically no volume on the options, so you’re gonna need it to be ATM or ITM near expiry.
4.	**Buy 9/18/20 $65 calls.** Give yourself 3M more runway, retard.
5.	Just buy the fucking stock. This is a great opportunity to get into EVR (yes you, not just your wife on the weekend) at a cheap(er) valuation. Given their history of buybacks and dividends, as well as their growth and cheap valuation, you will (probably) make money.
