So how can you avoid throwing away your kiddies college fund to fulfil your gambling your habit? Well I'm going to try and teach y'all, autist to autist, how to make tendies like u/haput91 makes me-me's and avoid being the next u/analfarmer2. The stonks market awaits!

Note:>! If you think I'm wrong, fuck you. We're all autists and someone has to explain to these degenerates what a stonk is. Go watch Rick and Morty if your IQ isn't too low.!<

Idea 1: What the hell is this guy talking about?

Calls/Buys:>! A bet that the stonk will go up to a certain point !<

Puts/Sells>!: A bet that the stonk will go down. !<

Bulls: >!Einsteins who believe stonks only go up! !<

Bears: >!Newtons who believe stonks will always go down! !<

Point 27: Gimmi those tendies!

So how are we gonna avoid spending little Jimmies college fund? 

First of all we're gonna stop using options. Instead of Calls&Puts use Buys&Sells. You still feel great when you win tendies but instead of loosing 100% on an expiring call you loose 3%, meaning you can make the same mistakes again and again without taking out a third mortgage!

Next? 

That's literally it. All you bulls going GUH as TSLA doesn't stay at $420 would be saving so much $$$ if you just used Buys instead of Calls. Now go inverse whatever I say I'm doing and find out what leverage is for yourself.

12,DD,War and Geopolitical crises can be Counterintuitive: Buy Calls,0.9998,ejmypd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ejmypd/war_and_geopolitical_crises_can_be/,22,1578119518.0,"U.S. airstrikes in Iraq have killed one of Iran's most powerful generals, striking fear into the geopolitical realm. No one knows what exactly this means at the moment, but there is fear of escalating tensions in the Middle East, along with the potential for retaliation and further conflict.

Markets reacted accordingly as [oil and gold prices shot up](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/02/investing/oil-prices-iran-commander-baghdad/index.html) while the [stock market fell](https://www.wsj.com/articles/geopolitical-tensions-put-brakes-on-global-stock-rally-11578038726) and interest rates declined. Market prognosticators have an old rule of thumb that investors hate uncertainty more than anything, and there are few situations more uncertain than the threat of war.

But markets don't always care about rules of thumb, and uncertain situations don't always play out in stocks as many would have you assume. The relationship between geopolitical crises and market outcomes isn't as simple as it seems.

In the six months following the onset of World War I in 1914, the Dow fell more than 30%. Because the war basically ground the business world to a halt and market liquidity all but dried up, the decision was made to close the stock market that year. This lasted for six months, the longest such period on record. Making up for lost time, the Dow rose more than 88% in 1915 after it reopened, which remains the highest annual return on record for the DJIA. In fact, from the start of the war in 1914 until the war ended in late 1918, the Dow was up more than 43% in total or around 8.7% annually.

World War II had a similarly counterintuitive market outcome. Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, setting off the war. When the market opened on September 5, the Dow shot almost 10% higher that day. When the attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor occurred in early December 1941, stocks opened up the following Monday down 2.9%, but it took just a month to regain those losses. When the allied forces invaded France on D-Day on June 6, 1944, the stock market barely noticed. The Dow rose more than 5% over the ensuing month.

From the start of WWII in 1939 until it ended in late 1945, the Dow was up a total of 50%, more than 7% per year.

So, during two of the worst wars in modern history, the U.S. stock market was up a combined 115%.

The Korean War began in the summer of 1950 when North Korea invaded the South. That conflict ended in the summer of 1953. In that time, the Dow was up an annualized 16%, or almost 60% in total.

U.S. troops were sent to Vietnam in March of 1965. The Dow would finish the remainder of that year up almost 10%. By the time the last of the U.S. troops were pulled out of Vietnam in 1973, the stock market was up a total of almost 43% in that time, or just under 5% per year.

The Cuban Missile Crisis had the world on the brink of nuclear war in October of 1962 when the U.S. faced a standoff against Russia. The confrontation lasted 13 days. In that two-week period, the Dow remained surprisingly calm, losing just 1.2%. For the remainder of that year, the Dow would gain more than 10%. Veteran trader Art Cashin [tells the following story](https://ritholtz.com/2017/08/cashin-cuban-missile-crisis-north-korea/) about the advice he received from a seasoned trader during the Cuban Missle Crisis as he was worried about the impact on stocks:

*Jack said – “Look kid, if you hear the missiles are flying, you buy them. You don’t sell them.”*

*“You buy them?” I said, somewhat puzzled.*

*“Sure you buy them!” said Jack. “Cause if you’re wrong, the trade will never clear. We’ll all be dead.”*

The terrorist attack on U.S. soil on Sept. 11, 2001 saw stocks fall sharply, down almost 15% in less than two weeks following the tragedy. The economy was already in the middle of a recession at that point, and stocks were in a free fall from the bursting of the dot-com bubble. But within a couple of months, the stock market had made back all of the losses that occurred in the aftermath of 9/11.

The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003. Stocks rose 2.3% the following day and finished up the year with a gain of more than 30% from that point on. Although it is important to note these gains were coming off the brutal 2000-2002 bear market.

The point here is the market's reaction to war and geopolitical crises can be counterintuitive. It's always difficult to know how investors will react to certain events because so much of the market's reaction to these events is context dependent.

I have no idea what this Iran conflict will mean for the world at large, but even if you knew exactly what the headlines would be in the coming months on this issue, it probably wouldn't help you from an investing perspective. Markets don't always respond to geopolitical events the way you think.

This thing has 60% short interest, I have literally never seen something so likely to go tits up in my life.  On monday I will be opening a position in this stock for after earnings for a couple reasons.  

1.  I exercise a good amount and literally cannot escape Peloton ads.  They are everywhere I go from my gym, around my gym, on pandora all the time, youtube, reddit, literally everywhere.  I have never even googled their products or anything.  At most I may have googled their stock ticker once or twice, but I get tons of ads from supplement places and stuff like that, but Peloton is by far the biggest one.  

Tldr: they are dumping money into advertising, especially for the christmas season

Also, someone on here posted that his Peloton system was down from server overloads, aka, literally too many people are using it and overloading their system.  This means they sold significantly more than they anticipated as well.  

Plus they have a solid business model with selling equipment and subscriptions.

The same company runs another EFT called **$SDS**. This is, you guessed it, the SPY Double $SHort. It's just **$SH with a 2x multiplier**. Unsurprisingly, there are more options available for $SDS than $SH.

But because people suck at pricing options, **$SDS puts are way cheaper than $SPY calls**, and vice-versa. For example, as I'm writing this (2am Eastern on Jan 6 2020):

Jan 10 **SDS PUT** for $24.00 is $0.04. That's 3.10% OTM for **$0.04**.

Jan 10 **SPY CALL** for $327.5 is $0.20. That's 1.55% OTM for **$0.20**.

These two options are equivalent, but the SDS PUT is cheaper. Sure, the bid is currently $0.00, but even at the ask price of $0.08, the **$SDS PUT is less than half the cost of a regular $SPY call**.

This is true for most OTM SPY/SDS option pairs. But when either option goes ITM, **$SDS gains 2x the amount of intrinsic value, since it's a double-short of $SPY**. Exercising the SDS option is better, provided there's volume, and SDS averages 4 million shares/day. That makes up for the lower number of available contracts for SDS, especially since poor autists can't afford that many contracts in the first place.

However, it was dropped due to unwanted side effects from its muscarnic agonist effects (parasympathetic things like vomiting, salivation, diarrhea etc.). But, drugs do exist that are antimuscarinic, but don't cross the blood brain barrier to cause CNS effects (like benadryl makes you drowsy).  You could theoretically combine them together to counteract the side effects. Trospium is one such drug; so, Karuna therapeutics was formed in 2009 to combine xanomeline and trospium as KarXT, and study it in schizophrenia/alzheimer's.

Phase 2 topline results were released in November 2019 and were extremely positive, hitting its primary endpoint. It showed PANSS score at five weeks of treatment was 11.6 point reduction compared to placebo. PANSS is a well validated scoring system to measure reduction of symptoms of psychosis. To compare how effective this is to the best selling atypical antipsychotic that already exists, see the drug Abilify ([https://www.aristadahcp.com/efficacy-pivotal-trial](https://www.aristadahcp.com/efficacy-pivotal-trial)). That drug achieved PANSS reduction of 14.7. So why would psychiatrists potentially pick KarXT over Abilify and similar existing antipsychotics? Because antipsychotics, as dopamine antagonists, have horrible side effects. They can cause disturbing extrapyramidal effects like tardive dyskinesia ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUr8ltXh1Pc&t=32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUr8ltXh1Pc&t=32s)). They can also make you fat, raise your cholesterol. Muscarinic agents like KarXT do not cause any of this and the phase 2 trial further demonstrates:  No evidence of somnolence, extrapyramidal side effects or weight gain compared to placebo.

And finally, of course; the Phase 2 results showed KarXT was very well tolerated as opposed to the Phase 2 Eli Lilly studies back in 1990s. There were similar discontinuation rates between KarXT (20%) and placebo (21%).

Reward:

Best case scenario, is compare this to the drug Abilify (aripiprazole) by BMY. They hit 7.4 billion in peak sales in 2011. As the best selling atypical antipsychotic used to treat the same things KarXT is targeting but with far worse side effects, if KarXT becomes a similar blockbuster and becomes favored by clinicians for its better adverse effect profile, then if this shit hits global peak sales of over 7 billion in the future, we can apply a conservative biotech industry average of 3x multiple to sales to generate a market cap of 21 billion. That would take years (like by 2030) but represent 1100% upside to the current price. More realistically, I would expect the company gets bought out well before then.

Also more realistcally, other actual analysts such as from Citi project peak unadjusted sales estimate in schizophrenia to $4.7B.  But, that is for schizophrenia alone. However, if KarXT eventually also proves to be effective in ameliorating psychosis with Alzheimer's, expect the peak sales estimate to climb towards that 7 billion.

Risks:

Your investment goes to zero because biotech.

Financials:

very solid. After phase 2 topline results, a public offering of 2.6 million shares priced at $96 a share should have added roughly 250 million in cash. Their 3rd quarter 2019 financial update showed cash balance of 161 million and they projected that amount ALONE was enough to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of 2021. This includes multiple clinical and development milestones INCLUDING a Phase 3 clinical trial of KarXT in psychosis related to schizophrenia. So, at a cash pile of 411 million to start in 2020, we should expect a low probabilty of further offerings or dilution to the stock in the near future.

Tldr:

&#x200B;

KRTX is severely underpriced relative to its significantly derisked pipeline drug KarXT. You can observe its stock price has climbed everyday of actual high volume with the big boys buying but has been dumped by MM/algo/panicked retail investors on low volume days. Its public offering price at NINETY SIX dollars a share in November 2019 after phase 2 results means that should be the price FLOOR for this stock at this stage. That is a 33.6% upside to yesterday’s close.

This stock will take likely another year plus to realize the results of Phase 3 and then FDA submission after that.

I work in healthcare and there's a lot of money made using nitric oxide to treat pulmonary hypertension of the newborn in NICU's.  The problem is the hospital has to store the heavy tanks, replace the tanks, and if I remember correctly they have an expiration.  So if they're not used, they're out of luck.  Beyond Air has created a one-of-a-kind machine that creates nitric oxide from ambient air.  No tanks.  They're sitting at a market cap of 75M right now and FDA approval for their machine is supposed to happen this quarter.  Will it get approved? There has been ZERO SAEs during trials.  There is no reason the FDA doesn't approve this. Institutional holdings have increased as have insider buying in the last 3-6 months. 

They're also trying to market toward disease processes that aren't normally treated with NO.  That could be huge for them.  Their trial out of Israel showed a decreased length of stay for patients with bronchiolitis.

The downside, if they do get approved sales are only likely to be around 300M.  They come with a proprietary filter that has to be replaced, so there's additional revenue but still your probably only looking at a 2-3 bagger max in the next year or two.  No option chain either.

P.S. - As Uber cuts down its incentive spend (through reduced competition and increased focus on profitability across competitors) and R&D, they'll move towards profitability. 

On top of that - just a quick note, 
Uber's acquisition of Careem officially closing, Uber's global portfolio includes a stake in the leader in every region where they don't operate themselves.

• 15% of Didi (China) 
• 23% of Grab (SEA)
• 38% of Yandex (Russia)
• 100% of Careem (Middle East)

The approximate value of Uber's stake in each at current values:

• Didi: ~$9B
• Grab: ~$3B
• Yandex Taxi: $1.5B
• Careem: ~$3B

Subtract out the above $16.5B of value and the $7B of cash net of long term debt they have and the core business is being valued at ~$30B today. ~2x Lyft & valued at 2x sales.

Seems low.

The current price of the $95C for 2/21 are all 0.90-0.95, speculating an upside of just 5% from it's current levels. I added to my position today with 20 calls for the above option.

Current state of affairs:

Starbucks has been going through management changes over the last year to ensure that both the staff and management teams are properly trained after the racist blunder that occurred last year. Since then, Starbucks has gained a strong reputation for their service.

On the financial side of things, Starbucks has had a 10% year-over-year growth since 2016. This year, they are set to report -4% revenue compared to last year as a result of the China expansion and headwinds from the geopolitical shit storm between the US/China. Nonetheless, analyst believe that Starbucks will continue to grow as it has owns a large proportion of marketshare in this space with only few serious competitors like LK. Cashflow as of now is in the ballpark of $5B, with about 3B leveraged at the moment. As per the marketcap, they are at \~107B, with revenues sitting in the 26B range. They are only trading 4 times their revenue which makes this stock relatively affordable for a food/drinks related industry.

I presume that in this coming year, when the second phase of the trade talks are signed (Jan 15), the market will readjust and Starbucks will be aligned for meeting it's high (which currently is about 9% shy of the top). ER should be a beat and guidance should be raised with the addition of 2,000 stores world wide, and an average ROI of 70% in the 2018 fiscal year for the Chinese franchises and 50% ROI for domestic locations. 

On the options side of things, there is a lot of interest in the $90-100 Call range between 1/17-2/21 expiration. As of today, the short interest volume sits at 635k vs. total volume of 7.3 million (relatively low, but not a cause for concern).

There is plenty of room to run boys. Let's get out there with some fire plays, buy some of that Starbucks Coffee, and make those fire posts mid January.

Here's a legitimate reason to become a bear cuck that you can still mask as autistic, because it sure as hell sounds it - but it's actually supported by *real* data believe it or not. I have linked the academic study below if you want to read (you don't) but here's the short-ish version: 

The lunar cycle is the 1 month rotation of the moon around the earth and the different stages are marked by how the moon appears in the night sky. Every 2 weeks there is a full moon (full circle visible), and then two weeks later there is a new moon (no visible moon), and in the middle there is all sorts of half moons and crescent moons. The cycle repeats on and on and on every month. 

Just as the gravitational forces move the water on earth and cause the ocean tides, these particular alignments of the sun, moon and earth also cause chemical reactions in our brain (not sure what kind, but just go with it). On the dates of full and new moons there are higher suicide rates, higher aggression in schizophrenics, more hospital admissions, greater crime rates, all sorts of shit ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_effect) ). In short, the lunar cycle affects human psychology - a huge factor that affects the stock market, wouldn't you agree?  

Well it just so happens that stock markets exhibit unusual returns surrounding specific points in the lunar cycle. Stock returns are found to be lower on the days around a full moon than on the days around a new moon. This leads to an out performance of 3% to 5% per year if you consider the lunar cycle in your portfolio. i.e sell around a full moon, and buy around a new moon. 3-5% is pussy shit to be left for r/investing and tbh they are way too rational to base their portfolio on the moon. However, someone here ought to buy this moon theory, and by using options instead of a plain stock portfolio maybe that 3-5% could become 3-5,000%, no? 

At first I thought this sounded crazy, but you can look at a chart and see the effects for yourself. Below is the S&P500 with an overlay of the full and new moons. You can clearly see the market turning from bull to bear and vice versa at a new/full moon - particularly when emotions are ruling the market e.g. Q4 2018 - look at that bottom.

Anyway, today (10th Jan 2020) was a full moon - when market returns are usually depressed. Not only that, it was a special kind of full moon known as a 'Wolf Moon', because it was the first full moon of the year - and wouldn't you know markets were negative.. coincidence? I think not. (BBC wolf moon report:  [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51066892](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51066892) ) 

The market has been overbought for the past 3 months now and IMO this is the final signal we needed for the bears to take over. Today was negative and I'm calling the top. Monday the 13th of Jan, soon to be known as Black Monday, will be devastating - down >10% at the open at least. I hope you can buy some OTM puts in time or already have some. 

**Enjoy your tendies.**  

TL;DR - it was a full moon today so buy OTM $SPY puts or short SPY

People will get hyped about the free 40% without understanding whats going on.

Let me break it down for you.

Buy Nlok now 26.45 cents

Own Nlok from January 23rd till Feb 3rd (you have to own past Jan 31st to get dividend you won't be able to sell till Feb. 3rd cause weekend).

You will receive 12 dollars per share congrats.

So what's the catch?

The stock is now worth 14.45, you were JUST given your money back not a magical 40% gain. Put's and calls will be adjusted accordingly it's a 0 sum game.

So how do you make money? Well I'm not smart enough to tell you that, but its probably going to get a lot of headlines and alot of people buying running the price up because they don't understand. There will also probably be a sell off after the dividend.

I'd say the best time to get into this stock is after the selloff for the long term hold potential of the company.

**What the fuck is CRC?**

California Resources Corporation is the largest oil/gas producer in California. This bitch was spun off from OXY in 2014, and boy was it bad. They stripped them of their accounts receivables but left them with their accounts payables -> debt basically fucked them for years and still does. As a result it's one of the highest beta stocks on the market (I believe **the**highest in the E&P sector). Peak post spin debt of about $7bn and currently just under $5bn of debt with about $1.2-1.4bn of EBITDAX projected for this year. CRC is a traditional steamflood producer \*\*(emphasis, CRC does not utilize fracking),\*\*which in turns makes it's wells low declining (7-10% a year declines vs some of the 40%+ first year declines we see in shale plays).

**What's the deal with it now?**

Yeah, looks bad. From a post spin peak of about $90 when oil was ripping back them to a low of nearly $3 a few months ago right before Q3 earnings. This is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, with a short interest of \~40% currently. The stock made a run up in 2018 all the way up to $50 to get shit on for all of 2019 down to where it is now. I've been long on the equity since $7 in 2017, and have been trading options in and out of it for the last year. Lot of fear mongering in the company and it's ability to repay debt, along with CA being batshit crazy legislative wise over oil.

**The company itself and pros/cons**

I saw this thing run up from $7 to $50, and I think it can do it again; and profiting on the volatility on the way isn't bad. This management team is stellar, Todd Stevens has one massive dick and has stated he's not afraid to play chicken with the shorts. They've been pretty much cash flow positive through this entire low cycle of oil (Sub $70 Brent, sub $65 for pretty much the whole part) and have worked towards paying back debt while similar shale companies are on the verge of blowing up since their well declines have been drastically understated and no one wants to lend to these mfs anymore.

WSJ article on issues with Shale here:

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-shale-wells-age-gap-between-forecasts-and-performance-grows-11577631601](https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-shale-wells-age-gap-between-forecasts-and-performance-grows-11577631601)

two big cons of CRC:

* Massive Debt, main reasoning for the price decline  

   * Huge debt wall in 2021/2022, which if you don't come up with a large source of cash or pay off enough to refi it's going to bury you.
   * They've made strides to buying back their debt on the open market; I believe since the start of this year they've bought back about $250MM or so of their 2nd Liens at a 30% discount or something like that (feel free to correct me on their IR page), but it's not significant enough with how big the mountain is with small repurchases
* Oil Pricing  

   * It seems like most people in the space are chanting lower for longer. If Brent plummets under $60, we're gonna have a hard time paying back debt. At $60, it's not CHP11, but it's not great either. Long story short Brent staying around or even over $70 for the next year or two is going to help a lot with the debt reduction process. Note that CRC receives Buena Vista pricing, which trades currently at a \~$3 premium to Brent.
* CA Legislation  

   * Yeah we're fuckin democrats and they hate oil and big money shit yada yada. Bills get proposed all the time, and they tank the stock. They never pass. AB345? and the recent fracking one are great examples. Shit tanked 30%+ just to recover the next day when that shit dies. CA is a **DRIVING STATE** and that won't change, not everyone is buying a TSLA just get (I know praise our god Elon). And it's oil dependent. No piplines. 70%+ of it's crude is imported. From where you ask? Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, etc. Oh do I need to mention those places are kinda in a sticky spot right now?
* There's a lot of hit pieces on CRC you can find on SeekingAlpha; most of them will pretty much reiterate the same two points. Lots of debt, low oil prices, company is fucked.

**Why I think it's a winner**

Alright I'm getting kind of lazy, so I'm linking Seth Lowry, CFA's comments from SA here, I know it's on a fucking forum but this is probably the most insightful comment into CRC I've ever seen. Scroll down near the bottom of the comments, it's **really** long so you can't miss it:

Edit: Can't post direct SA link so here's an imgur gallery of his comment. If you want to get the link to just read the discussion I'm happy to PM.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/8MYsjUt](https://imgur.com/gallery/8MYsjUt)

For you fucks that are too lazy to read it, long story short:

The debt wall is definitely there, but it's still \~2 years out. Management has time. And management has been calculated. Listen to any of their conference calls (if you're not fuckin lazy) and they have been reiterating the same message for the last 2 years, and been consistent on it. Instead of a silver bullet, a multi-pronged approach to delevering gives them the best shot:

* ORRI - basically a royalty sale. CRC owns Elk Hills, which is a massive fucking field in Cali. If they sell $50MM a year of production, at a 16-20x multiple, that could be up to $1bn to use towards debt repayment. $RRC recently did a few ORRIs at 12-14x multiples, and those were gas, high (20%+) declines. We're talking oil, low, 7-10% declines.
* Midstream Assets - CRC has $1bn+ worth of midstream assets they can still monetize, examples have already been done before ie with Ares, still viable.
* Huntington Real Estate Sale - CRC owns \~90ish acres of prime beach real estate in Cali. Why? I forget and I don't fucking care. Just know that there was a bid on it back in 2010 for $300mm. I work in REPE, and that shit is definitely worth a lot more now. Sam Zell just did a JV with CRC. **Yeah, the billionaire, real estate Sam Zell**. Wonder if need be he would have any interest in taking some of that?
* Debt Repurchasing - Hell yeah these bonds trade at a fucking discount, and management knows it. They stated on the last call, why even bother chucking all our FCF at exploration right now? Our second liens trade at literal 75% discount, we have \~$1bn of JV capital in hand to drill with, and buying our bonds gives us a straight 200%+ IRR right off the bat.  

   * *Sidenote, the JVs are mostly done with clauses that allow the interests to revert back to CRC once a certain hurdle has been hit, 2 which were done with BSP partners and Macquarie are due to revert any day now, where CRC's interest in the cash flow reverts from \~10-15% to the majority \~80%. This should add $100MM+ to the topline when they do.*
* The Macro Picture - Tension in the middle east, Iran today, dur. Mohamed Bone Saw briefly got his $2tn, but that doesn't mean jack shit unless he can IPO the rest internationally and secure his tendies. He's an autist just like us and is long hella OTM in $OIL. So bet your ass he's going to do anything and push any narrative he can to get Oil up.  

   * U.S. shale production, which has been the biggest driver in oil supply in so many years looks like it's finally tapering off. These fucks can barely keep up at $65 brent, look at the frac spreads and how badly the rig count has dropped. And to anyone who says they can just ramp up production when they want if oil rips up, the fuck? You seen how much debt these guys owe? Makes CRC look like peanuts. I think it's $100BN+ over the next 5 years? With Tier 1 acreage running out? And totally restricted lending? If anything, the downfall of some of these other players will be a godsend to CRC. Investors (already have) will pull out shale, leaving only the big boys and will seek other, actual value investments. Look no further than $HAL and $SLB both taking $10BN+ impairments the last quarter in the NA divisions.

Some people point out that the company could have issued new equity last year when the stock was near $50, that would have brought in some cash that could have been used to pay down debt; in hindsight they might point out it was stupid not to, but management has made it a point that they haven't had to issue much equity since the spin period. I think it's a testament to their situation. They're not as desperate as they seem and have a few options to pull from. Listen to the BAML transcript if you can from \~2 months back. Todd mentioned a JV upcoming soon, potential real estate monetization ""within a few months"", and confirmed there has been a party they are in talks with about the ORRI. I will say the firms PR is pretty trash at keeping investors up to date with all that's going on, which is why there's still a heavy downward pressure on the stock. It's a ""show me"" type of company. But we broke $10 today, and most of the shorts really came in at the teens. A bit higher and we could see a short squeeze of legendary proportions.

TL,DR: $CRC calls, or put credit spreads. I'd say May 2020 if you're ballsy, 2021-2022 leaps are good play. I'm currently doing both - naked calls for May 2020 at $10 strike, then 3 option bull strats for 2021-2022, a put credit spread and then a call on both. As well as the equity in my IRA and accounts with my financial advisor because I am a sick fuck. Feel free to inverse me and post positions.

edit: RH positions so u mfs don't ban me, rest is just equity in my TDA and IRA but you tards wouldn't understand the graphics anyways. Depending on how the picture looks after Q4 earnings I plan on throwing a few thousand more in calls if it's good. Look for mgmt to make good progress on the 2L and give a meaningful update on JV/ORRI so we can hit that \~$3bn overall debt mark. I think if that can happen no reason why over the next year or two this can't have another crazy run up. Their PV-10 reserves at $65 brent alone are worth \~$5bn+, chuck in another $2bn of infrastructure assets and land holdings, if you run the numbers fair share price should be really in the $20s right now, which is where it was when brent was trading in this range back in May. Just lots of short pressure keeping it down.

**EDIT 2: Thank you** [**u/Dmillehe**](https://www.reddit.com/u/Dmillehe) **spending his money on Platinum instead of AMZN stock. You're the real autist.**

Amazon is going to dominate the next decade. It's a wonderful business trading at a discount to it's true ability to create cash earnings. My thesis is that traditional methods of valuation that work for most companies don't work for Amazon. This misunderstanding between market 'conservatives' or 'traditionalists' .. so called value oriented investors (of which I consider myself a part) is currently reflected in the share price today, and it's a mistake. Second, the firm has reached a point of inflection, where scale will now provide growth of earnings far in excess of growth in sales. This multiyear catalyst provides a fundamental basis for significant share price appreciation.

To understand why Amazon presents such a compelling investment opportunity, one must understand what is currently transpiring in two specific and unique business segments. E-commerce and Cloud Computing. Many of you are probably familiar with at least the former. The latter is foreign territory to most.

**E-Commerce: Why Amazon is prepared to conquer the next decade in retail.**

Traditional retail or brick and mortar (B&M from here on out) is still the dominant form of consumer spending in the U.S. and will be for some time. [As of Q3 2019, total retail spend amounts to $5.4 Trillion dollar for the prior 12 months.](https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf) E-commerce amounts to merely 11.2% of this amount (on a run rate basis.) While the size remains relatively small, e-commerce is growing in the mid-teens year over year, or now 5% quarter to quarter and the rate of growth is accelerating. The rate of E-commerce growth has doubled in 12 months.

To understand why this is the case, a qualitative evaluation of the differences between the two is critical. B&M requires physical space that is expensive to build and maintain. It requires uniformed, reliable, friendly and knowledgeable staff. It requires the deliberate presentation of inventory and restocking, amounting to a unique challenge to the retailer of determining layout of shelf space, product mix and promotion.

It's costly for the consumer too. They have to drive there, walk in, and find what they are looking for. This requires owning a car or putting up with public transportation. This can take a significant amount of time. There are some hidden costs too, without E-commerce, price discovery is a pain in the ass. Something retailers are keenly aware of. Here's something interesting about humans and economics. In economics, for a long time, we've modeled humans like they're these perfect rational beings. Ideally.. they'll drive down the road to a different store to get 3% off of whatever they're buying. Ideally. And you **will** do that for a car. But in reality, if it's 3% off a bag of chips, it's not worth the hassle. It's too expensive to go get $.14 of savings when you have to drive another 10 minutes to another grocery, walk in to figure it out if you're actually saving the most money.. consumers don't do that.

Consumers don't engage in price discovery on most of their small dollar purchases, they don't do that with traditional retail, because it's too costly in time and effort. There's too much friction in the trade-off.

The value proposition of E-commerce is that it saves consumers time and money. Getting in the car, loading the kids in the back, driving, parking, and then hunting for what you want, making sure you are getting a fair price, E-commerce throws all of that out the window. The value proposition for retailers too, is that it saves them time and money. There are plenty of retailers currently taking an omni-channel approach to retail, those who want to shop in person get to, those who shop online can do that too.. everybody wins. E-commerce takes the friction out of price discovery on small dollar purchases.

Given the advent of mobile computing more than a decade ago, many big box retailers also adopted a price match strategy, if you can find it online for the same price? Best Buy, Micro Center etc. they'll match it to keep you as a customer. But that's the extent of it, try going to Kroger and arguing with the cashier about Albersons having a 3/$5 deal on Frito Lay Potato Chips.. that ain't happening.

Amazon isn't Ecommerce, they are a part of it. Their strategy is different than the whole. They are technically omni-channel. However the little B&M they've done mostly as R&D experiment, more on Whole Foods in a minute. The Amazon E-Commerce thesis is this: **At the end of the day, most consumer purchases are commodity purchases.** They are small dollar items that are easily replicated. This segment of retail has yet to be disrupted by E-Commerce until now. It overlaps with specialty retail and big box items almost seamlessly from a logistical standpoint. The revenue streams are more stable than specialty retail, and it presents a massive opportunity in the long run.

I had the chance to speak with a finance manager at Frito-Lay (subsidiary of PepsiCo) years back after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Amazon had been attempting for years to get the same products you see in any Kroger or Albertsons onto their platform. For a variety of reasons, PepsiCo would not play ball with Amazon. It amounted to channel conflicts between the big established players vs. the disruptive incumbent. What Pepsico had done to Amazon, had been done by Proctor and Gamble, Nestle, Kellogg, and many more.

The purchase of Whole Foods was a big F U, a ""we'll do it live"" moment.. a Leeroy Jenkins. So you won't let us into your club? Fine, we'll do it ourselves. [Grocer's panicked and for good reason](https://qz.com/1211449/amazon-is-wreaking-havoc-on-grocers-like-albertsons/). They were the reason Amazon had been held at bay for so long. They'd used their absolute size for many years to prevent E-commerce retailers from getting the same product mix at the same price online. Amazon responded by entering their territory, in buying a physical grocery chain. Grocer's fear was real and warranted, however the truly brilliant component of this purchase was that Amazon purchased for themselves a supply chain for grocery and private label products (365 brand.) Fast forward a couple years and Amazon now has over [four hundred private label brands, more than twenty three thousand individual SKUs and 1.4 Million reviews of these products/brands.](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/amazon-private-label-brands) That entire article is worth a thorough read. Each product line represents a moonshot where amazon can collect both sides of margin on a private label product that disrupts traditional brands. Often it goes well, sometimes it does not, but the platform allows them to poke holes in each product category, and cannibalize the producer surplus of other more expensive branded product in the process. They don't have to advertise, market or promote any of this either.. yet [it's already getting plenty of attention](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1120847137149833217?lang=en). 

[Here is a compelling example of how Amazon can undercut a premium brand with it's store brand knock off.](https://medium.com/@joeyzwillinger/dear-mr-bezos-e691f6d6d705) And there's nothing Allbirds can do about it.

Amazon has built out an infrastructure of warehouses (which are relatively cheaper to maintain on a $/sf basis than traditional B&M retail space) and delivery drivers to meet the daily needs of consumers accustomed to B&M retail. They've disinter-mediated the entire process. You do not need a car, you don't have to be nice to the person behind the counter, or go hunting for that specific product you need on aisle 9, or check to see if the price is competitive or on deal. You can just type it in to your phone in 5 seconds, and see quickly who has the best deal. Turns out (and this is from experience) 9/10 times Amazon has the best deal and they'll ship it that day or the next.

For the consumer, it amounts to savings in both time and money. What the data shows is that we are experiencing rapid change in slow motion. E-commerce is growing explosively here in the U.S. however it's still of relatively small scale, that it will take some time before eclipsing B&M retail. Second, the data shows this rate of growth is accelerating, and has **doubled in the last year or so**. Traditional retail is not going to disappear entirely either. There are plenty of Amazon proof businesses for now. Hair salons, vets, dentists, nail salons, along with restaurants and apparel to a certain extent.

This online E-commerce platform has allowed Amazon to build out a peripheral advertising business in search. The search component allows Amazon to promote it's own store brand product alongside the branded counterparts. Second, it's able to sell web page space to branded products. [Google currently dominates the search game, but Amazon is in 2nd place and stealing market share.](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-gaining-google-search-advertising-market-share/)

Finally, Amazon has rolled out a wonderful product called [Subscribe and Save](https://www.amazon.com/Subscribe-Save/b?ie=UTF8&node=5856181011). Within this platform, Amazon is able to offer 15%-20% savings on everyday commodity items in exchange for a commitment to purchase at a monthly frequency (and it can be cancelled at any time.) What Amazon has discovered is that subscription purchases are relatively sticky. In exchange for a soft commitment from consumers that is relatively stable and predictable, Amazon can actually lower the cost of goods to the consumer. In turn, they are also able to optimize logistically for these sales as they can plan far in advance for them. Second, this allows them to relay demand information to other merchants as well. Example: Amazon can remit data to Tide, and let them know how many pods they expect to need in the coming months based on subscription commitments. Both Tide and Amazon are able to lower CoGS because they have more time to plan for those costs.

Furthermore, if you have an Amazon Credit Card through Chase bank, [you get an additional 3%-5% all purchase at Amazon & Whole Foods.](https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/amazon/earn-rewards)

The combination of all of these benefits as a platform amounts is an incredibly compelling value proposition to consumers. As of June this year Amazon has accumulated [105 Million Prime Memberships in the United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/546894/number-of-amazon-prime-paying-members/), and it is the largest paid subscriber base of any company in the United States period.

One of the luxuries I enjoy in my occupation is that my employer has a very long investment time horizon & high risk tolerance. What this allows is for us to kick back, put our feet on the table and think about what the world will look like in 10 years and how we'd consider being a part of it.

So here's a thought experiment, what do you think the retail experience for consumers looks like in a decade? Here's my prediction. Consumer's buy the vast majority of the things they need online, and they receive it within a few hours to a day, and they're spending less than ever before on what they need. [This is already happening](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-effect-inflation-deflation-2017-10), and [It's grabbed the attention of people like Jim Cramer](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/03/cramer-remix-amazon-still-one-of-most-powerful-deflationary-forces.html), as well as [Fed Chairman Jerome Powell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/modeledbehavior/2018/04/07/is-amazon-holding-back-inflation/#7c8985593c02). Albeit, E-Commerce is relatively small for now, but the rapid transformation is already causing ripple effects across retail. In 10 years, my thesis is that E-commerce becomes the largest component of total retail sales and Amazon remains the largest component of that segment, as it is today. Additionally, they probably steal share and grow at a faster pace than E-commerce as a whole, as they have done over the last several years.

**Personal anecdote:**

I'm sitting here in my home office wearing [Amazon branded Jeans](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Mens-Slim-Fit-Stretch/dp/B07BJL18M5/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=amazon+jeans&qid=1578627734&s=apparel&sr=1-1). I've got 10+ Amazon branded undershirts upstairs, along with 5+ pairs of Amazon Synthetic Golf Shorts. In my house, we've got Amazon branded batteries, note cards & printer paper, detergent pods, echo devices, cameras and more all over the place. There's more too, but I'm not going to list it all. In my experience, what they make is just as good if not better than the branded counterpart, and they do it for less, often a lot less. And I got tired of hyperlinking, so if you're curious, go to [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) and start looking around for these products.

Even more, as of now my wife and I spend +$250/mo on subscribe and save items we need for our household, this includes baby formula, diapers and wipes, detergent, shampoo and soap, trash bags, dog food, paper towels and more. We use the 5% back credit card and blended save close to 20% on these daily items we need.

**In conclusion, on E-Commerce, I expect Amazon to dominate the next decade in retail. They have a massive competitive advantage over other retailers engaged in an omni-channel strategy, therefore it's their game to lose. Furthermore, their competitive edge today will compound into the future and amount to further share gains and a wider moat in years to come.**

**Cloud Computing: What is this industry, how does Amazon fit in the picture, and why is it such a big deal?**

Again, to understand Amazon you'll have to understand what Cloud Computing is. This is not an everyday consumer product/service, therefore it's foreign to most individuals. Second, because the transactions and services are business to business (B2B) it's relatively difficult to determine detailed industry characteristics. What may come as a surprise to you, is it's the most profitable business segment (on a NOPAT basis) and it's also their fastest growing segment.

Cloud computing is the service of providing storage, services, databases, software, security, analytics, artificial intelligence and infrastructure through the internet. There was a time when most businesses built their own server racks, and maintained their own infrastructure. Amazon too did this for themselves in building out their own infrastructure to maintain their E-Commerce platform. In time, they naturally sold this service to other firms.

So where does Amazon fit in now? From all indications cloud computing appears to be an arms race. The most recent estimates for market share vary depending on the research provider. The differences lie in what is being measured. There are multiple components of Cloud: PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS. By all accounts, Amazon Web Services is the clear market leader, but they aren't growing as fast as some of their well funded peers like Microsoft and Google.

The available literature on Cloud Computing as a whole is vague. There are important questions to answer regarding structural advantage or lack thereof, who has the competitive edge, or what kind of moats have been built. Amazon's slowing growth rate in Cloud is concerning. Ramped spend in R&D + SG&A during the 2019 fiscal year is encouraging, and these investments will reduce erosion of market share.

While Cloud remains Amazon's most profitable business segment for now, by revenue it's just \~12.5% of sales. Admittedly I am troubled by the amount of information I cannot obtain without significantly paying out of pocket. Nevertheless, given the relative size of this business, I'm comfortable putting the pencil down on AWS for now, and watching the industry closely going forward.

**Other Business Segments:**

Amazon has other business segments like their own B&M retail stores including Whole Foods, it's [4 star retail chain](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=20017628011&ref=AMZ4STR_GoogleListing_JDA1) as well as it's cashierless Amazon Go stores. All of these combined are worth little compared to the market cap, while interesting.. they are insignificant in determining Amazon's value as a business.

**What is Amazon worth today?**

Herein lies the problem for analysts when the look at Amazon. The most commonly used methods for determining value are off the charts, for the most part Amazon looks like lighting money on fire.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7iq4kk8hesa41.png?width=1703&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7b8a9fb6090406db8e0ddd51e9e776062b646cd

A simple value oriented investor looks at a trailing P/E of 84.19 and thinks **why would I wait 84 years to get paid back?**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d76fratiesa41.png?width=1689&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cc4e3e57054f658a33a7173084e1a5338da1997

Of course, that's too myopic, and value oriented investors who take that approach, quickly learn trailing P/E is the key to building a portfolio of value traps. More sophisticated investors like [Joel Greenblatt](http://www.poslovni.hr/media/PostAttachments/1203672/Joel%20Greenblatt%20-%20The%20Little%20Book%20That%20Beats%20the%20Market.pdf) might recommend using something like ROIC to gauge how much Amazon benefits from reinvesting and building out it's own business.

The problem with that approach is that ROC, ROCE, and ROIC all use some form of GAAP earnings (either NOPAT or EBIT) to backsolve for this return number. If you look at Amazon's Income Statement, and dissect why net income is what it is there's a good reason why most value metrics/ratios don't work for Amazon. They are investing \~3x NOPAT and 60% of Gross profit into R&D. SG&A tells a similar story. What is R&D anyways? One time costs to develop and build out a business. What is SG&A, variable manpower with a significantly lagged ROI when ramped more than 20% YoY.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/15v33d1lesa41.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4562988962ffc48d858a24b2a190b4db65f4c3d

What dawned on me months ago is this.. what if Amazon cut it's R&D to 0, and didn't touch SG&A? P/E TTM drops to \~20x. What happens to sales growth then? It slows.. and eventually converges with GDP, and then falls beyond that. The story of what Amazon's business is, especially E-Commerce, helps shed light on how long it'd take for Amazon's growth to converge with GDP, when they're on the cutting edge of the knife, and most other competitors remain far behind.

What do other institutions believe Amazon is worth?

https://preview.redd.it/wuzx3n6nesa41.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=959d83285bb9f67715415a9011802e6039d72d2d

There are 45 Wallstreet Analysts covering the stock. On average, their price target is 2170. Based on the share price today, if they're right, you can expect a 15% return. What if the bears are right? You'll lose \~2% rounding down. And the bulls? the highest estimate is 2550, and represents a 35% premium on the stock.

Here's what Morningstar thinks:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/capam6koesa41.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2ae1e2e6b91882f60c01dec9cb983c8439ccfa8

Keep in mind, the last price is a bit dated. Let's pretend Morningstar is right, I like them more than most analysts. You can expect a 22% return.

I don't like wall street analysts, if I did, I wouldn't do this, and I'd just follow their guidance. They are often right, but can be very wrong at times. The problem with wall street analysts is that they are subject to herding, as well as many other behavioral biases and sometimes conflicts of interest.

But assuming they're right, this is an asymmetric long to take, with significant upside today.

I have an estimate for fair value as well. This involves taking the current growth rate for amazon as well as the mean estimate of earnings two years out. However, instead of earnings, I like mean cash flow per share, because it remains undistorted by GAAP adjustments.

Here are the current cash flow per share estimates:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9e4sgdmqesa41.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=d878cacc7620af283233c63ab493c6500b55ba0c

Here is my valuation model:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3pqriw0sesa41.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=16810d9c5ad87ca7b10b01ae3cb590e774f28340

Bottom left in yellow: that is the implied value of AMZN shares today, based on the discounted free cash flows.

Bottom middle with a red circle around it, those are my assumptions for long term growth rate and EPS 2 years out.. so TTM 2021 cash flows.

This would imply a 63% upside on the share price today.

Now, I don't think anyone is getting 63% today, for AMZN shares. Admittedly I'd be surprised if you got \~$3100 for AMZN shares in a year. Unfortunately.. this business will probably continue to be misunderstood like it has been for many years until they're done reinvesting a significant portion of their gross profit into building the infrastructure that expands their business. However, that cash flow number will become remarkably close to EPS with R&D turned off. When it does, share price will rocket. Instead of this becoming a one time event, I expect convergence will be gradual over time, which makes it a long term hold.

**More on valuation:**

I was disappointed but not surprised to find [I'm not the only one thinking about valuation in this way](https://valueinvestorsclub.com/idea/AMAZON.COM_INC/0950248237#description). The authors take is similar to mine, and he comes to a similar conclusion as well: \~20x P/E TTM. I've gone through everything the VIC has to say about AMZN and most everything should be available to you as non-members as it is dated. I found message 109 especially compelling:

**In Conclusion:** I recommend Amazon stock as a long term investment. I believe this is one of the best value propositions available in this market. Regardless of the broader stock market, the secular trends within retail are significant tailwinds to Amazons largest business segment.

**Disclaimer:** This document is entirely my own work, outside of linked/pictured information above which has been cited. I own a significant amount of AMZN stock personally. I am not responsible for your gains or losses. I may add more information to this document in the future.

**Addendum (1/14/20):** The most significant risk to this business is political. The election of either Warren or Sanders in November of this year would most certainly affect valuation for this business in the near term. Whether Amazon is actually harmed by political interference is another story. For now, it appears the odds that either of these candidates receives the nomination is significantly below 50%, furthermore, as of now it appears they would be significantly disadvantaged against the orange man.

From 2000-2013, OKcupid, Match, Eharmony and Plenty of Fish (POF) ruled the dating world. ¾ are now owned by $MTCH. Currently, Tinder rules the scene. It’s easy to see why online dating has been successful, but what makes these sites profitable and why the fuck would you want to invest?  

$MTCH’s has seen [steady growth](https://www.statista.com/statistics/449390/quarterly-revenue-match-group/) each quarter since they’ve hit the market, and even with the IAC split, they've still been going strong 

And while $MTCH owns quite a few dating companies, the biggest money makers for them are Match.com, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and by far, Tinder.   
   
Match.com has always been free to look, but pay to play. Want to message that cute girl? Pay us $30 a month. Then there is the 3-month guarantee that you'll find the one, put another $90 behind that, sucka. It’s not nearly as prolific as it once was, but it’s still currently the home to some desperate ladies who think a paid site will weed out the thirsty dudes, and of course, the same average thirsty dudes.   
   
OKcupid is currently suffering a fate worse than death: A lack of identity. It was the most celebrated and lauded free dating website until about 2017, when it was eventually taken over by $MTCH. They took everything people loved about it and tossed it out the window. It now resembles a clunky Tinder wannabe with math and more bots than Wall-E. How do they make money? A-list, something that men can even gift to women they like, which those ladies in turn, can go find some other dude on the site to date. Touché, OkCupid. Unfortunately, the site is such a mess that it’ll be completely dead in a few years, if not, this year.   
   
Plenty of Fish…sigh. I’ll be honest; this is the Wal-Mart of online dating. I’ve only ever been on one date from the site years ago. She tricked me with her angles and I swore off the site, never to look back. Its user base hasn’t changed much over the years according to most, and houses some of the most bottom of the barrel people to exist in the U.S. It also surprisingly-unsurprisingly still has the most activity of any online dating site or app. Boosted by its POF Premium package which apparently tricks people into thinking that it will help them get more matches, it’s been a good source of revenue for $MTCH since 2015.

Now to the moneymaker, Tinder, also owned by $MTCH. A few years ago, Tinder executed the ultimate drug dealer move; got people hooked for free then started charging people for it, and somehow maintained their user base.  They introduced Tinder+ ($20 a month) and Tinder Gold ($30 a month), along with super swipe, and boost, and most recently: Super Boost ($45-$100 depending on your area, for a ONE time use). You can go over to r/tinder to see what these paid tools have done to these horny guys. I myself haven’t had a date using Tinder since late 2018 and switched from it in early 2019, as I’m not a fan of paying to play. But the amount of free advertising it gets from movies, tv shows, podcast, comics, etc. is not something to take lightly. 

The one thing $MTCH won’t tell you about Tinder is their male to female ratio. The last time they did was in 2016, which even then was heavily skewed in favor of men. According to some recent studies, the male to female ratio is around 85% to 15%., but the popularity for the app has not decreased. One is to surmise that an increase in dudes is an increase in profits. 

Competition? Bumble is a good app that puts the “power” into women’s hands by having them make the first move, but as a recent hookup put it, “I got what men want, why would I need to waste effort by messaging first.” Where’d I meet this ""catch?” Hinge. Hinge, also owned $MTCH, has steadily become my go to in the last 2 years, as it has a nice interface, it’s easy to navigate and allows you to send a quick message along with your ‘like’ to get the lady’s attention. However, Bumble is increasing their users at a rapid rate and is only second to Tinder in regards to online dating apps, but it’s doubtful that they will ever pass Tinder.   
 

Facebook Dating is about 8 years too late. If POF is the Wal-Mart of dating, Facebook Dating is the Dollar Tree. Facebook is dominated by the 40+ crowd and won’t be relevant until they introduce Instagram dating, which would be an epic move on their part since it houses the majority of the people likely to use any of the aforementioned apps, sites previously mentioned.   
 

EHarmony?[😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/) [😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/) [😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)[😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)

To conclude in my experience, you can’t underestimate what $MTCH has. People are lazy and want to put as little effort into things as possible these days. Why talk to that hot girl sitting across from me in the coffee shop when I can I pull out an app and easily score a date with a 5/10. $MTCH has cornered the online dating marketing and as always, sex is in demand and like theta gang $MTCH sells both “calls” and puts” and people are buying both in bulk.

1.) We are at historically elevated valuations.   Somewhere between the Dotcom bubble and Black Tuesday in terms of PE.  Below is a chart of the current Schiller PE levels - this is a popular measure used by value investors such as Warren Buffet.    


Just so you know the historical average is somewhere in the 15 to 20 range. I would expect that to creep up due to low interest rates, but we're certainly well past 'safe' levels.

2.) Speaking of Pappa Buffet - he has been hoarding cash.  Berkshire Hathaway continues to grow its cash pile as there is 'nothing to buy' in this environment.  The chart is a bit old, but last I heard it was somewhere between 100 to 200 billion in cash sitting on the sidelines.  This is on a company with about a 500bil market cap. They would rather just sit on cash than risk getting caught with their pants down.

3.)  But... companies are crushing it and we live in the greatest economy the world has ever seen don't we???  Actually earnings have been pretty stagnant since 2015.  There are a few companies absolutely crushing it - namely big cap tech, but on average corporate earnings has been mediocre.    


P.S - This chart would look a hell of a lot worse if not for stock buybacks.

4.) Degenerate investment institutions are levered long and doing dangerous shit like shorting the VIX / running an excessive allocation of derivatives (Looking at you DB).  No one seems willing to admit that this is where the Repo Market money is going, and we can't really get a chart of that capital per-se, but we can find more generic information about margin levels.  


See some of those massive contractions in margin levels?  Generally speaking those aren't from deleveraging - when bubbles burst and portfolio values go down institutions and individuals begin facing margin calls... Forcing more selling, forcing more margin calls etc.  When the market is highly levered it creates a potential for alarmingly rapid draw-downs.

I won't even go into the details regarding how the global economy is also in shambles and fueled by debt too.  GDP numbers don't account for debt based growth and low interest rates everywhere has caused an explosion of cheap debt. This onion has far more layers than what's described here.

[Altaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaba) is the company left over when Yahoo! was bought out by Verizon. It was made up of various assets that in time we're sold off, with only 5 million shares of Alibaba stock left as the remaining part of its planned dissolution.

On Monday it [announced plans to liquidate 5 million shares](https://www.barrons.com/articles/altaba-begins-sale-of-remaining-alibaba-stake-51579020598) in the ""days to come"" with 1 million shares sold that day. Daily movement of BABA is ~13 million shares, having 5 million shares unloaded over the course of the week has certainly impacted the price. 

Currently [Altaba.com](https://www.altaba.com/) has an updated tally on shares sold, ~3.4million as of today. Assuming they sold 1 million shares the day of the announcement then they have averaged ~800 million shares a day every day after (but likely not as linear as that).  That leaves 1.6 million shares to be sold on Friday (and possibly bleeding into Monday based on this assumed average).

Due to the dual listing nature of Alibaba we will see continued drops in prices on the US side that will in turn negatively impact the HK listing. Just as increased buying on one side has seen the recent driving up in price this rush of selling will see a spiraling effect in the short term.

My belief is the pricing decline will continue to $215-$219 until Altaba announces completion of the indicated sale (again likely early next week) plus a short period for the information to be disseminated (my hope is the close of next week) before we a rise of price.

With all that said this is a **buying opportunity in Calls.** Looking to buy 1/31 strikes on the cheap in anticipation of a slow rise in price and huge increase in interest for the first earnings call (Jan 28) since the dual listing went live.

Also targeting June calls as that will have put the HK listing at over the 6 months mark, which while not rule, will likely make it eligible for the ""Shanghai Hong Kong stock connect"". This will make Alibaba eligible for investment by mainland Chinese investors (many mistakenly believe the HK listing did that) which may materially affect pricing.

Also TSLA will hit $420 again....",2020-01-17 06:52:25

Let me introduce those of lesser knowledge among you to the Basic Bitch Becky Basic Business Cycle (most of you autists are very familiar, so this will be a quick recap).

Growth => Debt => Growth => Overspending => Inflation => Fed Acts to create recession

Okay, now what's the second last part of that cycle? Inflation. Inflation always precedes a recession(After all, if there's no inflation, the fed can simply turn on the printing presses and create as much growth as it wants). In the postwar period, we can find just one example of a recession which starts with an inflation rate lower than the current one(2.30%). That was July 1953, the exact date of the end of the Korean war. The ending of wars always creates recessions as war spending dries up and soldiers have to find new jobs, but these are short-lived and lead ultimately to new bull markets and all time highs. So if Trump pulls all US troops back from abroad will we get a recession? Yes. Long story short: He won't. Chart for quick ANALysis(tho relatively easy to make on your own on FRED's autist playground website):

https://imgur.com/O5U1UkY

Okay, moving on. We have had no recessions at these levels of inflation, yet we live in a time of far more aggressive money printing retards than ever before. The fed will pump as much as they can into the system, as they are now doing, because it makes them look good and makes Ms. Jerome's famous blowjobs just that much better. They will justify it with all sorts of hocus-pocus logic. (""Because inflation was below our magic 2% number for so long, we must now put inflation ABOVE the 2% money number for equally long time to break even!"" is one such 80IQ PHD rationale) 

Okay, but now the more discerning among you are asking: can't inflation ramp up very quickly, leading the current rates of inflation to be largely noninformative of future trends? Yes. However I have heard from many smart people that this is unlikely given the current state of the macro, the micro, and so forth. I defer your excellent question to them, and blame them fully if they are wrong.

Right now in the Basic Bitch Becky Basic Business Cycle we are currently at growth, just beginning to step into overspending as falling ""true"" rates of growth must be supplemented by fed funny money so that Lord Trump can win in 2020, Mr. Jerome keeps his job and everybody looks like they know what the fuck they're doing. No recession 2020, no recession 2021.

I've since dug a little deeper into SBUX to get a better outlook of what we might expect to hear for ER and guidance. 

As of now, SBUX owns about 10% of the coffee market. The numbers are even more staggering at nearly 40% of the market in the U.S alone. In 2019, Starbucks made a huge expansion of 2000+ locations, situating this franchise in more than 33,000 locations across the globe. Recently, their former CEO also announced plans to expand 100 community Starbucks stores by 2025 in specific low-income communities and hire locally. That's going to be great PR.

As of late, we can also see that Starbucks is also rising steadily from sub 90 to currently 92+ some change.  Earnings will be coming up, and we would likely beat EPS estimates but not my large margins as the additional revenue from the added locations will not take full effect until 1-2 years after it's establishment. But that means guidance will look strong coming into the rest of 2020. 

Not to mention, coffee is a staple for most, and the market that SBUX is aiming towards is diverse. 

I'm looking to add a few more $90/92.50 for March 20 expiration. Will be looking forward to ER and hopefully an 8 point increase in the coming month to get us back at the 52 year high. Charts are also looking strong with huge support at $90 and a building green candle coming off of the $90.50 area. As Trump would say, ""things are looking great"". ""very nice"".

Macros are extremely bullish due to expectation that low interest rates are here to stay (before we expect interesting rate to go back up at some point, but now, there is no chance of that). Bubble will form. TSLA is the FOTM stock, it will pop tremendously on a good earnings report.
2. Delivery number are very good at 112k. Delivery exceeded maximum production capacity as production is only at 105k (also a record, production is improving but gradually), so much so that I expect that there is a backlog going into Q1. An obvious piece of evidence for this is that Tesla has not reduced prices even though it has raised prices by $500 on Q4 2019. Last year Tesla drop prices substantially immediately in the first week of January.
3. If point 2 is true, then Elon will probably revise his expectation for Q1/Q2 2020 to be fairly profitable. If this happens the shorts will be FUBAR as the short thesis will completely crumble as Q1/Q2 2020 unprofitability is critical to the short thesis.
4. If point 2 is true, S&P inclusion will happen shortly after Q1 2020. Adding fuel to the expectation of an epic rise.
5. Model Y is expected to be released soon (my expectation is that it will release early Q2 2020), I remember the run up prior to release of Model 3. Taken all this together, the next few months has the potential for an absolutely epic run for TSLA.

124,DD,An Investigation into Aurora’s (ACB) financials,0.9998,epkndq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/epkndq/an_investigation_into_auroras_acb_financials/,39,1579216606.0,"Hi everyone- I’m a college student looking to enter the cannabis research field. In my free time, I like to write about publicly traded companies. Aurora (ACB) has intrigued me for the last few weeks so I wrote up a report about the company's liquidity risk. From some reformulation of the financial statements I think the market consensus that the company won't be able to afford its debt is wrong. I currently don't have money in ACB but I'll buy some stock after the write down of its Goodwill built up from the MedReleaf acquisition, which I think wiIl happen next quarter (Early Feb - May 2020).

TLDR- ACB’s liquidity issues are overblown and management is already in the process of mitigating them. The company is primed to outperform after its write down of Goodwill; could be a buy after it's announced.

Investors are spooked by ACB’s deteriorating margins and the most recent quarter’s loss. Through an analysis of the Q1 2020 financial statements, I think it’s pretty clear that the company’s cash and cash-like position is still strong enough to defend against increasingly high interest payments.

[https://assets.ctfassets.net/rhxhcf3cql1g/7p3Er952vcGekZovryfU7y/6969db5521c23a7f172d96805e5876e5/FS\_2019.09.30\_11.14.2019.pdf](https://assets.ctfassets.net/rhxhcf3cql1g/7p3Er952vcGekZovryfU7y/6969db5521c23a7f172d96805e5876e5/FS_2019.09.30_11.14.2019.pdf)

ACB’s stock price is down more than 70% over the last twelve months. The bear case is primarily driven by the threat of a liquidity trap where the company doesn’t have enough cash on hand to pay for its debt.

Let’s start by looking at the current financial picture. It’s a little tricky to understand the true debt profile because ACB reports it with most of its other income in the income statement. Fortunately, Note 13 gives some information about all payments outstanding (including the current and long-term debt the company owes). By using the metrics in this note, I am taking an extraordinarily conservative view of debt because it assumes all money owed can be considered “debt”, instead of flowing into expense liabilities and the possibility of conversion to equity. As of September 2019, C$514,999 is current and C$1,422,042 is long-term. There is C$152,526 in cash on hand.

The market's concern is headlined by ACB’s negative interest coverage ratio and a quick ratio of 0.63 (acid test ratio). I agree that the company is not perfectly positioned to cover all of its current liabilities which does represent a huge risk. But the tangible assets on the company’s balance sheet are being undervalued as a way to protect against a liquidity threat.

I view ACB has more of an industrial, capital intensive business. For instance, the PPE account grew more than 27% since last quarter to C$972,788 and intangible assets, items like dispensary licenses, permitting, and IP, totaled more than C$682,694, compared to a sales total of C$281,097 in FY2019. I calculated the capital intensity of the company by estimating the amount of assets to produce a dollar of sales, or total assets divided by sales. Every publicly traded company classified in the marijuana cultivation and distribution industries came in above market averages for capital intensity. This makes it more appropriate to use the asset coverage ratio (tangible and liquid assets – short-term debt)/total debt) as a way to think about default risk because it factors in the high cost of fixed assets, like equipment and licenses, necessary to make money in the industry.

Continuing the trend of being conservative, I removed ACB’s overvalued Goodwill and all non-marketable intangibles from the asset calculations. I added back the valuable and relatively liquid licenses and permitting assets. Tangible assets of C$1,751,099, permits and licenses of C$206,886, current debt of C$514,999, and total debt of C$1,422,042 are used. ACB’s asset coverage ratio is 1.13. Not amazing, but it’s above the peer set mean and tells the story of a company with the ability to cover its debt appropriately or at least be in a position of strength when negotiating covenants. Additionally, the company can still draw from a C$360 million credit facility and has access to a $400 million at-the-market equity program. I don’t understand why analysts are crowning ACB as the next financial disaster in the sector when in reality it’s a company relatively ready to deal with its debt.

While this doesn’t necessarily prove the stock will go up, I think it shows that analyst views that the stock is “going to zero” are overblown and putting huge downward pressure on the price. It’s a self-fulfilling cycle that may be misguided.

The company has already proven it’s willing to sell underperforming assets to maintain a sufficient cash balance. On January 6th, Aurora listed a greenhouse for sale for $17 million, one it acquired as a primary location in its acquisition of MedReleaf Corp. in 2018.

[https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/aurora-cannabis-lists-greenhouse-for-sale-in-move-that-implies-massive-writedowns-analyst](https://business.financialpost.com/cannabis/cannabis-business/aurora-cannabis-lists-greenhouse-for-sale-in-move-that-implies-massive-writedowns-analyst)

The market views this as a fire sale and a signal of write downs. That’s true, ACB is probably going to write down its acquisition of MedReleaf, and consequently, its Goodwill. There is a view in the market that ACB’s acquisition of MedReleaf in 2018 for $3.2 billion was one of the most overvalued in the industry’s recent history. The stock will go down if/when the company makes the announcement, but it doesn’t change the fundamentals of the business.

The company’s products are viewed as best in class and will continue to have increasing demand. ACB now owns some of the top brands in the field and a vertically integrated supply chain. With the roll out of Cannabis 2.0, ACB is well positioned to be a market leader through its edibles product line.",2020-01-16 18:16:46

As shown at the below link, I have found a possible buy verdict on American Eagle Outfitters:

The only question I have is about the geometric means of the growth metrics for past performance. These are all great for the latest annual report. Over the past ten years, however, they're not.

I saw the same phenomenon for WW, the only other company over the past 10 months of analysis, since finishing the BUS123W course, which has come close to passing through the framework. The market loved WW regardless and it's gone up 150+% since hitting the cheap price calculated according to the course framework, $17.24. So this makes me wonder if the market will ignore the long term geometric means for the 4 /FDS growth metrics for American Eagle also, and bid it up because of its great ROCE and, for the past year at least, great growth?

To address the concerns: Apple going up 34% on the 3 month chart and 13% on the monthly is not a huge concern for me mainly because of these gains are supported by the integration and expansion of  Apple's service revenue and wearables (airpods/watches) revenue as part of it's core investment strategy. I think it's a healthy move to diversify and branch out from the flagship iPhone revenue which generates some 60% of it's revenue. Apple looks to be staging a great foundation for the development of the service platform which aims to help provide an insurance for customers at a relatively reasonable price ( which I assume will become even more affordable and therefore, profitable as they scale this area). Numbers in last fiscal quarter also suggest a growing revenue share in this area. As per the wearables technology, the watches are becoming increasingly adapted to the active lifestyle market, which is an attractive combination of both technology and sports. I don't see a big competitor in this space as Apple has already established such a strong foundation in this product and the dominance of it's competitors are disproportionately favorable for Apple.

On second thought, the airpods are also a great technology that they can expand on. Recently there is some buzz on earphones as a health product, by integrating technology that can monitor heart rate and blood pressure through the ear canal via the airpods. This makes a great deal of sense as the skin is much thinner in the ear passageway compared to the wrist that the watch monitors off of. Would be really cool to see if they can work with something like this, and perhaps even integrate a voice recognition system and a translating software (like Google) to make the airpods more than just convenient, but highly accessible. 

I'd assume that ER will do commensurately better than the previous year, and we should be seeing some great numbers to support this growth. ALSO! integration of AMD technology into their new macbooks are going to be big for gamers and tech enthusiasts who have largely been accustomed to the Intel processors for ages. AMD is also a grow and developing company and their potential in unison with Apple can be a game changer for the software/high performance gaming market that Apple can also enter into.

So, after a Christmas break I thought a follow up was in order.

Its all great going ahead and getting a random selection of stocks, but how did it actually perform?

So, I checked out how it would have done when compared to the SPY, using a buy and hold strategy, for the entire time since the last post. Using a portfolio of 100k, it would have returned  if bought and sold at close.

[100k simultion](https://preview.redd.it/6hdj3riv3nb41.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a774a4b50b08402742684d2bc059881c6bbe61a)

So we got the price data for our stocks over the past few weeks since my last post. FRAN shit the bed, and there is a number of really poorly performing stocks in the lower quarter of the data.

I haven't yet got around showing sentiment for the individual stocks yet. This should look pretty cool. If anyone has a better solution for time-series data, please let me know! I have been using yahoo finance, and its crap.

For the time being, $BABA and $MSFT have culturally different clientele, providing a favorable moat to $MSFT in the US and with allies (UK, EU, AU, NZ) and the Western hemisphere neighborhood (LATAM). Of course, that's before we get to PaaS, which $MSFT serves as a leader in some of the most cutting edge (AI/ML, IoT), and as the uncontested king of on premise and hybrid cloud in enterprises.

&#x200B;

* **THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX HATH SPOKEN:** Unless you're living under a rock, you've probably heard about JEDI and DEOS. The monopoly that $AMZN once enjoyed in the cleared space  is now in the crosshairs of \*\[the new\] big blue. This opens the door for Microsoft to gain all types of opportunities in the highly profitable federal space, and some of which it is uniquely positioned for with it's Azure Stack Hub and array of edge devices. Microsoft, with it's already deeply established sales and relationships with the DoD, will have no problems capitalizing on this opportunity. It's only just beginning. Microsoft can leverage a huge partner base, and don't forget that US defense companies can increase that leverage too.
   * Azure Stack Hub is a hybrid cloud platform by Microsoft that can be run fully disconnected and power containers (Kubernetes, Docker), other PaaS platforms (Pivotal CF, Red Hat OpenShift), and more. The solution has a multi-year head start in the availability in the marketplace, ahead of AWS competing solution Outpost - of which does not support fully disconnected scenarios.
* **O365, DYNAMICS, LINKEDIN, AND GITHUB ARE EASY MONEY:** $MSFT is enjoying the fruits of its acquisition(al) labors on one hand, and the easiest inflows of cash via O365, which will see increased growth as more cleared / defense onboard into O365 and dog-whistle Teams.
* **ENJOYS THE TAILWINDS OF A RECORD YEAR**: $MSFT and Azure are coming along from record highs, with yearly gains between the 50-60% respectively. If you're bullish on the S&P 500/DOW, you can be bullish on Microsoft - and expect it to outperform. Microsoft has enjoyed steady climbs after most favorable earning events, provided its largely institutional (\~73%) ownership isn't panicking.
* **ADD per** u/ryryshouse6 **THE GREEN BUTTERFLY AFFECT:** As ETFs, funds, and retail investors will continue to gravitate toward environmentally-friendly companies, $MSFT serves as a very attractive Software Service option for managers to justify taking or increasing stakes with $MSFT. Microsoft already enjoys an overall ""Leader"" ESG score vs. Software industry according to MSCI ESG Research 2019 report, not taking into account the recent $1b investment to go carbon-negative by Microsoft.

Well i hope you all are ready for part 3.

CPU TALK

\--------

Most cpu/graphics drivers are in fact not optimized for Nvdia/Intel contrary to popular opinion.

$AMD has made the last 2 generations of APUs(ps3,ps4,, xbox1) for consoles and now they're making the next gen ones also.

Most games are developed for consoles and optimized to perform well on consoles because of their custom OS; they are able to have access to the lower level hardware more efficiently than say a general purpose os like linux/windows.

For comparison, the only other manufacturer able to do this is $Apple because they make both their own hardware and software so the devices they make operate really well and smooth.

So what im driving at here is that most games are devloped with $AMD hardware in mind because most games also release on consoles, there are very few PC exclusives.

AMD will use their place as an industry leader to also promote the desktop gaming environment. Zen3 CPUS(RYZEN 4000) has now been leaked showing another 30% performance improvement over Zen2(Ryzen 2000 and 3000 series) CPUs on a 7nm+ node. 

\--------

GPU TALK

\--------

I have speculated the big navi was coming early this year because 7nm nodes at TSMC($TSM) have now been shown to have above a 90% yield rate meaning for every 100 chip produced, 90 work. Samsung and Intel fabs have much lower yeilds. leaks show that Samsung 7nm is at 30% yeilds.([https://twitter.com/chiakokhua/status/1208385778486628353?s=20](https://twitter.com/chiakokhua/status/1208385778486628353?s=20))

Now we know for sure that big navi is coming and we are looking at more than 400mm\^2 die chips. The 5700xt die size is 252mm\^2; that means big navi has more than 2.5 times the die size as the 5700xt. Get ready for some serious performance out of AMD GPUs. Without yields being 90%+ on 7nm this would not be possible.

\--------------

FAB HOUSE TALK

\--------------

So now Apple, ARM, AMD, Nvidia, and now recently reveled Intel(for their dGPU - [https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-intel-second-generation-dg2-gpu-to-use-tsmcs-7nm-node/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app](https://adoredtv.com/exclusive-intel-second-generation-dg2-gpu-to-use-tsmcs-7nm-node/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)) are using $TSM's fab. TSM is fully booked for their 7nm process and now Apple is booking them for their 5nm node. AMD and TSM have a monopoly on their respective markets right now.

My hot take is $70+ for TSM([https://www.tradingview.com/x/PnNWs2oW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/PnNWs2oW/)) and $80+ for AMD( [https://www.tradingview.com/x/2rdtOCur/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2rdtOCur/)) by 4/17/20.

This new Coronvirus has officially infected more than 200 people across multiple Chinese cities and also as far as Thailand, South Korea and Japan. 3 dead so far which have been heavily downplayed as they were over 60. Bro to bro transmission has just been confirmed.

China is likely suppressing these numbers, ICL puts the number of infected at more like 1700. If this is the true number we should start to see some real impact in behaviour and global fear. [ICL Report](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)

It's Chinese Lunar New Year, the most important holiday in their calendar to travel and see family, it's the perfect location and time for this to spread.

SARS infected around 8k at its height killing 10%, if these numbers get anywhere near that with more global coverage there will be some big moves. 

What to play before we all die from this fucker:

Travel Air China - weak already on this news, -4%

Anything to do with public area entertainment. Chinese Cinemas, theme parks etc etc.

Local Chinese Retail shops/centres.

Depending on spread / global traction these can move regionally to HK, Japan, etc.

Chinese healthcare - few of these local shares are already limit up 10%. Shandong Lukang Pharma, Shenzhen neptunas bio-engineering. 

Top pick: Shanghai Dragon corp: sick fucking stock name, also makes medical face masks and overalls. Unfortunately you can't buy unless you have a local account as there is no stock connect.

3M - global provider of face masks, speaking to local HK brokers these are already in high demand and hard to purchase. Also produces hand sanitizer.

Baba - people ain't gonna be buying shit outside are they.

RECKITT - 26% of revenues from china. Global producer of Dettol, hand sanitizer, all the cleaning stuff you have never used before.

Return on Assets is in the negative meaning the company loses money - which does not matter since the cashflow is still there, right?  Yes, but the cashflow is only there when there is money, right now money is flowing into Tesla, but investors are going to wake up soon.  Price/Earnings ratio is probably somewhere beyond 100 meaning the current stock price does not reflect the real value of the company (obviously).  People are soon going to realize that papa Musks company is a big troll, since they don't really have anything to offer except a few thousand poor quality e-cars - where other companies are catching up already.  The only thing they can offer is battery tech and the data they collected - but it is not worth as much as ppl think. 

**Shorting TSLA a good idea?**

No, definitely not.  I would even assume; the stock price will still go up based on all the stupid people and papa Musk still supplying capital to the company.  But in the long term it is a strongly overpriced stock (even technicals like the RSI are telling this) and sooner or later it is going to pop.

**Buying TSLA a good idea?**

Maybe, but maybe not.  The recent correction can indicate a trend reversal, or it is just a natural correction and the trend is going to continue.  But not a single technical instrument can tell for sure.   
 My guess would be, that the price is still going to go up, this is also based on a very strong resistance at the 500 line - the sellers have no momentum and were not able to break it when there was one.

**Conclusion**

No one can tell whether the stock is going up, down, sideways or in fu\*\*ing circles.  My suggestion is not to trade Tesla in any form and just watch the retards play.",2020-01-20 19:18:35

How this all pertains to US markets, I’m not quite sure... but if CNBC says that’s why the markets ~~kinda sorta not really~~ sold off, it’s gotta be true, right?

Anyway, I work with several Chinese nationals, and they said that this virus is breaking out because of the Chinese New Year that is coming up, and everyone is traveling over there right now. 

So to stamp out this type of outbreak, China takes your temperature at every train station and airport as well as any area where there is lots of foot traffic. If you’re running a fever you are isolated somewhere nearby in a holding room for 7 days to make sure you don’t infect people. If you fly into another region of China or return from another country you are sent home and your door is legit sealed off and you aren’t allowed out for 7 days. They do not fuck around over there and as you can imagine, don’t worry about invading people’s “privacy” when it comes to matters of health.

CNBC, MarketWatch, etc. are all warning that this virus could really “shock” the markets. I personally only see this slightly holding back the benchmarks broadly until everyone else realizes this is overblown (based on the progression of the outbreak so far).

If this virus really was part of why we closed red today, I don’t think we should worry about this long term.

SPCE has more than doubled in the past month and everyone is hype for it. Do you know why it's up? Speculation alone. Their operating income is $0 as they have never recorded a sale and their only profits from Q4 2018 to Q3 2019 came from issuance of common stock, more commonly known as dilution. 

&#x200B;

Now, the latest filings we have from SPCE are from November 12th, 2019 where their market cap was under $900 million and their stock price was just over $10. Now as we know their stock closed at almost $20 today, January 22nd, but their market cap has skyrocketed to over $3.8 billion. How has this happened? Dilution which means that the company is just pumping shares into the market. Per the November 12th filings SPCE had under 83 million shares outstanding, which includes insider shares and the float shares. Today though that amount is 196 million, which means they have more than doubled their total amount of shares on the market. Keep in mind that the only reliable guess of their cash balance is $0-$100 million, which is not nearly enough to really roll operations forward. If you're long for tendies be careful for the secondary offering to come out of nowhere and screw you hard. Best of luck betters.

$MMM makes masks that get sold in large numbers during wildfires and outbreaks, but might be too diversified to be affected too heavily.

A 2 to 5 percent mortality rate is quite high (normal flu is an order of magnitude or more below that). I wouldn't read too much into the patient profiles of the deceased yet; the fact that it has primarily affected 40 to 70 year olds to this point is to be expected (it's basically the demographic that frequents livestock markets). Unclear how the virus affects healthy/younger patients, but pneumonia doesn't need to kill to cause chronic problems.

If you were around for SARS last time around, you'd remember that fear of SARS meant that virtually everyone walking around Hong Kong, taiwan, etc. all had masks. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, mask sales added nearly $30M to $MMM's revenue in Q4 (of course, $MMM just made $31.97B in total revenue (ttm), so that's not the biggest dent).

Of note, my relatives are worried and starting to cancel flights to Asia in March and beyond. With new cases in Russia, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan (which China just blocked from the WHO conference), and the US, confirmed human to human transmission, and hundreds of millions about to travel and congregate in large groups for the lunar new year (China estimates 3 billion trips), this should take a few months to play out (SARS went for months, and everyone wore masks for at least a year).

179,DD,SPY Puts,-0.9731,esit41,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/esit41/spy_puts/,28,1579758458.0,"Ok, I know what you’re thinking: It’s a scummy bear, one of those people who wants me to lose money and for the world to end.

This is not the case. I’m actually bullish on the market and my year end price target for $SPY is 340.

However, we have come up too far, too fast. Since October 8th, $SPY is up 15% despite earnings growth this quarter being negative. 

PEG and PE ratios, despite being a stereotype statistic for bears, does have powerful predictive powers over the market and these ratios are reaching highs not seen in years.

The average RSI reading for the past three months is 68, whereas 70 represents extremely overbought levels. Usually 70 is a level only achieved for short periods of time at a rallies peak, but we have held this metric for months. 

Company earnings are up 1% since the start of 2019 while the market, even if measured at the most favorable point of the 2018 peak is still up 12%.

While I believe this year will be a positive one, we have come into this year with far too much momentum and I think today’s intraday trading pattern exemplifies that we are starting to slow down and turn the other way. We were at a 0.5% gain and trading strongly before investors started to sell throughout the day and into the close. This strongly contrasts with what has become the recent norm, trading up through the day and at least up into the close.

This leads me to how I’m trading this.

I believe the market will decline at least 5% within the next month, so I modeled my options positions to be nicely profitable in those conditions.

Firstly, I took positions in the VXX Feb 21 16 Call, which is currently trading for $40. If the market drops 5%, VXX (which currently trades at 13.55) would hit 19.10, representing a 775% return for the option which would effectively trade at $310. I modeled this price for the VXX based off the decline in August of last year.

Secondly, I took positions in the SPY Feb 21 325 Put. This option currently trades for $230. SPY currently trades at 331.31. If the market dropped 5%, the option would be worth $1,025, representing a 445% return.

Essentially, the combined profit (after subtracting your initial investment) would be $1,065 with a risk of $270, or a nearly 400% profit off of a completely reasonable drop of 5%. No one made a big deal about this when it happened in August, as these things are normal.

And I don’t want to inspire greed, but that’s if the market drops just 5%. If the market were to drop like it did in February 2018, your profit would ballon to nearly 1,100% of your initial investment.

I have about 7.5% of my portfolio invested in these options, and almost want to YOLO my entire account and see what happens. I’m sixteen years old, so I could probably make the money back, yeah?",2020-01-23 00:47:38

It is a supplier to a number of aerospace and space-sector companies like KRATOS, LMT, MRAS, NOC, NASA, AJRD, BA just to name a few. The company is small with a market cap of 350 million but has paid big special dividends in the past and insider ownership seems to favor such shareholder distributions. I believe this company is highly undervalued and could sell for 1 Billion easy based on compacity and future contracts. PKE is both a growth company and dividend giant the earnings look strong and the balance sheet is clean 144 million in cash no debt. It is currently expanding the manufacturing facility in Wichita, Kansas. The facility expansion positions PKE to grow within its existing business. While PKE is actively seeking M&A candidates stated by CEO at Nedham Growth Conference January 15 2020.

I picked up 10 contracts of the $340/60 strikes at market open and so far the return is phenomenal, but that's besides the point.

I punched out the numbers and found that Netflex subscriber growth hasn't moved much at all with the integration of competitive platforms via ESPN+, Disney, Apple TV, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc. This makes a lot of sense because much of the aforementioned platforms are only going to last several month to a year and expire without resubsciption. This is mainly speculative, but many of these services are actually paired with purchases of new cellphone plans and product purchases (i.e. Free Disney with Apple iPhone 11 purchase, Free Amazon Prime Video for Amazon Prime (making the video segment a non-factor), Hulu with it's year long $1.99 p/m subscription deal offered last Christmas, and ESPN+ which is mainly tailored for sports and no longer offers any viable content since pay-per view is always going to be an added cost). 

On the topic of cashflow, which is huge for Netflix and a primary driver of it's devaluation. In Q1 ER, they burned through $1.7B, and the expected for the rest of the year is going to be around $2.5. They said 2019 was the biggest cash burn year to get the platform on track by increase content value, ease of access, marketing, etc. Seems to me Netflix is making the adjustments to go cash flow positive. 

On fundamentals, a rising wedge is forming very healthily. But who cares about fundamentals lol.

**Its not like GOOGLE where the company is actually** ***work a fuck***, its because they have nothing better to do, because their jobs could be automated with code

what im saying is:

(1) this entire company could be automated with code, swear to fuck, what the fuck do you think google reviews are

(2) they have nothing better to do so they fuck in the hallways

This is an easy bet.

I needed to speak to this guy and learn the ways of the world.

Two weeks later I go up to Penn State for an alumni weekend.

On my way to Happy Valley I turn off at the Allenwood Detention Center that the feds got my boy held up in. 

Turns out the prison is really secure and the guy at the gate was really pissed off at me for trying to get in. He gave me a number I could call to get a prisoner id number so I could request visitation. 

Not expecting a response a wrote a letter expressing my admiration for him and asking if he would teach me.

He wrote back that it was kind of weird that I did that but would be open for a phone call if he ever had some free time.

This company has spent 15 years doing jackshit - literally they have 1 plane. You know whose moved faster than these guys?

* SpaceX (founded 2002) landed rockets on goddamn boats
* Facebook (founded 2004) figured out how to destroy democracy
* THE ENTIRE SMARTPHONE INDUSTRY STARTED 3 YEARS LATER
* America elected both a non-white person AND a reality TV star as president.

For crying out loud, a new Half Life is landing before these guys actually launch their service.

My point here is that this team has literally shat the bed for 15 years, I'm not sure what makes you think now of all times they're magically going to get their act together.

But maybe you believe that the revenue opportunity is massive - and they're just on the cusp of raking in all that cash.

*  SPCE has disclosed that they have ONE working plane. They have another that maybe they'll have by some time next year. They plan for 5 by 2023.
* They have plans for hypersonic travel - but thats more than 5 years out.
* At max they have 5 people flying per flight. They only make profit after the 2nd one, so you can back into at least how many flights they can have with their current list of 600. And any partially filled flights are going to drag on their margin.
* Also any unexpected maintenance really fucks with earnings when you have ONLY ONE PLANE.

BUT here's the rub - the really interesting bit is that they had to go through this SPAC process because they were running out of cash, and Richard Branson was tired of throwing his own money into a pit. What's crazy here is that instead of doing normal things (raising capital through an IPO, doing a round with any of the massive VC firms that clearly love pissing away money, raising debt, or looking for to be acquired) they opted for essentially a direct listing.

Why do it this way?

1. They probably couldn't raise the money (let that sink in - WeWork was probably a more convincing business model than this shit)
2. No one wanted to buy their IP (likely because its super nascent and all the decent engineering companies thought it was not worth the amount Richard Branson spent)
3. The easiest people to feed this garbage to are retail investors too dumb to do research.

AND LASTLY: Go to their fucking website. They're shilling Microsoft Edge. Any company that proudly boasts how deeply they've partnered with Edge does not instill any confidence in their technical prowess.

We know that Microsoft is developing several new data centers, as their cloud computing platform continues to grow faster than AWS. Intel confirms these growths are larger than expected.

IBM also confirmed a large growth in cloud computing.

This was the best single day gain IBM has seen in a decade.

There is a huge surge in new Windows purchases as well.

> In the first half of the year Intel will be able to sell chips as people upgrade to Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system — Microsoft’s support for Windows 7 ended earlier this month — and that factor will taper off in the second half, Swan said.

In addition to this, Microsoft Teams is growing faster than Slack, and their Office 365 special edition ran out of stock (limited subscription).

“We think Intel is benefiting from an improving macroeconomic climate versus company-specific improvements at this time,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves, who rates Intel’s stock at underperform but took his price target up to $56 from $48. If his thesis is correct, Steves said Intel would simply be riding a “rising tide” that’s lifting all data-center competitors, and he expects rivals Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.12%  and AMD to keep outperforming Intel by picking up share.”

When Micron reported earnings in December they announced the bottom of the semiconductor market. And, they believe with their recent expansion in sales that the market it finally turning up due to 5G. With 5G more things are going to go into the cloud than we have now and new businesses will be born from this. You need data centers to power this. Micron makes the drives to hold the data for the data centers. AMD and Intel make the CPUs to process the data. 

Intel reported 1 billion in growth from the cycle turning out. Analysts are shrugging their shoulders because the conference call said they will experience a down turn in the second half, which is strange for a company that just beat by 1 billion. The banks grilled Intel about this and they answered that it is due to competition and they made their numbers “conservative.”

AMD has released beefy 64 core processors so much cheaper than Intel and on 7nm technology, which Intel said won’t have until 2021. This is why AWS and Azure and even Google Cloud are buying so many of these processors. They get better margins for their investors and they get better efficiency. If the whole market is going up AMD has the most to gain because of this.

Wish I could I could attatch the spreadsheets I made which more clearly display the financial ratios of Target and its main competitors (Costco & Walmart). I am by no way an expert, and any constructive criticism is valued, especially if there is something I failed to miss or fundamentally don't understand.

&#x200B;

**Strengths**

* Target has a higher **gross margin** (26.32%) than its peers (Costco: 12.98%, Walmart: 25.10%). This means that the company retains more capital on each dollar of sales, which can be used to pay other costs or satisfy debt obligations.
* Target has an **operating margin** of 5.58%, meaning that each dollar earned in revenue brings 5.58 cents in profit. Because its operating margin is higher than its competitors (Costco: 3.16%, Walmart: 4.50%), the company a has a greater proportion of revenue available to cover non-operating expenses like paying interest.
* Target has a **net profit margin** of 3.89%, the highest of its main competitors (Costco: 2.40%, Walmart: 1.30%). A net profit margin of 3.89% means that for every dollar generated by Target in sales, the company kept about 4 cents in profit. Retailers tend to have profit margins that are lower than in other sectors, which can run between 0.5% and 3.5%.
* Target’s **price-to-earnings ratio** of 20.01 is relatively lower than its peers (Costco: 35.53, Walmart: 23.20) which suggests the stock is potentially undervalued among its main competitors.
* Target has the lowest **price-to-book ratio** (3.26) among its competitors (Costco: 8.50, Walmart: 3.80) which suggests its stock is undervalued. However, this alone shouldn’t be used to assess whether a stock is undervalued. It’s useful to consider the P/B ratio with the company’s ROE, as they both factor in the book value of equity. Because Target has a relatively low P/B ratio and a relatively high **return on equity** (25.47%), the company’s stock is likely undervalued.
* Target’s **price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio** of (2.48) is lower than its peers (Costco: 4.49, Walmart: 2.48), suggesting its stocks is more undervalued than its competitors.
* Target’s **price-to-sales ratio** of (0.50) is lower than its peers (Costco: 0.85, Walmart: 0.55) which suggests its stock is more undervalued than its competitors. Furthermore, when complementing the company’s low P/S ratio with its high **net profit margin** (3.89%), the same conclusion can be made.
* Target’s **price-to-cash-flow ratio** of (6.35) is lower than its competitors (Costco: 20.54, Walmart: 10.17). Although there is no single figure that points to an optimal P/CF ratio, a ratio in the low single digits may indicate the stock is undervalued
* Target’s relative low **enterprise value to EBITDA** of 11.25 (Costco: 20.06, Walmart: 11.37) indicates that the company may be undervalued

&#x200B;

**Good, but Not the Best**

* Target has an **interest coverage ratio** of 9.15, meaning it has around nine times as much in EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) as in debt interest. Although Target is more than able to cover their interest expense with their earnings, the company has the lowest interest coverage ratio among its top competitors (Costco: 32.15, Walmart: 9.67). 
* Target’s **return on assets** (7.30%) is between its competitors (Costco: 8.49%, Walmart: 3.15%). Every dollar that Target has invested in assets generates 7.3 cents of net income, Costco 8.49 cents and Walmart 3.15 cents. This means that Target is better at converting its investments into profits compared with Walmart but not as good as Costco.
* Target’s **return on equity** of 25.47% is significantly higher than Walmart’s return on equity of 8.87% but slightly less than Costco’s return on equity of 26.10%. A return on equity of 25.47% implies $0.25 returned on every $1 invested. Target’s relatively high return on equity suggests the company efficiently uses its stockholders’ equity to earn profits.
* Target’s **earnings per share** of 5.56 is between Costco’s (8.32) and Walmart’s (2.28). With a higher earnings per share, we can assume that Target is performing better than Walmart in terms of profitability. This is also reflected in the gross profit margin and net profit margin 

  

**Weaknesses**

* Target has the lowest **quick ratio** (0.20) among its peers, with Costco’s and Walmart’s quick ratios being 0.52 and 0.23, respectively. With a quick ratio under one, the company does not have adequate current assets to cover short-term obligations. However, this is not a significant issue, as the retail sector has traditionally had a very low quick ratio. Companies leading the retail sector typically negotiate favorable credit terms with suppliers due to their dominance over the market.
* Target’s **receivables turnover ratio** of 74.28 is much lower compared to its competitors (Costco: 95.32, Walmart: 86.48), indicating that the company’s collection of accounts receivables is inefficient, and that the company has a high proportion of customers that are either not financially viable or creditworthy. Whereas it takes a around four days for Costco and Walmart to collect its accounts receivables, it takes Target about five days to do so. 
* Target has a significantly lower **inventory turnover ratio** (5.90) than its peers (Costco: 11.80, Walmart: 8.80) which means the company is selling goods at a slower pace and there is less demand for the company’s products. It takes Target approximately 62 days to sell its inventory on hand while it takes Costco about 31 days and Walmart about 41 days.
* Target’s **asset turnover ratio** of 1.88 is lower than its competitors (Costco: 3.54, Walmart: 2.43), signaling the company is not efficiently using its assets to generate sales. For every dollar in assets, Target generated $1.88 in sales, while Costco and Walmart generated $3.54 and $2.43, respectively. Target’s low turnover may indicate that the company is experiencing sluggish sales or obsolete inventory. Furthermore, its low inventory may also mean the company the company has lax collection methods.

**The Bottom Line:**  In comparison to its peers, Target Corp. struggles to effectively use its assets and manage its liabilities in the short-term. The company’s collection of accounts receivables is inefficient, likely a result of lax collection methods, it sells goods at a slow pace, possibly due to less demand for its products, and the company may be holding obsolete inventory. With regards to liquidity, Target and its top competitors all have a quick ratio of less than one which would indicate that the businesses are not able to meet short-term obligations. However, this is not an issue, as large-cap retailers typically negotiate favorable credit terms with suppliers due to their dominance over the market. The company outshines its competitors in terms of profit-generating abilities. Target retains a great deal of capital on each dollar of sales, it has a large proportion of revenue available to cover non-operating expenses, and it keeps a considerable amount profit for every sale it generates after accounting for all expenses, costs, and cash flow items. Although not up to par with Costco, Target is better able to convert its assets and stockholders’ equity into profits than Walmart. Finally, when examining the company’s market prospect ratios, Target appears to be undervalued when considering its low market value ratios (P/E, P/B, PEG, P/S, EV/EBITDA). 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Overall Costco seems to be the best business to invest in with Target being a close second. That said, right now Target looks relatively undervalued in comparison to both companies.",2020-01-26 05:32:51

Anyways, let's ignore all that.

And, now let's look at the [CPC numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak#Phylogenetics) and assume its correct (i.e. best case scenario):

> - Day 1 (starting 16/1/20): 45

> - Day 2: 62

> - Day 3: 121

> - Day 4: 198

> - Day 5: 291

> - Day 6: 440

> - Day 7: 571

> - Day 8: 830

> - Day 9: 1287

> - Day 10: 1975

> - Day 11 (26/1/20): 2504

Okay, quick maths (yes, I know u guise suk at maths):

Let's take the average growth rate of when quarantine started (23/1/20; 45.17%), under the clumsy assumption that growth rates at that point would be more accurate, and extrapolate that to day 30.

The **result is that we have 2,978,758 people infected, and 89,363 people dead (3% death rate based on CPC figures)** after 19 days.

But hey, maybe the growth rate in that period wasn't accurate.

Let's take the average growth rate of all 11 days.

The **result is that we have 5,926,898 people infected, and 177,807 people dead (3% death rate based on CPC figures)** after 19 days.

For reference, SARS infected 8,098 people and killed 774 over 1 year and 10 months, according to CPC figures.

1. \[Weak - Med Evidence\] China has a history of covering up bad numbers to try to fix problems and ""face""
2. \[Very Strong Evidence\] Look up ""Hospital"" in Wuhan. I came up with 18-19 hospitals on Google Maps in just the city center alone, and those are the only ones that are on the map. Looking a bit further, there are many more hospitals on the vicinity of the city center. There *may* be more not on Google Maps. If we take the ""Total Infected"" in China which is reportedly around [1975](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-china-latest-updates/2020/01/26/4603266c-3fa8-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html), That means on average we're getting around 103 patients per hospital. You're joking right? Here's a [link](http://www.rmhospital.com/896/8963.aspx) to just ONE of the hospitals in Wuhan. For this one singular hospital, the google translate is telling me there are 1,200 beds available. BUT ALL THE HOSPITALS IN WUHAN ARE OVERCAPACITY? The doctors and nurses are all [freaking out](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/etpveg/chinese_doctor_in_the_city_of_wuhan_in_tears/) about how there's no room apparently. So you're telling me one hospital has a 1200 person capacity, its over filled, there are 17-18 more hospitals in the city center, and there are only 1975 people infected? Even accounting for other diseases, that is still a huge margin to cover from 1975 people.
3. \[Further Evidence\] Apparently, we don't know if this is true or not, but a nurse/doctor in Wuhan just posted a video claiming 90,000 people are infected. She says there is about a 1:14 ratio where if one person is infected, 14 more will get infected on average. Here's the [video](https://twitter.com/terrence_str/status/1221100970521829377?s=21). 90,000 people would fit the number of hospitals in Wuhan much more. In fact too much. If we're assuming an average 750 bed capacity for all the hospitals in the city center, that would be about 14750 bed capacity for hospitals in the city center. There are other hospitals in the vicinity of the city as well so that would be maybe 3x more if we go on all sides. That's around 50000. She is claiming 90,000 (btw we don't know where she got that number from, but it makes more sense), which is much more than the government reported number, but it make a lot more sense than 1975.

So basically that's why I think this might be much worse than anticipated. Let me know what you think or if you have further evidence to present.

NIO has the opportunity to stand on the shoulder of a giant and do what Tesla has done, but do it better. Let me list off a few points of what's made me bullish as fuck on them:

- Gone from concept to mass production faster than Tesla
- CEO and founder William Li believes they will turn a profit faster than Tesla
- Has NIO Formula E Team, a professional European sports car racing team that has set multiple records at world-reknown racetracks
- Backed by the Chinese fucking government
- First production car to have an interactive proprietary artificial intelligence, NOMI
- Has their own clothing collection, NIO Life
- Fucking in-seat massagers
- 5 minute battery swap stations
- NIO house, a showroom on the first floor with 3 more floors of community center space, look it up!
- 200 planned NIO House/NIO Space showroom openings in 2020
- Developed a driverless car while waiting for driverless tech
- Can literally use Tesla's shared IP to get a competitive edge 
- Shared environmental preservation sentiment as Tesla, their name in Chinese literally means Blue Sky Ahead 
- NIO Service, can charge your car/swap the battery for you while you sleep if your home does not have a charging station
- Cheap as fuck right now because people think they're going to run out of money

They're about to be even more heavily discounted over the next few weeks due to some hick ass bat soup disease. Gettin my money ready to wade deeper into the communist waters of China. You should to! Imagine being able to get into Tesla when it was this cheap. 

Tesla is more than a car company you say? So will NIO be I believe. They, like China, have a far future in mind. They're looking to the horizon while others are looking at today. It's a company I have come to love and will stand by.

***What to do right now***

If you own any Chinese stock, get out of your position right now. If you have any calls that expire within the next few weeks, I would strongly advise you exit those as well. Protect yourself from further losses immediately. 

***What to watch for***

Keep your eyes and ears peeled for the apex of viral infection. When numbers of infected peak and level off, you may want to consider getting back into the market. 

***What to buy right now***

Right now buying puts on most individual Chinese stocks and indexes should prove to be fruitful. Better to get them now rather than later.

***What to buy later***

Any stock that was heavily depressed by the news, that you believe is undervalued and will rebound quickly. You may want to also keep an eye on American companies that manufacture in China. If this goes on longer than a week, their production lines will be affected and they will be ripe for buying opportunities later as well.

Some of my favorite stocks at the moment are Chinese. The big three I am most interested in are Luckin' Coffee, NIO and Alibaba. All are in and will continue to be driven into bargain territory this week due to the extended Chinese New Years Holiday and likely even further beyond that.

***What's the buy point***

This is hugely speculative, but here are my predictions on the best buying points for my three mentioned stocks above:

LK:

Attractive: $30,
Get In Now: $20,
Must Buy: $18 and below

NIO:

Attractive: $3,
Buy Now: $2.50,
Throw Your Money At It: $2 and below

BABA:

Attractive: $200,
Buy Now: $160,
Mortgage your home: $135 and below

***What does all of this mean***

It means you have the buying opportunity of the year or possibly even years in these stocks. As long as the virus doesnt kill off too many people, the Chinese economy will bounce back even stronger and your profits will swell along with it. 

***Final Thoughts***

Keep your cool and focus on profiting in these market conditions. Many opportunities are presenting themselves, have the calm sense to realize what they are. I have already eaten losses myself. If you have too, pick yourselves up, pat yourself on the back and get your ass back in the game

Best of luck to all my WSBros and well-wishes to all those who are suffering in China from the direct and indirect effects of the coronavirus.

Edit: formatting, added tl;dr

TL;DR - Exit chinese market immediately, buy after viral apex, profit

Edit: FXI puts also a great idea!

How long will trading rest on coronavirus news? It’s simple math: the 2 week incubation period minus the attention span of the average bull tells us this news should blow over by Wednesday. TBH the virus will probably not be resolved and contained for another month, but that doesn’t mean we won’t start trading up on “virus talks going well”.


Anyway, some updates on the happenings in China that remind me to btfd:

Almost every city is under quarantine with cities having giant trenches dug around the city to prevent traffic in addition to gates/walls going up to prevent foot traffic.

In other parts of the country vehicles are constantly being hit with disinfectant sprays (like a car wash).

China is insanely efficient. They have pulled doctors from all over the country to fight this. I truly believe they have this under control within their own borders, but the problem ultimately rests with us and other countries that have seen patients show up.

I will mention however, one of my coworkers from the mainland said that the Wuhan region is surrounded by forested areas and thus lots of wild animals etc. and that after SARS in 2003 they predicted the next outbreak would be from that area because of this. Well here we are. He also said “in some of the southern areas of China they eat everything that flies except the plane, and everything on the ground except the train”. So you can imagine how easy it is for outbreaks like this to occur. Not great to hear...

Also, reports on the 2014 crash that killed a pilot indicate that they have a serious problem with their engineering culture. Most of the engineering talent came from Scaled Composites, where they would design prototypes or demo vehicles. Apparently this engineering mindset of prototype design has followed through to their production vehicles, where they will find and solve problems *as they come up*, rather than having detailed procedures for testing and troubleshooting.

Given the fact that SpaceShipTwo has been in development for well over a decade with still no paying customers flying (the first flights have been months away for a decade now), it's pretty hard to believe that they'll develop an *orbital* launch platform anytime soon, especially considering there are similar launch vehicles for similar prices already.",2020-01-27 19:58:36

But predicting the psychology of the mob, is sometimes much easier. The introduction of coronavirus into the most bullish stock market and economy of all time presents an interesting opportunity where I feel that we can predict a market downturn as well as the timing of said downturn, with just a little old fashioned psychology, and publicly available facts.



#Predicting the future is hard

I do not know how many people will die from Coronavirus. I do not know the eventual death rate. I do not know the probability of a full scale pandemic. Neither does anybody else, really. So this point does not stand against me. 

#Predicting the mob is easy.

People read the news, still. This news seeps into their mind and subtly changes the way their fingers interact with their big swinging hedge fund dicks, and Robinhood portfolios. Hedge fund managers definitely still read the news, even if you autists don't. What's my point? The news media is wildly misrepresenting the current situation with the Coronavirus. Dipshit journalists will cite things like ""the flu infects more people than corona"" or ""death rate of only 3%"" as if these are not wildly naive statistical calculations. What's my point? When corona has infected more people than SARS(should be the case in just 2-3 days), you will see very panicky headlines stating that fact. When the US shuts all travel to China, journalists will likewise create a broad sense of panic. People will take to social media and become aware of the scale. This will create an atmosphere of panic. When the virus starts to slow down, and things are actually getting better, in a twist of irony, the sample mortality rate will creep up. This is a basic statistical fact -- as the growth remains high, the mortality rate will be understated as the population is predominated by relatively more healthy recently infected persons, and as the growth rate slows, the mortality rate will approach reality. 

As these facts become more widely known, optimism will turn to panic. Future surprises with Coronavirus to be negative! That is the nature of this kind of thing. Dr. Taleb has done some great work on this subject which I recommend.

#Coronavirus will have some impact on S&P 500. 

The fed is pumping money to all time highs. We are in the most bullish stock market of all time. All we need is a little fear, and the change in animal spirits will be self-reinforcing. The economy is slowing despite the roaring stock market. In addition we have the real economic impact of shutting down large parts of China, cancelling travel between countries, etc. Even a small change to absolute GDP can mean a  relatively significant change to a quarterly growth rate figure, which is what moves the markets.

#Will Coronavirus spread to Europe and the USA in a significant way?

I hope not. I don't think my thesis depends on it. I'm not here to fearmonger. However, I absolutely recommend taking minor medical precautions with some awareness that this is a possibility. For instance, if you are a gross person who does not wash their hands, maybe now is the time to learn. (don't sell your 401ks people!!)

#What is the timing of these puts?

Seeing as how the virus has to slow down in the next 40 days or infection rates will be higher than the entire world population, you are safe with puts that far out. I am going a little earlier, because I feel that surpassing SARS will be a critical psychological point. What strike? Fuck if I know. Go with something that's not too hot, not too cold, just right. The baby bear amount. (whose name has been unrightfully stolen by that human bitch Goldilocks who steals from innocent bears!!)

Absolutely not. I am a dipshit with an internet connection, not Mr. Dow Jones himself.",2020-01-29 03:47:11

Coronavirus will have nominal impact on the operations and manufacturing end in China because the government has placed heavy sanctions against intercity and intra-city travel. Containment is in full effect now and biotechs are currently racing for a vaccine. This will likely improve relations between China and the U.S and Trump has extended a hand to help the Chinese. Double the win. Let's not forget their service-side and wearables department expanding at an unprecedented rate.

PYPL - I love this one a lot. Paypal's integration into China's Union Pay is massively undervalued. The potential for both parties is extremely important. The exchange of data across the two platforms will be valuable for advertisers and the retail industry to tap into consumer appetites and trends. For those that don't know, Union Pay is the largest Chinese financial services company. Works much like a bank and is offered as a form of payment at many destinations across the U.S. However, there are fees associated and they are not made available for online retailers in the U.S. That being said, Paypal fills this gap very nicely. The Chinese, known for their appetite for purchasing American products and brands are going to rave all over the ability to access Paypal and American online retailers. The only thing left to do for them is to partner/buyout a logistics company that will set up the right network for them to ship goods into China.

SBUX - Said it before and will say it again, I took profits from my early January buys and rolled them into safer $88/90/92.5 Calls. Currently sitting at a very small profit but I have a month out for some and 2 months for the others. It's been a pretty hectic week for this ticker because of the Coronavirus fears which will likely impact their sales in China because the 4,000 locations they have in China are going to account for a maximum of a quarter loss in revenue (only if they literally do not get any sales at all). But all that aside, I think this stock is positioned well for growth with their monopolization of the domestic market and their growing marketshare of the Chinese/global markets. Can't wait to see an outpouring of support for this stock soon. Rock on!

But Tesla is going to be an exception this year for the auto industry.

After coronavirus, we should see people frantically trying to buy cars because they don't want to take subways. People don't want to be in enclosed areas with thousands of other people. This fear will continue even after the virus is contained. They still need to get around though, and that's where cars come in. 

Problem is that having petrol cars, especially in major cities, comes with large costs that put off people from buying one. EV cars get around a lot of these costs. The biggest incentive is license plate quotas. In Shanghai and Beijing, license plates are on a lottery system and the cost can be almost as much as the car itself. Millions of people will want a car RIGHT NOW, they don't want to wait year after year to win the lotto and get a plate. They don't trust subways and buses, they are scared for the next epidemic, and they want a car as soon as possible. So what do they do?

# They buy an EV.

Tesla is ahead of all other EV companies, even the ones in China. They've undercut NIO, their products are superior to products from BYD, and many of the models by Chinese car companies are built like compliance cars. The XPeng P7 may be able to compete on cost and value, but they don't have the capacity to supply cars to the millions of customers who want an EV this year. 

Tesla has the supercharger network that they are ramping up this year in China. This is a huge advantage over other companies, because a Tesla owner can use both the supercharger network and the current charging network built by the government and third parties. Most people in China live in apartments, with limited access to charging at home so charging infrastructure matters more than most places.

Tesla will be building its own batteries. They don't have to worry about battery constraints as the other competitors do. They're going to be able to bring down the price of the most expensive part of an EV lower than their competitors can acquire, and it's going to get even lower. As scale of production ramps up, Tesla can increase its marginal revenue holding prices constant, because the cost of each Tesla they produce is going down. Labour costs are also cheaper in China. The more China slows down, the slower cost of labour goes up.

The price is right. $46,000 USD seems high, but millions of people in China spend that much just to buy a regular petrol car along with the price of the license plate. Large families (most likely to buy a car because they don't want their kids getting kung flu from the subway) pool their money for large purchases, enabling them to buy houses and cars without financing. 

Out of all EV car companies, Tesla will be the one on top.",2020-01-28 20:19:41

Without a doubt, UNH will be a very busy company over the coming 2-6 weeks. This isn't a good thing, though.

As I'm sure you all know, UNH is a health insurance provider. These guys make their money when somebody is insured by them, and doesn't have any reason whatsoever to see a doctor. Their ideal client is someone who pays premium and never gets sick. Their ideal quarter is one in which every hospital in the country is empty. Their ideal country is one in which everyone has to pay for the service UNH provides, but never actually uses it. They make the most when they have to do nothing at all.

UNH is Theta gang, who sells premium against disease.

Whether you think that the Wuhan Flu is an actual issue or not, one thing is certain: people are frightened by it. Although most times people just ""shrug off"" cold like symptoms, with the recent sensationalist headlines, there will be an unexpectedly high amount of clinic/ER visits for silly little runny noses and other bullshit. Although these won't be bonafide Wuhan Flu cases, UNH will still have to pay out for the MD/hospital services rendered. If WuFlu actually DOES end up being something... just look up the daily cost of an ICU visit to get an idea of the claims payouts UNH might be looking at (**HINT**: It's about a cyber truck per week).

Furthermore, it's looking like there is a growing threat to UNH's very market niche. There is rising fear and uncertainty in the market that there will even be a **role** for UNH if Bernie implements universal health care. Whether you think public health care is a good idea or not, and whether you think Bernie might/should be president, it's clear that there is a growing possibility that American health care may join the rest of the developed world with a public health system. If this happens, would UNH even have a product to sell?

If health care goes public, UNH and others will be left with nothing other than their dicks in their hands. Their sole product will become obsolete. Imagine being a horse shoe salesman when Henry Ford popularized the car. Imagine being a slide rule manufacturer at the advent of the personal computer. Despite currently having a $30B market cap, UNH could possibly be left with the same valuation as $LEH.

UNH is theta gang, during the world's largest health care scare in over 15 years. They're Abacus Inc., just as a new calculator shop is opening up down the street. Yet somehow, they're trading at just about 5% below ATH, and near the top of their 52wk range.

In terms of U.S. supply API mentioned that the U.S. is going to decrease oil production by 4 million barrels a week and OPEC agreeing to cut production as well.

I believe that with their growth rate slipping on revenue they will not be able to meet the expectation. I seem to be in the minority on this as everyone seems to be expecting a great earnings and maybe even a beat.  I just wanted to hear from people who are thinking SHOP will beat or what you think will happen on earnings. (Feb 12th before market open)

The specifics of my logic is based on the fact that Q4 growth seems to be slowing about 16.5% every year with the last 3 years being 85% (2016), 71% (2017), and 54% (2018). I think its realistic to think we would actually see a growth of around 44% which would translate into roughly $470M which is below the estimates range of revenue which is 475.45M - 493.14M.

So come on bulls tell me how my options are gonna end up worthless. IDC I'm holding.

So maybe that's why lock-up expiration is Feb 24th (after they report earnings).

2. They do not recommend restricting travel to China

* Only patients with Wuhan travel history and symptoms are tested.  
* Incubation period is around one week, after that weakest die around one week since showing symptoms.

So theoretically there a lot of ramen virus carriers in the U.S. who are incubating, transmitting and some of them already starting to show mild symptoms, but they think it is regular flu and they are not tested because they don’t have any connection to China. Tests are expensive, they are not performed on all patients showing flu-like symptoms.  

Current timeline:  
China has detected new virus mid-December,  then closed bat soup market on Jan 1st when they had 41 confirmed case, then got first death on Jan 10th.  
U.S. got first patient confirmed by test on Jan 21st.  
On Jan 29 we had 5 confirmed patients with symptoms - that is similar to situation in China mid-December.  

Prediction:  
If we apply direct approximation, around Feb 14th U.S. should have 40 lab-confirmed patients, then around February 25th U.S. will have first death due to Wuhan virus.  
Mid-March U.S. might have 100 fatalities when government enacts quarantine of L.A. area with Cybertrucks blocking all roads in and out.

Market volatility is brewing and bubbling. 10 days of closed markets in Shanghai have backed up market volatility so high that it is going to come spewing out and spill over to all the other asiatic markets.

It will be equivalent of that scene in Stand By Me when everyone is throwing up on each other except coming out of Chinese companies assholes.

People saying it's already priced in because things are already trading down on other markets are going to be sorely disappointed and left putting vaseline on their anal fissures from getting fucking so hard.

Get your puts in on anything Chinese. My choices are on index funds. Here's what to play:

- Puts on EWH (cheapest)
- Puts on FXI (cheaper)
- Puts on YINN 
- Calls on YANG (it's an inverse fund)

Once you make your money, consider feeling out the market for the bottom and buy back in on Chinese equities or calls there on out and ride the market back up. 

Despite being a third world country in many parts of the countryside and causing this kind of fucked up market volatility in the first place, China's middle class is larger than the entire population of the United States. You won't lose in the long run by betting on them to succeed.

- Luckin Coffee
- Alibaba
- NIO

Here's a series post about making some serious cash. 

***What's Happening?***

The Wu-flu epidemic is far from cresting. The Chinese markets are closed and will be closed through Monday. The reason the markets are closed for this extended period of time is to avoid market volatility and prevent the Chinese market from crashing.

What is happening is the opposite, at least where volatility is concerned. It is building up and will pop when and if the markets open this coming Monday.

I am encouraging everyone to get in on this. Even if it's a small pop, it will be a pop. If it's a big one, then we clean up and everyone has a good day except the artistic inverters.

***What's The Play?***

Buy puts on FXI. That's the play. Play it how you like it. I'm already in and waiting to hopefully make some nice tendies come Monday. I would consider buying them a little bit out in the case that the Market gets an even further delayed opening.

Credit to u/Leaky_Buns for the play. He's been saying it all over the sub for the past few days and I think he is correct.

***Where's The Proof?***

*Taiwan and Hong Kong Markets Take a Hit*

The Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets both opened this week to about -6% and -3% respectively after their return from the lunar holidays.

They are both continuing to drop. They are heavily reliant on the Chinese economy and should be a good indicator of what will happen once Chinese markets open. 

*Increased Infection Rate*

There's also the fact that the rate of infection is not slowing. Look at this graph from Johns Hopkins University and you'll see the number of reported infections has been increasing exponentially and will likely continue to do so.

https://imgur.com/gallery/OMMZHON

*Businesses Staying Closed*

> Hubei authorities announced late Wednesday that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 13.**

> This week, Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang announced that businesses are **not to resume work till midnight on Feb. 9.**

Excerpt taken from the CNBC Live Updates page linked below.

*Viral Infection Not Contained*

> ""But the disease has spread far and wide inside China and, with extensive worldwide travel by its citizens, especially during the celebration of the Lunar New Year""

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/health/china-coronavirus-outbreak.html

*Months Until Vaccination Trials Begin*

> Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the N.I.H., who oversees Dr. Graham’s team, said he expected the vaccine research to move quickly.

> “If we don’t run into any unforeseen obstacles, we’ll be able to get a Phase 1 trial going within the next three months, which will be record speed,” he said, referring to early human trials that test for safety.

> With each new outbreak, scientists typically have to start from scratch. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months from the release of the viral genome to get a vaccine ready for human trials. By the time an epidemic caused by the Zika virus occurred in 2015, researchers had brought the timeline down to six months. Now, they hope the joint efforts will cut that time in half.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/health/coronavirus-vaccine.html

The virus is not under control.

***Interactive Virus Map from Johns Hopkins University***

This is a handy tool to use to track the viral data on a cool interactive map. It is sometimes a few hours behind, but you can get a near perfect sense of the aggregated medical data available.

Credit to u/hello-world-foo-bar for posting on the sub a few days ago.

Estimates would be at about $60 a share for the buyout, and at prices currently $32.38, there's a ton of money to be made.  The FDA advisory board voted 7-2 in favor of the drug, and while that doesn't mean it's guarenteed to be approved, drugs with the advisory board's support pass 90% of the time!  So there's a 9 out of 10 chance we will be making tons of money!!

Palforzia is a great bandaid, but not for everyone, and with this treatment being geared toward motherfucking kids, I think it's really important to be sure about what you're doing. 14% of the participants in the clintrials (52 people) still had to be injected with epinephrine. Epi pen injections fucking suck, and for kids, it's scary and traumatizing and dangerous.

If you're super interested on making a wicked long call on a peanut allergy drug, DBVT is rolling out a patch in August that does the same thing, but so far, no epinephrine has been needed.

Everyday it rises by 2000. Why is that so? And why is it worse than we think it is?

1. Because they don't have the capacity to detect more than 2000 a day. 

2. Increasing the number of cases slowly will allow them to develop a vaccine and help recover the markets, as opposed to instantly killing the markets by saying there are 100,000+ cases.

3. Fatality rate for the common flu is 0.005%, compared to Coronas 2-3%. Let that sink in.

4. A lot of people undoubtedly will have the corona, but the symptoms for them specifically won't be that bad so they'll never go in to get checked. Consequently, they'll keep spreading it around.  

5. You can be asymptomatic for up to 14 days after being infected with the virus. Next two weeks will be spicy.

I reckon corona will peak around 20th Feb, around which time markets will begin to stabilize.

I've held TSLA from under $200 until $650ish yesterday. I've now switched to a short position. I'm no expert, but my hunch is that this is a sort of mass hysteria. 

As far as car manufacturers go, their market cap is second only to Toyota. This seems absurd to me. I get it though, they're a tech company. They have a great public perception and a massive head start on a charging network. 

I don't think their self-driving AI is *that* advanced though. And if data is the issue, any big manufacturer can easily equip their new models with cameras and collect way more data real fast.

351,DD,WWE - Dropped 20% on Friday and still has a ways to go.,0.9784,exdmgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exdmgo/wwe_dropped_20_on_friday_and_still_has_a_ways_to/,51,1580624337.0,"Disclaimer:  I bought puts on Friday.  Pocket change for most of you but a chunk of my play around money.  I am just a guy with an internet connection so do your own research as well before dropping loads of money based on what some dude on the internet says.

TLDR:  Stock is down,  fires multiple execs on Friday.  Delivered lowered guidance and reports earnings this week.  Lots of indicators of a blood bath.  Puts and more puts.  They don’t own XFL so that can’t save them.

So on Thursday after hours WWE fired two of the their c suite executives and issued guidance that full year OBITDA was going to come in at low end of $180m range for year.  Stock dropped 20% of Friday.  Shit barely registered on most radars since the market decided to melt down.

Seemed like a good play for a dead cat bounce to make some quick money.  Until you look under the hood and it’s a case of how the fuck did this stock run up so far.  It has a 3.8b market cap with net revenue of likely under 800m a year.  It’s PE is 93.62 and it’s primary source of revenue is network and cable television.

The primary driver of its run up was announced deals with Fox for 1b for 5 years for broadcast rights and $265m a year for 5 years from
USA.  For a total of $465m a year in content rights,  this is significant increase over 2018 total of $269m.  Extra 200m in income is a huge deal.  

Except the numbers aren’t quite so clean.  From the WWE investor relations:

https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/news/press-releases/2018/06-26-2018-215923315

The 2020 chart shows $435 with 80m to be negotiated.  Which is $200m more than the 2018 chart.  However it’s projecting $311m for 2019.  End of quarter 3 this year they were at $209m.  So they would need $102m in order to hit the $311 number for the 4th quarter.  In order to hit $435 for 2020 that would be $108.75 per quarter.  

Since these are contracts let’s assume that they will hit the 110m for that number.  So that should be an extra 110m in operating income.  However they issued guidance for $180m in OIBDA.  So they are expecting an extra 108m in OIBDA.  All of which is tied up in the extra money from media contracts with the rest of the business actually declining by 2m.

That’s their numbers and quite simply put the year to date numbers are some bullshit when it comes to OIBDA because more than half of that number ytd comes from stock compensation which is accounting voodoo to make income look higher than it actually is.  Standardize that shit out and they made $16m of operating income.  

So if they can translate that extra $110m into bottom line it’s $126m for the year.  They have a 50m share float so EPS for the year in a best case scenario is $2.2 for a P/E of 24 at the current share price.

That is best case scenario assuming you can drag the extra tv money cleanly from one line to another and all other costs and revenues hold constant.

Which is almost certainly not the case since for the first time in 20 years we now have a competitive marketplace.  At the same time that WWE was debuting on Fox, a competitor was debuting on TNT.  Shalid Kahn (owner of Jacksonville Jaguars) and his son have launched a second professional wresting organization.  Despite the organization being smaller and without the level of clout, it provides competition for talent and has already signed at least 1 performer away from WWE.  I am not going to delve too far into the details on this as others will likely be far better educated on it, but that means a dramatic increase in costs for labor as there are now realistic alternatives.

Given how slim margins have been, see the above note of 15m profit year to date,  this is particularly bad.  The new TV deal may give them some breathing room but given that all other segments of the business have been declining quarter over quarter for multiple years  the growth picture is pretty ugly.  

Which points to this quarters results as being a peak from which things will decline as the broadcasting deal will not increase but other costs appear primed to significantly increase.  

Under these circumstances firing two of the top three people in the company prior to earnings release looks like a canary in a coal mine moment.  

Looking through the earnings live attendance for events only averages less than 6,000 people and in fact the live performances seem to break even cost or borderline negative.  As these live events provide the content for the television business there isn’t an option to reduce the number of events and maintaining a live production ensures that costs will remain high.  For a company with only 200m in cash on hand that’s a problem.

A negative earnings report at this juncture should cause a run on the stock and the firing of two executives seems to indicate that is exactly what is coming up.  Of particular concern might be if either of the television contracts have opt out provisions as performance has been steadily declining over the past few years.",2020-02-02 01:18:57

359,DD,Zealand Pharma - ZEAL - Flying under everyone's radar,0.9992,exz3kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/exz3kj/zealand_pharma_zeal_flying_under_everyones_radar/,31,1580722349.0,"  Going public on the NYSE in 2017, Zealand Pharma (ZEAL) has been a powerhouse stock especially over the past year increasing steadily from $14 up to its current $36.50. I believe the stock has not lost its steam and is set to exceed $50 within 9 months if it maintains its momentum.

Somehow, Zealand has remained under the radar of many investors despite the incredible growth over the past year. This pharma company with a $1.29 billion market cap only trades a daily average of 11,000 shares.

Steadily rising stock price combined with incredibly low volume is a great recipe for a large breakout. Positive news has caused massive spikes in value for the company as buyers come in fast in the past, and I see this trend continuing. 2020 has several large catalysts on the horizon which will bring the stock price towards $50 as the trend upwards continues.

**Cash Position**

The company had revenues of $4.4 million with operating expenses of $62.9 million leaving the company with a cash position of $225 million at the end of Q3 2019. Q1 and Q2 of 2019 saw net expenditures for operations at $41.5 million combined, representing a dramatic increase in Q3 operating costs.

The very minor revenues are not guided as they are result of licensing agreements with Alexion as well as royalties from Sanofi and do not make a significant impact on the bottom line. The company projects that expenditure will remain roughly around $60 million per quarter moving forward stemming from heavy research and development expenses as well as admin expenses.

Due to the current cash position and increased expenses seen recently, the company will likely be strapped for working capital by year end 2020. This will result in a public offering of new shares to bring in working capital to cover R&D expenses.

While typically we would see heavy backlash from an offering, looking at the price action the stock has risen following a capital raise/offering. April 1st 2019 the Company announced a $200 million offering as well as on September 5 2019 the company issued 3.957 million shares as a placement to raise $83.94 million. Both times, the company saw a rise in share price as seen below. Will the next substantial raise be any different? I think not for this powerhouse.

**Drug Pipeline**

Zealand has 10 solid drug candidates in their pipeline that are targeting six indications with an additional three indications undisclosed at this time.

The Company's main focus is gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases where they believe their peptide-based products can meet market demand. Peptides are an underutilized market that offer great patient benefits such as easy dosing with small volume subcutaneous dosing, reduced dosing frequency and highly specific to reduce side effects.

Most indications are still in preclinical and Phase I/II, however they do have 3 late stage indications that are showing great promise. Below are two that I will highlight and focus on as I believe they are the big drivers currently.

**Glepaglutide GLP-2 Analog for Short Bowel Syndrome**

Short bowel syndrome is a debilitating disease that affects roughly 40,000 individuals in the US and Europe according to market research. Leaving patients with gastrointestinal tract average length that is a mere 25% of the average persons, this leaves people with life-long dependency and at risk to life-threatening infections.

Zealand is developing a GLP-2 Analog (Glucagon Like Peptide) that was effective and well tolerated in Phase II clinical studies. With an effective half-life of approximately 50 hours, the company is targeting a once-weekly dosing system utilizing an autoinjector. 18 patients were selected for randomized treatment with glepaglutide and 16 completed the trial. Treatment with glepaglutide was associated with increase in TE (transient elastography) and ICG-elimination (indocyanine green).

In the 10 mg dose group, glepaglutide increased sCD163 (soluble CD163) by 0.44 mg/mL (*P* *=* 0.0498), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) decreased in the 1 mg dose group by 33 u/L (*P* *=* 0.032). CAP (controlled attenuation parameter), sMR (soluble mannose receptor), LBP (lipopolysaccharide binding protein), liver transaminases, and INR (international normalized ratio) were not affected.

Zealand found that glepaglutide shows signs of improvement in hepatic excretory function, but at the same time activate resident liver macrophages and increase liver stiffness. The excretory and the stiffness findings may to some extent relate to increased splanchnic blood flow which would not influence the marker of macrophage activation. How glepaglutide effected the liver status calls for further research in future studies and draws slight concern.

The results also suggest that glepaglutide may play a role in the restoration of the disturbed homeostatic feedback in the gut-liver axis and thereby SBS associated liver damage. Glepaglutide may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of IFALD for which no currently approved medical treatment options exists.

The Phase II study found that short-term treatment with glepaglutide induced increases in TE, ICG elimination, sCD163 as well as a reduction in plasma ALP, and total bilirubin. CAP and gut integrity as assessed by LBP were not measurably affected. Although there was no significant difference between the 1 mg and 10 mg dose groups regarding any of the above mentioned assessments, changes were primarily seen in the 10 mg dose group.

Essentially, the results met several endpoints for:

· Increase in intestinal fluid and energy absorption

· Significant reduction in fecal wet weight output

· Increase in urine production

· Increase in body weight

Zealand has enrolled its first patients in the Phase III extension study of glepaglutide for the treatment of SBS that will evaluate the long-term safety of treatment. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to glepaglutide and the study will enroll more than 120 patients across the US, Canada and Europe. The company is projecting results from the Phase III study in 2021.

The potential of this indication will allow Zealand to tap into a massive market that is more than $1.5 billion. The company is targeting USA, EU and Japan as the main markets for activity which are projected to grow at a CAGR of 27% through 2027 and reach an approximate $4.7 billion market size. With various treatments for SBS out there that dont quite hit the mark, Zealand is looking to capitalize on this opportunity.

**Dasiglucagon HypoPal Rescue Pen for Severe Hypoglycemia**

Hypoglycemia is a constant fear for diabetes patients on insulin therapies, with more than 6 million people in the US utilizing insulin. Approximately 40% of patients who have Type 1 diabetes experience severe hypoglycemia every year which results in roughly 300,000 hospitalizations annually.

Combating this, Zealand is developing the HypoPal Rescue Pen, a ready-to-use rescue treatment for severe hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia is an acute, life-threatening condition resulting from a critical drop in blood glucose levels associated primarily with insulin therapy.

Phase III trial demonstrates that a single dose of dasiglucagon rapidly increases blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes following insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The trial compares the glycemic response observed after administration of dasiglucagon with that of placebo and with reference to the current market competitor, Novo Noridsk's (NVO) GlucaGen, in powder form for reconstitution prior to injection.

The study achieved the primary endpoint as well as all key secondary endpoints which is an impressive feat. The primary endpoint was time to plasma glucose recovery (increase in plasma glucose of ≥20 mg/dL) from baseline without administration of rescue intravenous glucose. 168 subjects were included in the trial. 82 in the dasiglucagon arm, 43 in the placebo arm, and 43 in the GlucaGen arm.

The primary result demonstrates that the median time to blood glucose recovery was:

· Dasiglucagon - 10 minutes

· Placebo - median: 40 minutes

· GlucaGen - 12 minutes

Clearly, Dasiglucagon was a winner with a greater median time to recovery that was 17% faster than GlucaGen.

Additionally, 99% of subjects were recovered from the insulin-induced hypoglycemia within 15 min following dosing with dasiglucagon, versus 2% with placebo and 95% with GlucaGen. While not seeming too significant, it shows a more reliable recovery. Overall, no safety concerns were raised for dasiglucagon within the trial. Nausea and vomiting were reported with similar numbers for dasiglucagon and GlucaGen® (nausea: 55% and 53%, vomiting: 23% and 19%, respectively).

The submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. FDA is on track for early 2020. When looking at expenses, the bump of $20 million the past quarter can be related to the buildup of U.S. commercial operations which has been accelerated in the last quarter with recruitment for key leadership positions ongoing. Seeing substantial movement in price on the stock from positive announcement (over 6% that morning) approval from the NDA would send this stock to new highs.

**Additional Comments**

Zealand is also on a partnering spree, having acquired Encycle therapeutics and teamed up with Alexion and Beta Bionics, the company is spreading itself out into amazing groups.

With Alexion, Zealand has provided their partner with exclusive worldwide licenses for a preclinical target that allows for the option of up to three additional targets that are projected to start clinical development this year. Additionally, this will provide very key financial terms to Zealand upon certain milestones.

· $40 million in upfront cash and equity investments

· $115 million in potential development and regulatory milestones

· $495 million in potential commercial milestones

· Up to low double digit royalties on net sales

· Additional 3 targets provide $15 million upfront for each target with development/regulatory milestones, commercial milestones and royalties

Partnering with Boehrigner Ingelheim, can provide a combined $712.8 million with low double digit royalties on global sales for GLP-1/glucagon dual analog and amylin analog drug candidates.

**Summary and Thoughts**

The company is also in a good cash position but does project increase in operating expenses as it prepares for commercialization. There will likely be a raise in the second half of 2020 as it prepares to go to market and continue operations with the rest of its pipeline. The company does plan on utilizing partnerships with licensing agreements to offset some incurred expenses.

The market sizes are also a concern. The SBS and insulin markets are fairly well sized, but they do have a fair amount of competition. Zealand does offer greater results, but not a significant difference in my opinion. Comparing Dasiglucagon recover of 10 minutes with the GlucaGen recovery of 12 minutes, you must consider how physicians will alter prescriptions. Is that 2 minutes a significant amount that would cause the desire to change? If you are a patient suffering from hypoglycemia I would say absolutely. 2 minutes in that situation can feel like a lifetime.

The share price has been on a great run the past year, more than doubling with little sign of reversing. Positive news such as the NDA filing and updates to clinical trials or word from the FDA will bring volume to the stock and likely drive the price high. Large fluctuations in the share price are all off of low volume and positive news and new data could drive this stock up 10% or more.

I am bullish on the stock and would not change my stance unless the FDA denied approval. The management team is expanding and with the outlook of positive data flow in 2020 we should see a continuation of growth to a PT of $50. We may see an additional 100% growth in this next year like 2019 saw, but I am going to be optimistic but conservative with 30%.",2020-02-03 04:32:29

***News Recap***

If you haven't read it yet, [here's the article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-cenbank/china-to-inject-174-billion-of-liquidity-on-monday-as-markets-reopen-idUSKBN1ZW074).

There is no amount of effort the government can make at this point to prevent the tidal wave of sell-off that will occur. People need their money, companies need to stay afloat. 

The only major affecting factors that could happen, and are not likely, is that the markets do not open again and/or the government prevents stockholders from selling.

> There will be no further delays to the reopening, the securities market regulator said in an interview in the People’s Daily newspaper on Sunday.

That's one scenario out of the picture. The other is highly, HIGHLY unlikely and in any case, if they did, either it would only add to the surmounting volitility and negative market sentiment. 

What they **are** doing is preventing short selling. See [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-china-shortselling/china-moves-to-limit-short-selling-as-virus-looms-over-market-reopening-idUSL4N2A20FA).

This could potentially pigeonhole additional stockholders and traders into selling. We will see.

***Another Perspective***

Imagine you are a business owner or private citizen in China right now. In many regions, you are barred from working and isolated in an almost house arrest state of affairs. Your finances are unstable because you have been out of work on a mandatory extended vacation while a new strain of virus runs rampant over your country. 

> [“We can’t work and have no income. I would rather work than stay at home and do nothing,” said 32-year-old restaurant worker Wu Caixia in Beijing.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/china-seeks-to-boost-economy-as-first-virus-death-reported-outside-its-borders-idUSKBN1ZW00F)

Now, the markets are opening up, but with restrictions. You can sell. You can buy. You can hold. That's about it. No speculation. No bullshit. You have a straight exit to liquidate and get your money to help you and your family get through this uncertain and fearful time. What do you think people will do?

***What's Going On Now***

Uncertainty of the viral situation is still prevalent according to [this update](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/china-seeks-to-boost-economy-as-first-virus-death-reported-outside-its-borders-idUSKBN1ZW00F).

> The vice governor of China’s Hubei province, Xiao Juhua, said the virus outbreak was still “severe and complicated”.

> Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the risk of further contraction in the region’s economy, which was buffeted by anti-government protests last year, has increased due to the epidemic.
Catering, retail, tourism and consumer sectors, which have been hit in the last six months, would “fall into a deeper winter”, Chan said.

Many companies are extending their work suspension *voluntarily* through the better part of February.

> China Evergrande Group, the nation’s third-largest property developer, said in an internal note it would extend its Lunar New Year holiday to Feb. 16, and suspend construction work at all of its 1,246 sites until Feb. 20.

*Evacuations and Travel Bans*

Forgive the extended quote here, but it is pertinent to understand the complexity of the situation and evolution of events as they unfold.

> However, a string of countries have ramped up border controls. Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been to China from entering their territories, and Australia followed suit on Saturday.

> Russia will start evacuating Russian citizens on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported.

> The Philippines expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China, widening an earlier restriction that covered only those from Hubei province. Indonesia also barred visitors who have been in China for 14 days.

> More than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt on Saturday after being evacuated from Wuhan. Two of them had the virus, adding to the eight cases in Germany already in quarantine.
About 250 Indonesians were also evacuated from Hubei.

> Japan plans to send another chartered plane mid-week or later to bring back Japanese nationals who are still in Hubei, its foreign ministry said on Sunday.

> Japan has barred foreigners who have been in Hubei from entering the country. South Korea will impose a similar entry ban from Tuesday, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said.

***What's The Game Plan***

At this point you should already be invested in a variety of shorts on Chinese stock and ETFS. Some of these include:

- Puts on FXI
- Puts on YINN
- Calls on YANG (an inverse fund)

I am a big fan of hedging risk by shorting funds rather than individual stocks, but some of those may include:

- BABA 
- LK
- NIO
- TCEHY

While others may prefer airline stocks or financials, you probably will not go wrong in any case judging by the severity of the current climate.  Chime in and I will update with adding in your choice stocks/funds

*Am I Too Late?*

I don't think so. As things have progressed, the market is looking ripe for additional sell-off. It is likely that you will be able to get in on Monday or another day this week and still profit in the weeks to come. But do understand the risk you are taking having not been ahead of the curve by shorting the market last week.

You may be able to safely short the American markets at this point as well. **Production lines are forecast to be highly disrupted** from companies operating in China.

***Amount To Sell***

Originally my plan for this was to sell off 100% of my puts for tomorrow after Shanghai markets open up. I shifted to 50% late last week and now I am calling a 10-20% sell, to hold the remaining amount for further market sell-off.

This may change, but for now let's stick with it and see how Shanghai markets react later today. I may change my forecast to hold all puts. 

*Early Expiration Puts*

If your puts expire this week, I would highly consider getting out no later than Wednesday to protect yourself from market pushback. I always try to err on the side of caution, but play it by ear. I don't want to see you retards lose on a great play so close to proper execution.

***Final Thoughts***

Remember, Shanghai will be opening at 8:30pm EST today. Set your watches and clench your buttholes, this week should be extremely exciting.

Yours truly, LiquidityMan

Tl;dr - Sell 10-20% of your puts tomorrow, possibly 0% depending on market conditions. Market outlook is uncertain, prime for additional sell-off. May not be too late to get in on shorting the market.

***Updates***

Update: Feb. 2nd, 5pm EST - It looks like the Chinese government has done two additional things:

1. They are moving to prevent their citizens from shorting the stock market.

> China has taken steps to limit short-selling activities as the country’s financial markets prepare to reopen on Monday amid an outbreak of a new coronavirus, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters

2. They are preventing sales of stock bought on margin.

>  The sources said China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had issued a verbal directive to brokerages including Citic Securities Co. and China International Capital Corp. to bar their clients from selling borrowed stocks on Feb. 3.

**Update: Feb. 3rd, 1pm EST**

* Their own University lab [modeled the fatality rate](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.27.20018952v1.full.pdf) at 6.5%, comparable to SARS, and with a \~40% higher transmission rate than SARS
* Death does not occur immediately with infection, so simply comparing today's fatalities with today's infections does NOT yield the correct estimate. You need to project forward \~7 days which means the \~300 fatalities were relevant to the infection rate 7 days ago, NOT to today's rate. The same was evident with SARS: [https://twitter.com/chuckhasluck\_/status/1223373987624947713](https://twitter.com/chuckhasluck_/status/1223373987624947713).

If you came in early you still made profit. But when it comes down to the behavior we'll be seeing this week, GTFO out of FXI. 

The Chinese market does not operate like the US market. Chinese trading floors classify stocks in 3 categories.

A shares. Can only be traded using RMB currency. These are all your small cap, mid cap, and some large cap stocks. These stocks are the heart of China and represent Chinese health. They can only be traded by Chinese investors, and their exposure to foreign investment is highly limited.

B shares. Can be traded using foreign currency. They are mostly large cap, and are traded not just on the Chinese floors, but on foreign floors as well. Think Taiwan. Think Tokyo. Think Hong Kong.

H shares. Can only be traded using Hong Kong dollars and are traded on HK only.

Think about it. The Chinese stock exchanges were closed for 10 days. Those are the ones that hold the investments of nationals. Those are the ones that will be having massive sell offs due to sell order build up. Last night, the SSE and A50 (tracking A shares) reached the -8% almost instantly at open. Meanwhile, the markets that trade B and H shares (HK, Taiwan, and Tokyo SE) have all been open and those companies have slowly been bleeding out with no volatility build up. 

I can expect overnight behavior to be consistent throughtout the week. FXI/EWT/EWH/DXJ might keep spiking up due to the CCP liquidity injections going mostly towards the companies ""too big too fail"", that is, those that are listed on Shanghai, HK, Taiwain, Tokyo markets. Meanwhile, the smaller A share companies will keep tanking overnight as Chiense investors pull out to have liquid cash. I will close all my FXI/EWT/EWH/DXJ positions and go into ASHR/CHAU/KBA, which track both A and B type shares. 

If Im right, those will tank by tomorrow morning, while FXI will keep spiking up. Not worth the risk holding onto FXI at the moment. ASHR offers the same reward at much lower risk.

What we did not foresee is that apparently the PBoC infused cash into the largest cap companies, namely the ones in the FXI which many of us shorted.

Now, there are many paths we can take from here. The most popular is jumping ship and transferring FXI puts to ASHR puts to try and clean up from the continuing decline of the peripheral economy.

Shit is in [free fall over there](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/markets-in-mainland-china-plunge-9-after-layoff-losses-extend-across-asia-2020-02-02?mod=home-page) only to be caught in the lower circuit breakers of the market. Is this a one-day scenario? Probably not.

And the stocks are not the only ones in free fall. Many commodities [also hit their lower brackets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-russell-china-health-commoditi/chinas-commodities-got-smashed-as-expected-now-what-russell-idUSKBN1ZX0GX).

The problem is, we do not have numbers of how much money is going where from the cash infusions or how long they will last. It may be a safer bet to jump to ASHR as the government is not likely and perhaps does not have the ability to prop up thousands of smaller businesses that are feeling the pinch.

Facebook did their earnings and showed a strong growth in their other revenue section which is mainly coming from their Oculus Quest VR sales. This is only about 330m though, but this was for Q4 2019.

Qualcomm supplies the Oculus Quest with their snapdragon chipset. The Quest killed sales this year for Christmas selling out everywhere and had a ship date of mid-January around the end of December. This ship date continued to grow through January and is currently now March 3rd. This isn’t due to shipping delays but actual orders (I have a Quest and have just been in general watching the ship date/there’s continuing to be more players online).

Qualcomm will focus on 5g and those potentials, but maybe this added revenue can give them a bit of a boost/talking point.

Let me know if you’re playin it or if you have other good info!

TLDR; Calls - Qualcomm supplies Facebook chips for their Oculus Quest VR which sold hella so maybe it’ll boost revenue more than expected to help in earnings",2020-02-05 05:25:01

**The decline**

Intel is one of the most well-known companies in the world, its current market cap is well over 250 billion dollars. During the past two quarters, the value of each share has increased by about 8%, but as warning lights flash, the giant is turning towards a massive devaluation. During 2019, Intel increased its revenue by 2%, well down on the annual growth of 12.47% from the technology sector, and below the global average of 3.5%, despite trade tensions between China and the US. Infact, the global inflation was 2.3%3. Intel is losing ground, slowly, but surely, and is certainly not deserving of consistent 8% market cap increases for the past few quarters. 

Currently Intel’s technology portfolio is a complete and utter disaster, rife with stagnation, incompetence and underperformance. Directing our attention to Intel’s primary product, CPU’s we note that their entire product stack is woefully inadequate to compete in 2020, and potentially for years onwards. Their desktop platform is completely dominated by their one competitor, AMD, with twice the amount of cores being offered on the desktop platform, for 50% more, and 50% more cores at the same price when compared to Intel’s flagship 9900k. The only category in which Intel holds a slight advantage is gaming, thanks to a very high clock speed and optimisation for an Intel platform, however 5% is almost negligible due to other factors. Intel’s workstation class CPUs are completely decimated by AMD’s consumer products with their highest end workstation CPU being on paraty with AMD’s consumer CPUs. When taking Threadripper into account, the story is exasperated with AMD’s “midrange” workstation CPUs handley beating Intel’s single socket server CPUs which regularly cost half that of Intel’s server platform. However, the real “battle” is being fought in the server space.

**The server space, and Intel’s vulnerabilities**

Data security is key in the server space, and not a month goes by without a new vulnerability. 

2019 was the worst ever year for security, with well of 200 separate vulnerabilities being found. These vulnerabilities range from somewhat minor to being able to read directly from the cache of a cpu, remotely and being able to request specific information specifically with the newest MDS vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect all modern Intel server chips, with patches costing up to 70% of the initial performance, with in rare cases, greater than an 80% reduction. These reductions would be akin to buying a 10980xe, and over the past two years having the performance reduced to that of a quad core AMD CPU. 

Because of this, people have to scramble to buy new server capacity as, more often than not severs run at 90% capacity all the time. A 70% reduction is crippling, and it is very costly to jump providers and to migrate systems over to a new company, hence why AMD has slowly been capturing market share. All this will change with AMD’s Zen 3 architecture because the Zen architecture will be mature enough to be easier to migrate, and Intel will have *nothing.*

**A story of stagnation**

Intel’s 10 nm node was slated to launch four years ago. Four years is a very long time for any company, especially for the semiconductor space, and the sole reason why Intel was not severely punished for these stagnations was that they were miles ahead of any competitor. However TSMC ramped the 7 nm node extremely fast, handedly taking Intel’s previous position as owning the most advanced fabs. Looking at Intel’s road map, 10 nm will most likely hit market en of 2020, if there are no further delays, but TSMC is not sitting still, they are also innovating with the 5 nm node hitting markets in 2021. If Intel does not get 10 nm functioning by 2021, it will spell the end. TSMC will be not one, but two nodes ahead of Intel, if AMD gets to 5 nm before Intel hits 10 nm, expect to see at least 2-3 times faster CPUs in all categories when compared to Intel.

Drawing back to Intel’s vulnerabilities, it is noteworthy that Intel has not changed their architecture in any significant way since Sky Lake, way back in 2017, with little to no IPC improvements since then. Ice Lake is looking decent, but clock speeds are way down and it will be surprising if it can beat their current architectures in any meaningful ways. When compared to AMD, it is clear that a small bump in performance will not be enough when AMD is doubling cores every two years with a hefty IPC bump every two years. Intel does not have any good architecture, and any major revisements are years away.

**Meeting competition**

[Leaked internal Intel slide](https://preview.redd.it/xyiri8120ve41.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba9ff52ebbe2b4106f0859f13569c3e41d29e5c)

&#x200B;

We are all now familiar with Intel’s anti-competitive behavior, as noted previously Intel has never shied away from breaking antitrust laws to make end’s meet. Can you think of another time when Intel had a very similar program? Perhaps the MOAP\* comes to mind, with clear similarities in the monetary amount and clear parallels in the nomenclature, make of it what you will, but I smell a rat.

Benchmarks are the primary way of determining how a product performs, and Intel is no stranger to attempting to manipulate benchmarks. Casting our minds back to 2018, with the launch of the 2990wx, a monster 32 core CPU, Intel had to think of something. That something was a 28 core running at 5 GHz, soundly trouncing any potential competition from AMD. Of course they neglected to say that it was overclocked well over 60%, but this is nothing compared to what we have seen recently. 

A few weeks ago, AdoredTV published a video about how Intel is attempting to manipulate the benchmarks by optimising for AMD only, only performing in-house testing and violating the FTC’s ruling of including the disclaimer on all comparisons between AMD and Intel systems. Because of this, Jim filed an FTC complaint offering his services to the FTC, and after reaching out to him and asking for any potential updates he stated “I can't talk about any updates.” Make of that what you will, but I feel that it could imply the FTC has taken a deeper look into the case, and Jim has been asked not to disclose any details.

\*MOAP referencing how Intel paid billions to OEM’s to prevent them from using AMD’s products. If you want a more in depth explanation please watch Adore’s excellent video, “Intel - Anti-Competitive, Anti-Consumer, Anti-Technology.”

**The future**

Intel, for the next few years, is in a lot of hot water, potentially legally and technology wise. Their product stack is wholly uncompetitive, with little to no potential products being released in the near future, and they are well behind in any aspects of their core portfolio by potentially years. Intel could also be facing a series of legal battles due to them skirting the FTC’s ruling and by the potential meaning of their “meet competition slide”.

These findings do not include the woeful incompetence and power struggle that Intel insiders described to Adored’s most recent video. Furthermore, if there is enough interest I will make a follow up post more directly comparing Intel and AMD’s portfolio along with Intel’s GPUs with emphasis on the internal “power struggle” within Intel.

If you have any questions or I got something wrong tell me in the comments, also do not blame any of the people and or sources mentioned, all opinions expressed are solely mine, and may not reflect other’s.

1. Even with the surge it recently had through January, its still hilariously undervalued compared to its potential as the sole publicly traded company in a future multitrillion+ dollar industry. Thats a conservative estimate too. Once we start pushing the envelope with exploring and exploiting nearby celestial bodies, the economy and life as we know it is going to hit a singularity similar to the rise of the internet.  Even if Virgin Galactic stayed as nothing more than a space taxi through that boom, its position as an enabler with an established reputation and infrastructure would permit it to easily ride out the inevitable fluctuations when the space equivalent of the .com bubble pops.

2. Trump is pro space. With high odds of getting a second term, Space Force and the space industry as a whole is going to find itself in the limelight more and more, with inevitable bloated contracts being pushed through and money being funneled towards private companies who can get plausible bids through. Virgin Galactic has already established a foothold with NASA and a working relationship with the defense industry in Italy, positioning them to capture some very lucrative R&D funding and a place at the US defense-industrial complex pig trough. 

3. Space captures peoples imaginations. Trite but true. They've got a cool ticker and a shortcut to people's sense of imagination. Boomers who were kids when Neil Armstrong hopped off that ladder still have a soft spot in their hearts for that awe they felt. Any who made it big would either buy this stock out of nostalgia, or book a flight to scratch that midlife crisis and think about when they got head in their daddy's car after A New Hope blew their minds.

4. Their success will drive other companies to go public. Everyone at TSLA  and across the world just saw how crazy rich they can get off a meme stock and a dream. You think Daddy Musk is going to let that go to waste with fucking SpaceX? As soon as Branson hits that zero g on his birthday, you can bet Elon is going to be smoking a joint and thinking about taking SpaceX public at 420.69. Next thing you know it'll turn into a meme stock war in the race to 10,000 per share, and speculation will have literally funded 3 lunar bases when Bezos crashes the party late.

TTWO is down almost 5% today because the VP of Rockstar games is stepping down. He’s already been on leave for months. Seems like an overreaction to me.


Here’s why I bought Calls:

• Gta and read dead online hit record numbers of players in December. 

• both GTA and read dead online have constantly been releasing new expansions are not cheap and I bought them and I know hella people did

• The stock has been getting hit this past week so it’s at the lows for the past two weeks

• TTWO has a high rate of beating earnings and delivering surprises


Here’s a few additional bullish thoughts:

GTA online is rewarding everybody who logs in between now and Feb 13th $1,000,000 gta cash to celebrate record numbers. Seems pretty damn bullish to me. 

The Casino addition to GTA is one of the biggest money makers they added. Blackjack, poker, roulette, horse betting. I think this virtual casino can create gambling addicts who will be sucking dick for that gta virtual currency for quarters to come.

The bike itself shows a decent amount of user data, so I had the bright idea to try to back into sub numbers using the below calculations. Every number here is definite EXCEPT for my assumption for the rate of bikers signing up for the annual challenge (see below).

Based on my calculations, plus anecdotal evidence of exponentially increased activity over the past few months on the official Facebook groups and in the live rides, I believe PTON will beat expectations. HOWEVER, I also believe they are fundamentally overvalued here (I know, who cares about that in wsb land).  Therefore, I am playing this by buying calls as a pure lotto play.  I will buy shares if the price drops after lockup period expires.

IPO: 1.4M members / 511,202 subscribers = 2.74 members per sub

Q1: 1.6M members / 562,774 subscribers = 2.84 members per sub

Q2 projected : 680K-685K subs

As of today, there were 362,578 participants in the ""Annual Challenge"".  This is a challenge that not many people know about/sign up for. It's not worth much except if you are motivated by these types of things.   I believe the rate of members signing up for this challenge is about 15%.

So... 362,578 / 15% = 2,417,187 members / 2.84 members per sub = 851,122 total subs vs 680K-685K projected.  Keep in mind: 1) my calculation is as of today, not as of the end of Q2, and 2) my 15% signup rate is a pure guess based on my PTON cult knowledge. Anyone else who owns a PTON can chime in with guesses about the challenge sign up rate.

Intelsat has been part of an ongoing dispute with the FCC over selling off the C-Band to enable the spread of 5G technology. They currently have about 14 Billion in debt, which has given their side of the negotiations a bit of urgency.

The FCC was playing hardball, and apparently coordinating with Senators in order to get the lowest price possible for the auctioning of these assets, with the Senators proposing a 1 Billion total buy price, and the FCC offering 10 Billion max, with Intelsat receiving 45% of that at most.

Intelsat told them to go fuck themselves, and that they would declare chapter 11 if the FCC didnt give them more, or allow private auctioning, which could result in proceeds as high as 77 billion.

This resulted in an aftermaket agreement with the FCC, details yet to be disclosed. All anyone knows is that its settled. 

On a separate note, theres been some weird wild fluctuations on low volume traded calls for this stock, which have resulted in several high spikes in price over the past couple days. 

Puts are an option, but honestly I'd go for the dirt cheap calls as a relatively low cost bet with potentially sky high payoff.

For the virgins without tiny demons living in your household, this is your reminder that they have recently taken Magic the Gathering to a digital F2P release that has been wildly successful over the last year, and last quarter's set seems to have been the product of some back-room collaborations with Disney, featuring a [Star Destroyer, Pride Rock, and the fucking Disney Castle](http://epicstream.com/news/JakeVyper/5-Magic-The-Gathering-Extended-Art-Versions-of-5-Throne-of-Eldraine-Rare-Lands). The entire set is ""fairy-tale"" themed, and they're heavily investing in this digital product, including a [spiffy trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzBrfW7Ipzg), an [RPG](https://www.pcgamer.com/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-story-driven-rpg-studio-led-by-ex-bioware-vets/), rumors of a Netflix series, and greater [whale-monetization strategies](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/secret-lair-recap-2019-11-25). Looks like Brian Goldner has finally decided it's time to put you autists to work, and your efforts are going to lead to a top-line boon to revenues. You might think Mark Rosewater is your friend, but simmering just below his friendly smile and unadulterated love for the game is a deep-seated desire to take your money at any cost. Haven't you noticed all the ""gold"" and ""treasure"" tokens lately? You're ripe for the picking, and it's harvest time at Hasbro, baby.

For the Chads and Stacies that have managed to overcome their autism for long enough to procreate, these guys not only make all the toys for the Marvel universe, but they're doing all the Frozen toys too. 

I'd say ""enough said"" but I am still blown away by how ridiculous Frozen was for revenues last time around, so I'll recap it here. 

2013 Q4: Frozen releases November 27, 2013. Originally, Frozen toys weren't made by Hasbro, but they kept selling out, so Disney partnered with HAS to help get the gravy train flowing. 

2014 Q4: In the quarterly conference call (FEB9, 2015), Deb Thomas says

>Full-year product development expense increased to 5.2% of
revenues. Investment in our brands and in innovation is ongoing and
strategically important for Hasbro. As we previously communicated,
we began development of the Disney Princess and Frozen properties
in the fourth quarter, ahead of revenues which do not commence until
2016. As a result, as anticipated, 2014 product development expense
was above the high end of our typical product development range of
4.5% to 5.0%.

>In 2015, we anticipate product development as a percent of sales to be
in the range of 5.0% to 5.5%. This expense should return to our more
normalized range in future years as we begin to recognize revenues
associated with the Disney Princess and Frozen properties. 

2015 Q4: Feb 8 2016, in the Q4/year-end results Brian Goldner says they've started shipping on schedule:

>In 2016, Hasbro’s line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY’S FROZEN
fashion dolls and small dolls became available. These products are
already on shelves in the U.S. and rolling out internationally. We shipped
a very small amount of product in the fourth quarter given the timing of
retailer plans. Shipments are now ramping up and early consumer
indications are positive. Great partnership with Disney and our global 
retailers is resulting in a smooth transition, with product on shelf
beginning in January. We are closely monitoring inventory at retail to
ensure this continues in 2016, as revenues grow and we build greater
efficiency and profitability into this new business. 

Deb Thomas in agreement:

>To fully execute our strategy, investments in innovation are paramount
to our long-term success. Product development totaled 5.5% of
revenues. This includes the investment in our DISNEY PRINCESS
and DISNEY’S FROZEN offerings for which revenues commenced in
January in a more meaningful way. 

In the financials, Q4 Girls Revenue is 312.4 M, down 10% from the previous year, Fiscal Year 2014 Girls revenue is 1022.6 M, up 2% over the previous year.

Less notable: Magic is lackluster this year.

2016 Q1: ""Girls category revenues increased 41% to $165.4 million. The first quarter marked the on shelf date for Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN fashion and small dolls. The addition of these brands along with DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS and growth in BABY ALIVE delivered strong quarterly revenue growth for the category. The Girls category increased 48% absent the impact of foreign exchange."" Yes, 165.4 for girls is ""up 41%"" over Q1 2015's 117.1, not over Q4's 312.4, but it's still 41%.

2016 Q2: ""Girls category revenues increased 35% to $172.3 million. Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY'S FROZEN fashion and small dolls along with revenue growth in BABY ALIVE led the increase in the quarter."" This time over Q2 2015's 127.5.  The other categories hover around 5% growth over previous year, which means that Hasbro would still be a good company without Disney.

2016 Q4/year-end: ""**Girls category revenues in 2016 grew 50% to a record $1.19 billion.** The category benefited from shipments of Hasbro's line of DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN fashion and small dolls, the successful launch of DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and significant growth from BABY ALIVE. Additional revenue growth came from Hasbro brands including FURREAL FRIENDS and EASY-BAKE OVEN products."" The percentage is fuzzy, since these lying pieces of shit said that Q4 2015 girls category revenue was 258.8, not the 312.4 reported back then, and full year was 798.2, not 1022.6, but even using the old numbers it's up 26% comparing just the quarters, and 16% for the full year.

So, knowing what Frozen toys did for Hasbro, when they came to the party a year late... how will they fare when they're in it from the beginning?

Also, Nerf has been doing better than it was last year (some Fortnight related shit, idk, I'm not 12), and they've got preorders of Mandalorian toys. Someone fucked up with the [Baby Yoda](https://www.space.com/baby-yoda-hasbro-toys-coming-2020.html) toy supply chain, so I assume heads will roll over the lost profits, but better late than never. They've also bought Entertainment One, which is some movie making thing, so I guess it's time for the MTG movie or another Dungeons and Dragons movie.

Also, Hasbro has invested in mobile phone shovelware if that matters to you. Also, fucking Power Rangers are back, and that [shit rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=468GDmRsUQY). 

So how does it all go wrong?

Well, maybe this Corona Virus bullshit is going to fuck up the supply chain and that will be reflected in the forward looking statements. There's also trade war BULLSHIT that fucked up earnings earlier. Was Star Wars bad enough to ruin both Marvel and Frozen? Doubt it.

EXCEPT for revenue guidance for next quarter, which was $470-480m in revenue vs. high end expectations of $507m. Apparently their delivery logistics shaved off a couple days vs. last year, pulling forward 6,000 deliveries, or about 5% of revenue from 3Q20 into this current quarter. If they HADN'T improved their delivery times, revenue guidance would have been in line with expectations. Oh well. I suspect that the stock will go down this week and rebound into next week, as it did after last quarter's earnings release, going from $25 to $22 for a week, followed by the run-up to $37 as people realize the company is raising guidance for subs, revenue, and EBITDA. Just my $0.02. I still own $50 March 20th calls and I'm not selling at the moment. It'll take a few days for the sellers to clear out so expect a few down days. My notes from the call are below. 

Fiscal 2Q20 Metrics

Connected Fitness Subs came in at 712k, up 96% y/y and beating high end expectations of 703k

Revenue was $466m, up 77% y/y and beat high expectations of $443m

Engagement was strong with 12.6 avg monthly workouts per connected sub, up from 9.7 y/y

Avg churn of 0.74% was way below expectations of 1.00%

EBITDA of ($28.4m) was well ahead of estimates of ($55m)

Gross margin flat at 42.3% y/y

Has $1.5b of cash

Cash from operations was $33.2m

Capex was $48.8m due to buildout of new studios in NYC and London. Also purchased Tonic, their Taiwanese supplier for $46m

Fiscal 3Q20 Guidance

843-848k ending connected fitness subs, in line with estimates of 847k

$470-480m in revenue, up 50% y/y, but below estimates of $507m

($25-35m) EBITDA loss, in line with estimates of ($30m)

Churn below 0.95%, below estimates of 1.10%

Gross margin 43-44%

Full year guidance for FY2020-

Raised ending connected subs to 920-930k, essentially in-line with estimates of 921k

$1.53-1.55bn in revenue, up 68% y/y and in line with estimates of $1.54b

Gross margin of 43.5-44.5%

Adj EBITDA of ($95-115m), much better than ($140m) expected

Churn below 0.95%, better than 1.04% expected

Notes from the call

\-Churn was positively impacted by lower return rates and higher retention than expected

\-30% of classes taken were non cycling classes

\-Goal is to have more accessible products that can be sold to all demographics (cheaper products coming?)

\-Digital subscription is lead generation tool for selling more hardware. Makes sense why they dropped the price of the digital subscription. Running digital app at breakeven. 

\-Germany going as well as the UK launch did in 2018.

\-Return rates still in the low single digits.

\-Better delivery logistics means time from order to delivery was shortened by a few days, causing a pull forward of revenue from 3Q20 into this quarter. Hence the huge outperformance this qtr and guidance below expectations. The shift was 6,000 deliveries, or about 5% of revenue. 

\-They have new software updates that will help to gamify working out and create more of a social network around the leaderboard. 

\-no pressures yet from cheaper competition. People love the Peloton product, not just an exercise bike

\-Still early days in US, UK, Germany, and Canada. Focused on those markets before expanding to others.

\-Heading towards profitability earlier than we thought (2023). We view profitability as a managed outcome. We are prioritizing growth right now because we have low churn and we want as many subscribers as possible. Lots of leverage in G&A and Marketing.",2020-02-06 18:02:44

The volume of APT that is being traded, shows the public interest in ongoing epidemics. Normally the volume is about 100k shares/week. 2 weeks ago when the news of the corona outbreak broke, it was traded 26 million times. Last week the interest of the virus was even higher as the stock was traded 33 million times. This week the public interest has gone way down as the stock was only traded 11 million times.

The volume was rapidly declining this week, hitting it's lowest volume on Wednesday. Most people have stopped caring about the virus, and the media isn't reporting much about it. However, interest in the stock picked up on Thursday and even more on Friday. On Monday next week, the extended holiday offically ends in China, people are supposed to go back to work. A lot of specualtion is being made about the chinese lying about their offical numbers. This doesn't matter since niether the media or the WHO cares. However, if the Chinese are scared of going to work, because of how widespread the virus is, it will affect markets. China is the worlds manufacturing hub, if the factories are closed for too long, we're going to see product shortages severly affecting american corporations which will impact the markets. The increased interest in APT, shows that the market is concerned about supply chain issues that could begin occurring next week. This will have massive negative impact on western markets and I'm guessing were going to see a lot of bad news starting next week. I'm thinking a 5-10% drop, a mini recession. Probably good for APT aswell.

According the CNBC's latest live [blog](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/coronavirus-latest-updates.html) Norwegian Cruise Lines and Royale Carribean have banned Chinese nationals from all of their ships and Honda has suspended all operations in Wuhan through Feb. 13th.

[Shanghai is a ghost town](https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-puts-shanghai-coma-154246392.html) despite not being on mandatory lockdown. There's actually a great dark pun in this article that I caught:

> And few ***bat*** an eye any more at pausing for the ubiquitous temperature reading

And also a PSA from a China Gov't social media:

> ""You cannot disinfect yourself by standing out in the sun""

So the storm rages on and the WHO admits they know [virtually nothing](https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2020-02-06/who-coronavirus-source-severity-still-unknown) about the virus and that there is still no known cure.

> WHO officials said they don't know the source of the virus and that a treatment doesn't yet exist, despite some reports claiming otherwise. They also don't fully understand how severe it is or how it is transmitted.

But everything's fine, the Chinese Gov't has this [completely under control](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3049606/coronavirus-doctors-death-becomes-catalyst-freedom-speech)

> “The news of his [Li’s] death will be very carefully managed and downplayed as much as possible. [Chinese President Xi Jinping] would not allow it to be used like the death of Hu Yaobang was in 1989.”

Oh yes, we wouldn't want another Tienamin Square incident. So of course:

> “[Xi] will double down and see the need to tighten control even further. The last thing he will allow is for him to appear weak.”

The aforementioned Li of course being the 34 year old whistle blowing doctor who tried to warn people about the virus last month as and was [reprimanded by police](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3049489/coronavirus-outpouring-grief-and-anger-after-death-whistle) is now dead.

The stonk was trading around $42.50.  I sold them later in the day for a $1,000 profit (weak hands, yeah yeah) but pondering it more this weekend I think they and other cruise lines are in deep water this year.

Do you know anyone right now who would book a cruise?  I sure don't.   CCL has 10 billion in debt and will have ships just sitting there gathering dust and fees.

CCL pays a big fat dividend.   Seadrill paid a huge dividend when it was $30 a share (something like 7% IIRC).   Look at how far they fell.  Different industry, but it shows what happens with debt and unused boats.

It will do so again in the next week, if not the one after according to the charts and upcoming catalysts. Get in now if you don't want to miss out as I did last month!

4. They just  [opened registration](https://www.virgingalactic.com/join-us/) for commercial flights!  

Technicals

1. SPCE has been trading near the top of the last parabolic move since a couple of weeks ago. It pulled back a little and formed two new support levels. It has formed bullish patterns in multiple time frames - a bullish flag, ascending triangle, and a upward trend that hasn't been broken since the last parabolic move.
2. This stock is strong as fuck, the recent economic turmoil hasn't affected it a bit, it is still following the trend line and continues to consolidate at the top while slowly creeping up along the upward trend line while consolidating.
3. Last Friday it has just formed a higher low in the consolidation - a buy set up and it is safe to buy!
4. 25% of the stocks are shorts. When it breaks out of $20, they will get squeezed along with all the catalysts in the coming months.
5. Morgon Stanley has a target price of 60.  They say hypersonic travel  will have an $800 billion dollar total addressable market by 2040. SPCE  is at the head of the pack in developing the technology to enable  hypersonic point to point travel, so they could very well be a  disruptive force in this future industry.",2020-02-09 16:34:52

Fairly new here but with my last two tips I was able to help some people and figured I'd share some more insight so y'all don't yell at me when I post my gains on this one either ;-).

So I have been trading $SPCE aggressively since $7.20, just near its all time low of $6.90.  I have had more on my $SPCE options than I have ever played on anything else and I have done well on them.  I wanted to post some of the opinions I have come to have.  I haven't read other posts on $SPCE here so I am sure many of these have been brought up.

This may get long.  These are all the points I have personally observed and many of them have my personal opinion baked into them.  Sorry if some of the information is not the best organized, just writing some of the major points I can think of from my random scribbles on post its and memory.

I am sure I am missing a lot of points so I will keep this updated / edit it in the morning.  I am getting quite tired as I write this so will finish up any missing points when my brain is working again.  Either way, this continues to be my long-term play.  If I made any mistakes let me know and I will correct them as well.

I cautiously offer a mid-term price target inline with Morgan Stanley's bull target of $60.  I would not be surprised to see this happen in next 6-8 months but due to being cautious on an extremely speculative industry & stock, I will instead speculate we will see a move towards $60 early to mid 2021.

That being said, it is also on a huge uptrend right now and in the very short term we could see a retrace while we await stronger news.  I would enter at this point with some caution and be prepared to average down so you don't get emotional if it drops for a bit before moving back to all time highs.

# EDIT: To be clear - this is a long-term play for me.  None of my calls expire before June/July even.  Not that I can't see it going up further in the short term... just wouldn't risk a short-term expiration on it until some of the points below occur.

* **Virgin Galactic Investor/SEC Presentation -** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000114420419034053/tv524921\_ex99-2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1706946/000114420419034053/tv524921_ex99-2.htm)
* **The Spaceship Company** \- [http://thespaceshipcompany.com/](http://thespaceshipcompany.com/)

**It definitely has a major first-mover advantage on multiple fronts.**

* It is a first-mover in the commercial space industry,
* It is a first-mover as publicly traded company for the industry.
* It is a first-mover in the hypersonic industry.
* It is potentially a first-mover in the manufacturing/supplier vertical and has cleared the way to do so with its close relations with Boeing, IMO.

**Very few catalysts for a downturn in immediate future**

* Any known possibility for ""bad news"" seems unlikely before at least a few major catalysts for a move up.
   * Test Flight Crash
      * I see this as unlikely but it seems to be the ""worst case scenario"" in the short term for the long play.
      * They have already made it to space with their first vehicle so they have proven they are capable.
      * The crash that many talk about was pilot error, not due to manufacturing faults.
      * Before we can get to Test Flights, which would mostly run out of the Space Port, we need to get the space ships to the Space Port which will likely include many events from announcing the flight with fanfare and celebration to announcing a reopening of ticket sales (see below for those and more).
      * Before we get to Test Flights, we also have the event at the end of Feb where they seem likely to make major announcements leading into their earnings call.
   * Delayed initial flight w/ Branson
      * I can't imagine this will occur but it has been delayed in the past multiple times.
      * I have some added observations below which show why they seem confident in their schedule.
   * IPO from Blue Origin
      * It does appear that Blue Origin is gearing up for a move public.
      * *This could either:* greatly increase interest in Space and expand the industry across the board since only two options would exist
      * ***Or:*** This could break $SPCE's monopoly on the industry as it has today and move much interest to ""the new Amazon potential.""
      * Blue Origin is $SPCE's main and only major competitor that has been able to show a real potential at delivering on their promises.  They have recently conducted test flights, they have hired a comm director in recent days, and Bezos has been selling far more stock than usual (I believe just over $3 billion at time of writing this) to fund what seems to be a major strategic move.
      * I do think the announcement of Blue Origin IPO being imminent could be a temporary hit to $SPCE, but the effect will be **greatly muted** should $SPCE already have momentum, announced dates for their flights, re-opened ticket sales, etc.  **THIS IS CRITICAL** and my **#1 concern at this time** is that Bezos realizes this and the recent moves he is making are to try to move their schedule up and get ahead of them here.
      * If Blue Origin can ""steal the thunder"", if you will, before $SPCE is able to gain the worlds attention with reopening ticket sales and other things mentioned in the points above, this could prove pretty harmful to the gains we would otherwise see.  Although I think either way we would move up, there will be a whole different narrative if the ""but Blue Origin..."" footnote is added to every news release that would otherwise be solely focused on $SPCE.
      * Bezos is a shark and he's damn good at what he does.
      * Bezos is essentially ""all-in"" on space...
      * Needless to say, I will be investing major in Blue Origin as well...
   * IPO from SpaceX's StarLink is all but guaranteed
      * SpaceX has announced that they are almost surely going to be spinning off StarLink from SpaceX and going public with that.
      * Timeframe, however, does not seem to be in the immediate future and we will likely have a significant warning ahead of this move.
      * I've done fairly significant research on StarLink but will leave that to IPO announcement time since it is off-topic here.
      * There is not much competition of the two aside from them both being considered in the ""Space Industry.""  I do not think this will cause any kind of downturn.

**Boeing Clears the Way for The Spaceship Company?**

* Boeing has invested $20m (so far) into $SPCE.
   * Interestingly, Boeing seems to be turning its interest away from space & hypersonic and deferring to others to take up the mantle (meanwhile, ""working closely with $SPCE engineers at the Spaceship Company as allies""... hint hint?)
   * Interestingly, shortly after news of Boeing no longer pursuing some contracts that ""The Spaceship Company"" can easily target, all this news breaks about NASA and Space Force looking for private contract bids on many fronts they can easily service.
   * Whitesides (CEO) has mentioned that Boeing is a very active partner that their engineers are working with ""intimately"" to advance their technologies in a recent interview.
* Spaceship Company seems like a surefire spinoff of $SPCE in the near future?
   * Being able to provide hypersonic flight manufacturing services to others allows them to corner the market
   * As mentioned, their partnership with Boeing clearly gives them an advantage of Boeing's contacts & expertise
   * From what I can tell they have a significant lead on R&D from those we have seen show interest in the space.
* The Spaceship Company President promoted to COO of $SPCE
   * This feels like a move to allow Enrico to begin preparations for major moves and restructuring to bring about their Hypersonic flight ambitions.
* The Spaceship Company seems to have some clear potential for independently bidding on many of these new government contracts on top of the other pieces mentioned above.

**Hints to July First Flight Plan for Branson?**

* In a recent interview, Whitesides (CEO) mentioned how Branson was looking forward to going to space as it would essentially be his 70th Birthday present.
* Last year, Branson mentioned he wanted to time the flight with the Apollo 11 Anniversary which also coincides with his Birthday within a few days  (July 16 & 18 IIRC), quoted as saying ""... So yeah, July the 18th is my birthday so why not? We'll go for that."" [https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/richard-branson-eyes-apollo-11-anniversary-trip-space/story?id=61102112](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/richard-branson-eyes-apollo-11-anniversary-trip-space/story?id=61102112)
* I have seen some hints that June is a possibility as well, but either way they appear to be quite confident in their ability to hit mid-year for the first flight.

**Re-opening Ticket Sales -- raising price per ticket?**

* Whitesides has said that due to strong demand they will likely raise their ticket pricing by a significant amount.
* Tweets and Instagram posts went out about joining their newsletter.  One of the main questions in that form was how much you would pay for a ticket.
   * It would appear they are pricing out how many they can sell at various price points to see what they might be able to open ticket sales at again.
   * If I were doing the above, I would expect a couple weeks or so to generate those leads which would include various posts that seem kind of pointless of random accomplishments as an excuse to advertise those sign-ups in the meantime -- I doubt they will want to hint at their goals to generate leads as that could affect the lead quality they receive.
   * They have a conference scheduled a few days before their earnings call at the end of the month.  It seems like they will likely plan to announce their intent to re-open ticket sales and at what price then as we lead into an earnings where they are likely to post a significant loss.  Guidance of new revenue should then be the only thing in focus.
   * Personally I believe we will see tickets go on sale for $350k with perhaps some cheaper options -- not really sure here but $350k seems to feel what they will target.

**Hints at Major Celebration Event Imminent**

* Recently someone tracked Flight Aware that their first spaceship was flying to the Mojave to join its new sibling.
   * Unless it required some sort of work done, this seems like a move where they are preparing for a major event in-which they can have press photograph the two together as they make the voyage to the Space Port together.
   * Clearly they will want to make a grand spectacle to go viral on news and garner a surge of leads leading up to ticket sales re-opening.  This seems like the perfect way of doing it?
   * They have recently announced that their second space craft is nearing completion.  They are working on the internal systems at this point.
   * They have also pointed out that they have also begun work on Spaceship 3 and that they are completing them far faster and less expensive with each iteration.
* Branson recently tweeted pictures of him at the Space Port with the entire team.
   * It seems to me they were having an all-hands on-deck meeting to discuss & plan these celebrations and coordinate the team moving into what will clearly be one of the most important events of the companies history.

**Hypersonic / Point-to-Point is a Game Changer**

* Point-to-Point is a game changer which the Virgin brand will have a moat that will be hard to beat.  Combining hypersonic options with their contacts within the airline industry from Virgin Atlantic & Virgin America to offer comprehensive travel options for any travel needs.
* Ability to do a level of cross-marketing & promotion that no other player hoping to break into PTP/Hypersonic will be able to come close to.
* Many years ahead at this point and the **only** player I am aware of that will be able to go from manufacturing of the vehicles all the way to the consumer level.
   * No one will be able to touch their pricing for the foreseeable future.  This is one reason why many are calling them the ""Tesla of Space""  [https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/09/virgin-galactic-is-the-tesla-of-the-space-industry.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/09/virgin-galactic-is-the-tesla-of-the-space-industry.aspx)

**Insane Growth Opportunity**

* Some massive potential to enter industries/verticals that they have not yet indicated interest in - **pure speculation below warning.**
* Space is big - and the market opportunity for a company which is servicing every vertical which is currently practical are mind boggling.
   * As their tech evolves, being able to deliver payloads and/or people into actual orbit would increase their market potential exponentially.
   * They seem likely to approach this market as we are starting to see news of ""space hotels"" and such which would fit beautifully into their Space Tourism marketing.
   * As mentioned, they also have incredible opportunity to cross-market with other Virgin brands to achieve a level of consumer awareness that would cost competitors much more to capture.

**While not part of the $SPCE family, Virgin Orbit is worth knowing about**

I bought April 50 strikes ahead of earnings and yes, I’m disappointed to see chegg down AH today but I remain certain I will make a profit on this trade, my break even is 50.50 at expiration. Though if I had waited til after earnings to buy I could have bought more but no regrets, Yolo, this is the way.

Here’s why : 

chegg has a large amount of short shares, a whopping 16.9 percent of shares are in a short position,  the stock is getting shorted ah because chegg soared 5 percent today and is near a 52 week high, chegg also has a relatively low float, 116 million, 

Now With more solid earnings posted today and a possibly a new reasonable dip to buy after a period of massive growth, The share price will settle and consolidate hopefully around these resistance levels 42- 44, and the dip will start getting bought, as does any dip in this market right now, 

As solid as cheggs report was today, I think it’s safe to predict a massive short squeeze might be coming. With the low float and large shares short percentage, with the stock down after solid earnings, fundamentally I could see a rally that spurs a massive short squeeze taking the stock to new highs in the near future.",2020-02-11 02:59:56

LSCC (Lattice Semiconductor) is announcing earnings tomorrow and is worth your consideration as a YOLO for two reasons:  


1.) Jim Anderson, the CEO  
This fucker used to be my boss (corporate overlord, I never met him). Our company was sold to AVGO back when they were trading at $65/share and Mr. Anderson made out like a bandit on the increase in value in his shares. Then in May of 2015 he went to become a VP for A-M-Fucking-D. In case you were too young to remember what AMD's stock price was back then I'll remind you. It was $2.30. Motherfuckin' Jim stayed on until August of 2018 and then peace'd the fuck out to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor. You know what AMD's stock price was in August of 2018? Twenty-Five-Fucking Dollars. Homeboy literally worked for three goddamn years and 10x'd on AMD.  


So August of 2018 he goes to become CEO of Lattice Semiconductor when their stock price is around $7.50 and sneaky Jimbo goes and delivers a terrible earnings, tanks the price all the way down to $5 bucks so he can accumulate shares like the sly multi-millionaire fucker he is. Then the stock proceeds to fucking skyrocket up to a peak of $24 over the next 12 months.  


So that's reason number 1. Follow the money. Follow Jimbo.

STEPS FOR HOW TO DO THIS INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO EVERY COMMENT -

1. Contact your broker to determine when their cutoff date is for the transaction.
2. Buy as many shares as you want (more likely to get 100% bought back at 30-33 if you have 99 since they will fill the odd lots first if literally every share holder takes advantage of this as XBIT set their limit to 420mill worth of shares bought back in this offer, with 40.9mill shares outstanding * 22 per share currently = total market cap ~900mill, )
3. Submit for tender without bid to guarantee at least 46% (420mill/900mill) of your shares get bought back at 30-33
4. Profit and roll into meme stock calls

* In plane English:  The FTC is worried that during the last decade, FAAAM used HSR to squash competition before it could arise and take over the world.  A easy example of expansion: Amazon buying a bunch of small manufacturing companies so they suddenly have the infrastructure to produce Amazon Basics, products designed to compete with everyday needs.

THEY ARE NOT A HARDWARE COMPANY. ROKU is in the Ad business building a *big, next-generation’ targeted ad platform.*

As more and more people cut the cable, they will have to turn to ROKU's platform, or should I say 'ecosystems' to stream their favorite cable channels and networks. ROKU will take a % of this and be one of the largest in America, since anyone, anywhere with an internet connection can use roku to stream TV. The primary competitor is not other services on the platform, the primary competitor is linear tv - and ROKU has them beat.

**Let's look at some numbers:**

* Roku sells more dedicated streaming devices than perhaps any other company in the world. It’s been estimated that there are more Rokus in US households than there are Fire TVs, Chromecasts, or Apple TVs. Estimates say 40% of all TV's sold are Roku TV's. 
* If you read through [ROKUs dev SDK](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/advertising/roku-advertising-framework.md), you'll see they force their channel partners to use *their* ads taking a cut of all profits and subs made by, FOX, Disney+ etc.
   * *Entertainment firms pay a carriage fee to be on the cable lineup.* Roku has built itself up as an advertising company, getting a cut of the ad revenues from major media partners in exchange for the distribution. 
   * **Roku's 2019 revenues**, **67% of Roku's $1.1 billion in revenues came from ads**. Growing to $1.6 billion in 2020, with the bulk coming from advertising again. Which amounts to the revenue base more than doubling (111% projected growth rate between 2018-2020.
* ROKU's CEO went into a [Mexican standoff with FOX](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/4623654002) and fucking wonn. The guy has balls, ROKU got the superbowl and cucked FOX.

**Guidance:**

* Millions more to cut their 'cable' in 2020 and pick it back up on ROKU enabled devices and TV's
* ROKU will announce (soon) something with COMCAST 
* 1/2 of Disney subs signed up using Roku 
* Super Bowl

Inverse me cause I'm totally off my rocker and my day job has nothing to do with stonks or trading. You've been warned.  


AMD having recently broken resistance at 50 is looking to scale even greater heights. Its lining up a very strong run-up for 2020, having ripped market share from Intel in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.  


Breaking down into points for all the illiterate:  


**POINT 1: APPLE CURRENTLY TESTING AMD CHIPS IN MACBOOK PROs**  

Developers have found snippets of code suggesting that Apple developers were testing AMD chips within the kits. [AMD new chips are almost exactly the multi-core solution](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/why-apple-should-ditch-intel-for-amd/) apple need and If this pans out they may replace Intel in the near future

This leads us nicely into the next point...

**POINT 2: APPLE WANTS TO DITCH INTEL**  

Intel has famously suffered from shortages leading to Apple blaming them in slumps in sale in [May 2019](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/apple-blames-intels-processor-shortage-for-slump-in-mac-sales). They still can't get their shit together and [cant even confirm  if they can meet 2020 production.](https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/intels-cpu-shortage-impact-chip-giants-pc-makers/).  
They even wrote an [apology letter.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-sorry-for-pc-chip-delays-but-we-just-cant-meet-demand-for-cpus/) Apple are looking to jump ship and AMD are starting to look like a luxury yacht. [Expect a JUNE 3rd Announcement at Apples Developers conference](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/apple-may-start-selling-macs-with-amd-cpus)

**POINT 3: AMDs THREADRIPPERS ARE SETTING WORLD RECORDS**  

Overclockers are using [threadrippers to clock in 5,548.71MHz.](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3990x-overclocked-at-55-ghz-is-setting-world-records) This is a day after release, with overclockers till continuing to tweak and optimize their rigs. Expect top tier sales from this bad boy from PC geeks worldwide

**POINT 4: AMDs are in BOTH the PS5 and in the XBOX Series X**   

Both console giants are will be utilizing [AMD processors in their consoles](https://www.techradar.com/sg/news/could-amd-smartshift-be-the-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-secret-sauce-for-8k-gaming). What else do I have to explain? Its videogames everyone and their uncle is gonna have one.  


**POINT 5: AMD WILL STILL BE RELEASING COMPETITIVE GPUS (BIG NAVI) AND CPUS (ZEN3)**

Rumors of a GPU releasing March 3 (supposedly an RTX2080 TI Killer) have been circulating, we may not see this date but [Su BAE herself has confirmed a 2020 release](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/70025/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-confirms-see-big-navi-2020/index.html).  
[ZEN 3 Architecture was also confirmed by Queen Su](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-zen-3) and will upgrade the company's mobile offering substantially.

END OF POINTS  


Based on all the above, I believe AMD will see tremendous progress as a company and in its stock price. If it can survive any negative corrections, we may never see these prices again. If you want to YOLO on *actual* company doing disruptive things in its industry this is it.

Historically, they could be viewed as contrasting financial products. Jump into the safety of treasuries when shit hits the fan. Jump into stonks when shit does not hit the fan. For the savants - the good old risk-parity trade. 

This logic since the financial crisis has been negligent, as due to Fed policy (including ZIRP and QE) rates have been artificially held low. We know this. Cool.

Now when you do an overlay comparison between the 10Y Treasury and SPY for the past decade, a significant plunge in rates preceded every significant SPY pullback with the exception of the Vol explosion in Feb 2018. 

However, on a 20 year (weekly) comparison, since the Vol explosion and trade war related volatility in Feb 2018, rates and stonks have been on the most significant divergence of the past decade.

Moreso, on a 5 year (daily) comparison of the 10 Year Treasury and SPY, since late May / early June 2019 when Fed talk of rate cuts really escalated, the divergence in the relationship has been the strongest. 

**What does this mean?**

Treasuries are having record inflows (in part due to Fed policy, foreign sovereign debt yields at negative yields, corona, etc.) while simultaneously stonks are hitting all time highs. Historically, such significant divergences are followed by mean reversion (in this case a short term return to a relatively symmetric relationship). The question becomes, which side is right and which is wrong? 

Is the bond market reasonably pricing in fear or are stonks worthy of all time highs?

**tl:dr: Bond market and stock market are sending different signals. Bond market showing fear, stonk market showing optimism. Is this the final crusade for the bears to officially rise up?**

If she does not, the Defense Department has said **it plans to issue the first “substantive” JEDI task order to Microsoft on Friday.""**

[Source](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/aws-seeks-trump-testimony-in-jedi-cloud-lawsuit/)

If all goes accordingly, headlines will read AWS defeated by Azure. Refocusing attention on Microsoft's profitable and growing cloud business. Not to mention, this is a 10 year deal with openings to new government cloud deals.

***Why is this a big deal?***

From my personal experience in the cloud business, I've worked directly with one of Amazon's subsidiaries on large cloud deals (over 7-figures) in Asia & South America for streaming services that needed low-latency that AWS could not provide due to their datacenter locations. It took our company over 7 months through litigation, red-lines, etc to finalize a contract. One the contract was finished and approved, getting new business can be done in the same day, i.e., once Microsoft is awarded, they can continue growing their government deals as needed, in the same day.

Thus, tomorrow's ruling is a big win (if it happens) for Microsoft.

Update: [the author just posted a new article](https://federalnewsnetwork.com/defense-main/2020/02/as-key-jedi-court-decision-looms-pentagon-warns-of-national-security-concerns/)

A few key takeaways:

1. ""...the government argued not only that Amazon lacks the necessarily legal basis to get the temporary stop-work order, issuing one would cause **concrete harm to national security**.""

*Favors MSFT*

2) ""...To win the injunction, among other factors, Amazon needs to show that it’s likely to win the underlying lawsuit and that it its interests would suffer more without a work stoppage than the government’s would if the JEDI buildout was paused.""

*Favors MSFT*

3) “While still lacking several key features of the JEDI Cloud…\[DoD\] anticipates a  financial  harm of between $5 and $7 million dollars every month that performance of the JEDI contract is delayed.”

*Nail in the coffin. Case dismissed. MSFT, flawless victory.*

This experience will rely on 5G. The Xbox Series X may play a big role in this because of the following:

>Edge computing will be a key enabler for 5G to deliver on its bandwidth and latency requirements

>[https://www.thefastmode.com/expert-opinion/16410-5g-needs-edge-computing-to-deliver-on-its-promises](https://www.thefastmode.com/expert-opinion/16410-5g-needs-edge-computing-to-deliver-on-its-promises)

What if the weird shape of the Xbox Series X is due to built-in 5G antennas?

To back this speculation up, Microsoft says it’s planning ‘bold’ moves to make you pick the Xbox Series X over Sony’s PS5: [https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/](https://bgr.com/2020/02/11/xbox-series-x-vs-ps5-microsoft-has-bold-launch-plans-for-new-xbox/)

Part of this bold move will assuredly be coupling the Xbox Series X with the xCloud, which is Microsofts cloud-based gaming service and it runs off of Microsoft’s Azure data centers. [https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/testing-microsofts-project-xcloud-new-streaming-service-feels-like-magic-trick/)

The Xbox will probably exist as the GPU edgenode for gaming but also a 5G node because the bigger picture above gaming applciations is delivering the software and infrastructure for 5G data distribution. This is Azures purpose.

**Azure and 5G**

Microsoft has been hard at work setting themselves up for this. Remember the JEDI contract?

Well what if JEDI is only the tip of the iceberg? Who cares about one $10B contract with the Department of Defense when 5G-serving wireless carriers are paying you for organizing 5G data distribution?

>Microsoft, Dell, and others are not developing 5G infrastructure hardware. Instead, they are developing a common engineering standard that would allow 5G software developers to run code atop machines that come from nearly any 5G hardware manufacturer. They are developing software and cloud capabilities that will replace a lot of the 5G equipment which is supplied by Huawei.

Take a look at what happened to Microsoft's share price after 10/26/2019. That was the JEDI contract boom. The share price trend following that date isn't going away any time soon.

I came across the fact that Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia produce over 70% of natural rubber in the world. As well, at least Thailand and Malaysia have started to see the beginnings of outbreak worries & sickness confirmations, which would absolutely wreck them considering their shitty healthcare infrastructure, and thus wreck the material supply for 70% of the world's rubber.

Goodyear Tire hosted their earnings call a couple of days ago, and stated that,  “is not clear what the full impact of the Coronavirus disruption will be,"" when it comes to guiding future quarters.  They have a plant in China, the Goodyear-Pulandia plant. It’s located in the Liaoning province, which is a critical port/shipping spot for China. The plant has been closed for 9 days, soft opened on the 10th, and employees will be “working remote” until the 17th. 

Clearly their inventory will be fucked due to no hands being on deck for half a month (1/6 of a fucking quarter), but that may not be the only worry here...

If the port traffic is down & they aren't receiving raw rubber from the local SE Asian sources due to ***their*** production issues, then things will get much worse from there. China is responsible for 14% of sales & 21% of their operating income as of Jan 2019, & that has only scaled since then. 

The rubber sourcing issue is what I believe was referred to when stated that Coronavirus outlook was, ""not clear."" 

***Nearer to the next quarter's earnings, I would consider shorting $GT, and flipping long whenever you feel that the impacts of all of the above have been measured.***

You might've read my post yesterday prior to today's court ruling. For those that have short-term calls, sorry for your lost tendies. For those that are holding past March, stay strong -- tendies will be crispy. 

Here's my rational from past ER:

* Windows OEM revenue up 18%. 
* MSFT Divided date: 02/19/20

I expect Heather Bellini, analyst at Goldman Sachs, to raise PT for Microsoft very soon. Here's [her take on FastMoney yesterday](https://youtu.be/YxhlZ0EQANU?t=72) stating she's not only bullish short-term, but long-term as well.

Last, but not least, (sighs) the JEDI contract is **still awarded** to Microsoft (fuck you Jeff).

Next steps:

1) *""Amazon must submit a plan for offering the money to the court by next Thursday, and it must agree to redactions to the judge’s order no later than Feb. 27 so that it can be made public.""*

528,DD,How much is SPCE actually worth?,-0.9994,f3l9po,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f3l9po/how_much_is_spce_actually_worth/,57,1581675616.0,"Fellow Autists, here's my garden shed valuation exercise for SPCE. Obviously just my opinion and I could potentially be wrong... lol.  

So what is SPCE? To call it a space company is a vast exaggeration, really it's a company with currently one (eventually three) plastic planes it shoots up about 300k ft into the lower reaches of the Themosphere just past the Karman line, all on a parabolic trajectory so the up to six passengers on board get the illusion of weightlessness for a bit. That's it. It's a luxury *vomit comet* with some fancy marketing. When Morgan Stanley looked at this they supposedly valued this part of the business at 10 bucks for the target price, assuming it's fully operating. If Virgin Galactic were ever to pull off a multi billion dollar development and certification program to develop and bring to market a hyper-sonic point to point transport system, then (probably won't be made from plastic) reportedly, to Morgan Stanley that's worth another 12 bucks... bringing the total value to the well-known 22 dollars per share number. Well what do they know?

Here's my own valuation. Since proper data for SPCE is a bit thin on the ground and it's still loss making lets value operating income (OI). It’s a proxy for operating cash flow ignoring depreciation and taxes, so that's good enough for me for a top line play. We then compare it to a range of other businesses.  

Two real space business: BA (they also build rockets and satellites - incl. software bugs) - I removed the “unusual expense” charge (7,568 mil) related to the MAX debacle, AJRD - they work for NASA and DOJ and have the word “rocket” in thier name, they also do some real estate (why?) but we’ll pretend they don’t. And one cruise company NCLH - (because really whether you go out to sea and return to the same port or get shot up in the air and land at the same port... both are tour operators). NCLH b/c of size and share float, although multiples for RCL, CCL and NCLH are all pretty similar. For NCLH and AJRD used 2018 OI but looking at last 4 quarters it's likely gonna be close to that in 2019. Was gonna include an airline too but most their valuation multiples are even shittier... so cruise lines are the more favorable comp. For SPCE I also favorably assumed that their projected revenue number for 2020 of 31 mil is actually OI. Just to inflate things a bit.

The table below shows the results.  

So that means, even if we apply BA with all its current disasters as the nearest comp, SPCE is still > four times as expensive related to its OI… or at the current price would need to post OI > 130 mil to justify a valuation comparable to BA’s. IF we say our plastic plane/glider company is probably more like a cruise line then it completely falls apart. As you look at the required revenue to justify the current price in the 2020 column keep in mind that Virgin themselves claim 31 Mil are the target for 2020. Don't know whether they mean top line or OI - so let's be charitable and make it OI. They are shooting for 16 flights. 6 pax per flight (at $250k per pax) makes 96 ""guests"", so lets call it 25 Mil revenue from operations. Where the other 6 Mil will come from, who knows? Currently they only have one plane, second one crashed a while back, but another one will start testing this year. Lastly remember even though they got 600 reservations or 80 mil in refundable deposits (read that some place)... under USGAAP accounting those are NOT revenue but liabilities.... I have no doubt SPCE has the potential to become an interesting business but right now we are getting ahead of ourselves with its valuation..  

My conclusion is that in the short run people will of course overpay for jam tomorrow, just as Saint Elon has conditioned us to do, but in the long run SPCE will come back to earth if the numbers keep lacking... so I am going short for now. If I plug the 31 mil OI projection into the “model” I get a target price of $5.50 with BA as a comp. Willing to add $1.50 for hype. So price target is $7.00 - under weight. :P

TL;DR - SPCE is totally overvalued and my cherry picked numbers prove it. Shrug.

**Note:** The date posted is a mistake - it was posted about 5 minutes before this post was.

So this is a fairly major milestone but a lot to go before we make REAL progress.  Quite a few tests which will be done in quick succession and nothing can go wrong there or we going to hurt.  This will hopefully get some syndication from the normies who are all impressed with the word space and commercial.

Not yet convinced how much this will move the stock immediately with the tremendous run-up we have had in recent days -- but it could.  At this point I think the real price moving catalysts would be opening of ticket sales and announcing the date for the first flight.

What do you guys think?  Will this have a positive effect on price or will it be a non-mover?

This supports my DD in the post linked below, however where I said this would be the next step we would see happen and discuss in a bit more detail what I think we can expect.

Virgin have 3/5 of the float still and aren't disposing of any more of their shares while PE is simultaneously trying to grab a stake in it. They're driving the market cap based on the perceived value of Virgin Galactic's tech not the fundamentals. 

It's not going down because close to nobody is fucking selling the thing. You can't even short the underlying because it's flat out impossible to borrow it. There's probably more rally to come as each PE tries to take as much of a stake in it as they can. So fucking quit it with SPCE being memes. PE guys think its worth something and they're putting their money where their mouths are.

Edit: The IV of SPCE options is >100% so calls are really fucking overpriced.

Step 3. Figure out what the fuck they do. 

* These shits are REITs, meaning they make a fuck ton of money renting shit out and they pay a fuck ton of money to boomers.

Step 4. Model that shit out.

* Build one of those fancy things or be an autist and call up a researcher
* Get valuation. Fair Value is 290.

Step 5. Google Search trends. People rent this shit by searching for it. More searches = more interest. You think dumbass analyst gonna know next quarter EPS? Bitch, google gonna know.

Step 6. Realize trends are up way fucking higher than these analysts think and their balance sheet is clean.

Step 7. Realize Renaissance Technologies is invested and no matter what due diligence you do, they always fucking right. Plus they bought more (13F came out this morning). We about to be rich. The god of investing in titties bought more shares recently. My ass puts them knowing more about what's going on then my retarded brain does.

Also, Life Storage, which legit full of idiots, who the fuck gonna go to their friends and be like ""Ya I store my grandma's ashes at Life Storage.""

Well, the results of the tender offer were released: 41 million shares were tendered (offered up for sale) and 14 million were purchased. For those that can’t do math, that’s 14 million purchased at the lowest possible price in the auction. Here’s your insider info: anyone who tendered their shares can’t exit their positions until the clearing agency releases the tendered but not sold shares.  That means 27 million shares will be released to shareholders in about 2 weeks. $XBIT already dropped over 30% from the tender; it has a lot more to go.

Here's why the fuck you should care.

In the year prior to the buyout proposal, $TERP went up over 26%. Since the proposal was announced, $TERP has increased over 30% in just over one month, and has been growing about 1.15% each day since January 28th. If $TERP continues to grow at this rate, and it will, it will be worth $26.26 on March 20th. If you buy $22.5 calls for March 20th today, your return on March 20th will be 1800%. See chart below.

https://imgur.com/a/l2mT24T

Notice the red horizontal line. The only reason $TERP will not continue to rise is due to its earnings report coming out TUESDAY. This company's earnings are consistently shit, but luckily for us, that doesn't mean shit. The most drastic effect a poor earnings report has had on the company in YEARS has been a -8.45% price drop. Worst case Ontario, the report will affect the price this poorly and drop the price on expiry to $23.99, which still results in a 650% return.

tldr: You would have to be a retard to not long $Terp 3/20 $22.5 calls.

Although it is undervalued, there is not enough sentiment to move this up.    

But at the moment, France and Italy are in the push to deploy Nokia Airscale radio access for 5g & 4g/LTE.    

Huawei is now getting annexed and NOK will be filling some of the gaps.

I've lost with NOK in the past due to timing, but I think now we are on the edge of opportunity, I estimate about 2-4 Weeks until NOK starts to get coverage and moves out of its stagnation and into upward momentum.    

I am in because calls are cheap, stock is cheap, and potential future looks promising.

Open interest on Jan 21 2022 , $5 C is 57649. Current premium is $0.62    

My plan for myself and others is obtaining more calls at $5, and obtaining shares.

If you believe otherwise please comment why, I really need counter statements to why I am wrong, this will essentially kill my confidence and allow me to trade a bit safer with less YOLOs.

But I feel I am right about this one again, I have been receiving daily vaccinations and have a healthy diet of adderall and beets.

Even if I am completely wrong, collectively we can be right.

After some review though, I'm actually thinking that buying calls is the better play for 2020.  I know you're thinking it's retarded, and it probably is, but hear me out.

Thesis:

* Selling has been over-done as it is now trading below book value.  Book value per share \~$9 and market cap is under $300M for a company that made over $7B in revenue over the past 12 months.  Granted, their current business model is dying but bankruptcy doesn't seem likely in the near-term,  like many investors seem to be banking on, especially with the PS5 and Xbox2 consoles being released later this year.  Also, see next bullet.

&#x200B;

* Though Moody's downgraded their debt in January, they upgraded their outlook from negative to stable, citing their good liquidity profile among other things ([Source](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-GameStops-CFR-to-B2--PR_417805?WT.mc_id=AM%7eWWFob29fRmluYW5jZV9TQl9SYXRpbmcgTmV3c19BbGxfRW5n%7e20200130_PR_417805&yptr=yahoo)).   The fact of the matter is, the company is still relatively stable from a balance sheet perspective.  They still have an opportunity to right the ship if they play their cards right and switch up their business model as they say they are.

&#x200B;

* Short interest over 100%.  High potential for short squeeze.  It would just take one piece of positive news.  For example, if they were to close the poor performing stores, they could report a better than expected same-store sales next earnings.  Don't believe me?  The dumpster fire company Sears' reported increased same-store sales in their 2018 Q3 earnings ([Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/shoppers-return-to-liquidating-sears-stores-boost-same-store-sales.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain)), which sent the stock price up like 20% if I remember correctly due to the short squeeze.  It was a slightly misleading stat as the company was still destined for bankruptcy at that point, but it was enough for investors to find hope.

&#x200B;

* The company's near-term future is dependent largely on the upcoming PS5 and Xbox2 releases.   
 The company is expecting sales to increase significantly with their releases and I don't think that is priced in yet mostly because neither console has an official release date set yet.  At the moment, both have been confirmed by Sony and Microsoft to be released in time for the holiday 2020 season.  If either company announces an official release date, that should give investors more confidence in GameStops' future sales/earnings and potentially leading to a short squeeze.
   * Supposedly, Sony is said to have an event in March, with press invites potentially going out in late February, that could be when they provide more details and dates ([Source](https://bgr.com/2020/02/04/ps5-release-date-announcement-event-scheduled-for-march/)).

I'm thinking June/July 2020 $4.5 or $5 calls to allow time for news to come out.  I'm not really interested in GameStop long term, but I think it's under-valued at the moment.  Thoughts?",2020-02-18 04:57:42

They recently reported earnings, close to 30% revenue, earning and subscriber growth, plus raised forward guidance and yet the stock is trading 10% lower then before earnings. Now that IV crush is out of the way and the irrational earnings move is through, i dont see why calls a few months out shouldnt print. Heavily shorted too for god knows what reason when they have a healthy balance sheet, no advertising costs and insane consistent growth. Theyve beat the last 3 earnings ive followed, and im sure more before then, and raised guidance the last 2 times. Its been trading more or less flat for the last year as theyve been growing meaning the valuation has gotten a lot cheaper for all of the 3 people on wsb that care about valuations. They have a 86% of revenues coming from services which they make 80% gross margins on and a 70%+ gross margin overall even counting the physical textbook business which is also going more online too so margins should be getting better there as well. With record number of students in college wasting their money on english degrees, and a low monthly payment of 15 bucks a month. I dont see any student cancelling their subscription they probably dont pay for when it helps get them degrees which can run for hundreds of thousands of dollars. They also deliver you textbooks for cheaper and give you access online to a lot of them which should actually save most students money. They havent even tried expanding internationally past some English speaking countries (Canada, england and australia). Relatively small market cap of under 5b so wsb could actually have an underlying impact if we get it trending. Discloser i own shares, have gotten calls in the past and will likely buy some calls this week. 4/17 or 7/17 $45 is what im looking at. IV is pretty reasonable with RH saying its mod 30s.

Edit: should probably mention their service is  subcription based for all their homework help which is incredibly popular to a lot of students on campuses. For any of you in college you will know what i mean",2020-02-17 21:57:23

582,DD,DD: Predicting a Stock Leap,0.9993,f62ru8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f62ru8/dd_predicting_a_stock_leap/,40,1582104349.0,"I wanted to share my thoughts on why I think we've been seeing these recent huge gains and a possible way to capitalize on them.

**The Motivation**
 
I too am trying to become a rich fellow autist, just like you. Usually, I'm late to the meme stock party and miss out on profits. So, I thought to myself ""If I can think of the similarities between these companies, maybe I can beat the crowd and make some real r/wsb front page worthy shit.""^^hopefully ^^as ^^gains
  
**The Baseline Stock**

As my first stock of analysis, of course, I took the latest meme stock $SPCE, Virgin Galactic. Founder Richard Branson is a multi-billionaire with the proper financial backings to make a company huge. But, I figured that is not enough drive for even the newest of new investors to buy calls/shares in the masses and the stock price to soar. With a quick background check, you could find that Branson tried sending tourists to space back in 2008. [\[ref\]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7529978.stm) He even said he had over 250 people prepaid for $200,000 each. If that happened today, the stock would have probably rocketed to another dimension. 
  
Even better, the market $SPCE is entering isn't controlled by a single company, leaving room for huge growth and a market with gigantic potential. Fox already reported this hype that the space market is projected to reach upwards of $1 trillion. This was even before Virgin Galactic took off in December, albeit this market cap projection included weather, Wi-Fi, shipping and logistics, television and radio rely on satellite-based services. [\[ref\]](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/space-trillion-dollar-economy) This could be a factor.
  
**Past Trends Analysis**

It seems, especially nowadays, *hype* drives certain stocks through the roof. Even the slight thought of a company having a massive market cap leads to a huge response from investors. No news becomes good news for the company and good news creates huge share volumes. Most recently, $SPCE and $TSLA bulled their way to daily gains at unimaginable rates without much concrete news. Some meme stocks mentioned here do well ($AMD, $MSFT), those <10% daily gains have some premise, having solid financials to back it up. But, they do not demonstrate extreme leaps like $SPCE who hasn't even made a penny (since I'm Canadian, I should say a Nickel instead). To strengthen my original reasoning, I needed to think of other stocks that had this situation. Then, it all started to come together...

* $SPCE - Sub-orbital tourism/travel. [+320% in 2 1/2 months](https://imgur.com/a/2ODk0X7)
* $TSLA - The BEV vehicle with a bonus of technology and renewable energy market? Close enough of a guess, but who cares because it went [+270% in 4 months](https://imgur.com/a/RMhHzCa)
* $ACB^^RIP - Legal weed hype. Canada legalizing marijuana. [+376% in just over 2 months](https://imgur.com/a/gBILaZd)
* $BYND - Vegetarian ""meat"" market. Blew up [+255% in merely 2 1/2 months](https://imgur.com/a/dit7tmY)
* $NFLX - Online mass video streaming market. [+114% in 6 months] (https://imgur.com/a/gkhjCLT)  
* Though this is not a stock, Bitcoin investments when it was seemingly the first kind of major form of cryptocurrency was insane. [+2,390% in 1 year.](https://imgur.com/a/7yU03hK) I'd call this an outlier but I don't know anything about the market so maybe another will happen. 

This is a list of stocks I can think of, irrelevant of their revenue, that showed the best of best short term gains and all had that similarity. 

**Ahead of the Party**

If I want to get ahead of these parties I need to pick the $BYND or the $SPCE @ $8 before it runs up a 89.9° incline. Finding a company that has the potential to completely enter and control a market, without any actual revenue history. That's where this prediction comes in: $DEAC. 
  
*The market:* Major sports betting on the US market is not yet available and this acquisition corporation plans to change that by merging with DraftKings. [\[ref\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-23/draftkings-is-going-public-in-deal-valuing-firm-at-3-3-billion) Before this merger was made public, CNBC wrote a huge article on the sports betting, including a market projection of $150 billion (the estimated current illegal gambling market size). DraftKings and FanDuel own 83% of the legal gambling market in New Jersey. [\[ref\]] (https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/27/fanduel-draftkings-race-to-win-150-billion-sports-betting-market.html) This leads to a massive potential upside in having an IPO in the sports betting industry, projected to be $5 billion dollars. 

*The opportunity:* $DEAC is an acquisition corporation meant exactly for this purpose. They plan to merge with DraftKings and change to a publicly-traded DraftKings. Not only is the market projected to be large, but this deal is also said to be priced in at a market cap of $3.3 billion. By the way, $DEAC is currently at an $840 million market cap. Now... I'm no mathematician, but those numbers are definitely far apart.

*The challenge:* While a supreme court ruling allowed any state their own legalization ability for sports betting, I believe NYC just turned down daily sports fantasy betting again. It most likely will be appealed but state legalization it is something to keep in mind. Currently, it shows 21 states have DFS regulations. [\[ref\]](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/daily-fantasy-sports-blocked-allowed-states/) Tax incentives could be a push for the other states to follow and legalize DFS regulations.
  
**Conclusion/TLDR**

There's one thing in common with these huge gaining stonks, *They are breaking through to a market that's yet to be controlled*. I'm not a millionaire yet, nor I may never be, but the potential upside of a $DEAC investment seems like a great way to make people millionaires, *cough cough* calls.

HSBC is planning to lay off 35,000 staff.

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.ft.com/content/c0095f40-5203-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f

Basically they cite Winnie the Flu and the riots in HK as cutting into their profits, soooo they’re gonna fire 35k people. 

Now I’ll be honest with you, I’m kind of retarded, so don’t listen to me. But I remember watching this guy who actually made money trading on the news, and he said to short Deutsche Bank because “banks can’t shrink themselves to profitability”, or something like that. Look it up, it was a meme. Anyways, it seems to me that this is what HSBC is trying to do, shrink themselves to profitability. Idk why that it doesn’t work for banks, but there is that smart guy who says so. For what it’s worth, look at DB’s stock over the last few years, it tanked 

My second but if DD is the fact that coronavirus and the HK riots have been relatively recent, 2019 only, and so you wouldn’t think that they are going to affect HSBC so bad that they have to lay off nearly 10% of their work force. 

What makes this especially surprising in HSBC are HQ’d in Asia, and that’s where the flu n riots n shit is going on, but these job loses are going to be focused in Europe and America, not where the world’s economy has been hit hardest.",2020-02-19 03:42:15

My bearish sentiment on this stock is that the restaurants under this banner are intrinsically tied to shopping malls (many anchored by Macy's stores which will be closing) which are getting destroyed by online retail.

I spent a lot of time doing this research last night and wanted to share it all with you since I don't even think most of the market has noticed it.
  
TGI Fridays went public in 1983 but then was taken private in 1989.  The company was bought out by TriStar Capital last year.
  
TGI is merging with a SPAC, ticker ALGR.
  
ALGR has warrants - the warrant exercise price is $11.50.  The current share price of ALGR is $10.24.  We can see that it wouldn't be difficult for it to get to the $11.50 price.  Well, the warrants are .23 cents, currently.
  
**The ticker for the warrant is ALGRW**
  
I've done a lot of DD on this.  Here's some press articles I found that are worth reading:
  
https://www.fsrmagazine.com/chain-restaurants/tgi-fridays-go-public-after-380m-deal
  
http://archive.is/A9l82
  
^ The company is redoing all of it's bars in hopes of drawing in more customers.  TGI does $2B in franchise sales per year.  This current deal values the company at just $380M, which prices it at 1/4 it's yearly revenue from franchise fees.
  
ALGR extended the shareholder meeting to March 31st, 2020 to allow 'further time to consummate the deal.""

My thought is that once the merger is completed, this is going to be hyped up on CNBC, much like SPCE has been.  I was in the SPCE warrants at $2.  Sadly, I sold them at $4.
  
I don't see much risk here.  The warrants don't expire for 5 YEARS.

**Stock: DISH Networks (DISH)**

**Direction:** **Neutral Bearish**

**Price Target:** **40$**

**Type:** Call Credit Spread

**Fundamental:** Dish is currently in transition to a wireless play from their traditional hardware cable business. While its current in a downtrend, long term debt is high compared to cash on hand. In addition, DISH requires a massive 10-15 Billion worth of cash to complete its 5G dreams. While they can generate funding through banks and potential partnerships with large tech companies, it is still a very uphill battle.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving average, with visible lower volume since last earnings; a spike in volume during the Sprint + Tmobile merger announcement. MACD shows bearish divergence. RSI shows around 75, overbought. Options sentiments are very bearish in volume and bearish in open interest. Implied movement of about 8.9% or 3.61$.

**Sentimental**: Dish has been on a decline due to the rising popularity of streaming. However, with the merger of Sprint and TMUS, Dish is positioning themselves to become a 5G leader with their telecom towers and proposed new investments. This can optically revitalize the company’s image, but the logistics and capital requirements are very high and not clear enough.

**ROI: 23%**

**Risk Level: 3 out of 5, Risky**

**Sell: 2/28 44$ Call, Buy 2/28 45$ Call**  
The crux of this play is based on technical and option volume/OI sentiments. Due to the recent optimism surrounding Dish's upcoming role in the telecom space, especially due to their spectrum assets, DISH stock has jumped to the 40$ range. However, short term realities will weigh heavily on DISH in this transition period and will require DISH to show process in its ambitious 5G plans.

The wildcard would be additional updates on progress of their 5G transition. This would have a bullish and unpredictable affect on the stock price.",2020-02-18 21:23:27

From the media to analysts to WSB posters, everyone loves to compare this coronavirus outbreak to SARS and say that the economy recovered quickly last time, so it will do the same this time. A lot has been discussed about the supply chain disruptions in [other reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f07zut/some_specific_details_about_impending_supply/), so I do not think it is necessary to talk about that. The differences between the diseases themselves as well as a potential pandemic breaking out has been discussed at length too, so I don’t find it necessary to go into that either. What I will do is show how the Chinese economy is much weaker and much different now than when SARS hit in 2003 and focus not too much on the supply side, but mostly on the demand side and the banking industry based on the research I have been doing. I believe that even if factories reopen tomorrow at 100% efficiency (they have been struggling to reopen amidst [labor shortages](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/china-coronavirus-its-still-far-from-business-as-usual.html)), coronavirus is completely eradicated, and everyone starts consuming at the same levels that they would have otherwise, the Chinese economy (and the world economy with it) is still in significant trouble.

China today is much different than China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, [here are some graphs that show just how different](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/05/coronavirus-how-china-economy-has-changed-since-sars.html). Notice how China was a much smaller share of the world economy back then (just above 4% according to this graph) compared to 16% now. Services and consumption make up a much larger part of the Chinese economy now, going from a little over 40% back then to around 52% now. According to [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/Coronavirus-costs-China-service-sector-144bn-in-1-week) source, that service industry was hit with a $144b loss in a week from coronavirus. SARS was estimated to do [$33 billion in damage to the world economy](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health/u-s-and-others-tighten-curbs-on-travel-to-china-virus-toll-hits-213-idUSKBN1ZT374), coronavirus did an estimated 330% more damage (not adjusted for inflation) just to the Chinese service industry (and I think that is an underestimate) in one week. China also accounts for over 12% of global exports now as opposed to a little over 6% back in 2003. China also accounts for [one-third of global GDP growth](https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/07/25/na072618-chinas-economic-outlook-in-six-charts).

Chinese tourism has boomed since 2003 too. Tourism to Hong Kong has dropped off sharply thanks to the protests as well as coronavirus, [going from 200,000 visitors per day in February 2019 to less than 3,000 now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ358ruWsAA8AZb?format=jpg&name=medium). Most flights to/from America (and other countries) are cancelled through the end of [March or April](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/14/world/14reuters-china-health-airlines-factbox.html). SARS hit a manufacturing based economy growing at a 12% rate and that was only 4% of the world economy. This is a service based economy growing at 6% (if you believe the real numbers) that is 16% of the world economy. You can't make up the tourism or services revenue like you can with manufacturing. 750m people [according to the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/business/china-coronavirus-lockdown.amp.html#click=https://t.co/ZuO31QVi6g) are currently under some form of lockdown. Even if these quarantines lift soon (that’s a major question), the massive tourism industry both to and from China has taken a huge hit for the near future that cannot be recovered.

In December 2019, a Moody’s analyst called Chinese corporate debt the [biggest threat to the global economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/17/chinas-corporate-debt-is-biggest-threat-to-global-economy-moodys.html). [4.9% of China’s private issuers defaulted on loans in 2019](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-markets-default/chinas-private-firms-face-record-default-risk-to-stay-high-in-2020-fitch-idUKL4N28K1YM). This number is up from 0.6% in 2014. Banks have been [encouraged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-gdp-breakingviews/breakingviews-chinas-shadow-bankers-sneak-back-to-market-idUSKBN1ZG0D5) to give loans to tiny, risky businesses while also trying to get bad debt off their books. Due to problems with their banking system, China nationalized its first bank in [20 years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/china-s-first-bank-seizure-in-20-years-spooks-lenders-investors) last year. Then they proceeded to take over [two more](https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-nationalizes-third-bank-in-3-months_3036953.html). This over-leveraged banking system had been showing its cracks before coronavirus made China grind to a halt for a month. Questions have been raised as to whether or not the industry can be leaned on for an economic recovery as hard as the Chinese government is leaning on it now.

This was an economy [in trouble](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/business/economy/china-economy-gdp.html) before the coronavirus hit. The [shadow banking system](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-08/trouble-is-brewing-in-the-darkest-corner-of-china-shadow-banking) appears to have gotten out of control. [Shadow banking accounted for 39% and 45% of total lending in Q1 and Q2 2019](https://www.ft.com/content/4c66b622-dea5-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc). According to Bloomberg, wealth managers have been offering “high yield products” to investors and have been using their own capital to make these returns whole due to that high default rate mentioned in the last paragraph. The Bloomberg article states that, “because the products are opaque and regulation is minimal, nobody knows exactly how much money is at risk.” This article is from October 2019, before coronavirus became a concern.

This is not an economy poised to bounce back like it did with SARS in 2003, despite what the market thinks. It might take a while for the market to realize it, but all it takes is a look at the data to see why that assertion is false. The market is focused on the fact that the virus won't kill us all and not on the fact that the lost revenue from Chinese consumption cannot be made up, despite the CCP propaganda that is being put out from Chinese government officials and Chinese economists. [An article from Barron’s](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coronavirus-brings-chinas-debt-problem-back-into-light-51581679800?mod=hp_LEAD_1) has this to say:

>One area, in particular, is back at the forefront—local debt. Policy makers have directed regional lenders to tolerate a higher threshold for bad loans, hoping to keep thousands of small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from collapsing amid the economic standstill. A survey conducted recently by Peking and Tsinghua universities—China’s top two schools—found that two-thirds of such firms said they could stay afloat no more than one to two months with their current savings. An additional 18% said they could last at most three months.

>Put another way, 85% of China’s SMEs would crumble within three months without financial injections of some sort.

[Here](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/china/china%20and%20the%20world%20inside%20the%20dynamics%20of%20a%20changing%20relationship/mgi-china-and-the-world-full-report-vf.ashx) is a report from McKinsey from July 2019 that has a lot of good data in it regarding China’s exposure to the world economy. I’m just going to post some direct quotes and charts from the report and let you decide what they mean:

>In 11 of the 16 quarters since 2015, consumption contributed more than 60 percent of [China’s] total GDP growth.

>In the United States, among the firms listed in the MSCI USA index, revenue exposure to China amounted to 15 percent of the IT sector, 7 percent of materials, and 6 percent of industrials. In 2017, US companies were estimated to have generated around $450 billion to $500 billion revenue in China through a mix of exports and revenue from Chinese subsidiaries.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/tebHQRv.png) is a chart from the report showing how exposed the world is to China. Luckily for us, as shown in the above report, US exposure to China is not as massive as you might think. The exposure comes mostly from the rest of Asia, Australia, and Africa instead of developed markets. However, the amount of exposure from developed countries is not negligible. The technology sector, which has driven the majority of our stock market growth, has a [disproportionate exposure](https://i.imgur.com/UeBdEB0.jpg) to revenue coming from China, especially semiconductors like Intel, Micron, Nvidia, and AMD. That chart uses data from 2017 so I would almost guarantee it is less now, but still concerning.

While 4 of the 5 mega caps that make up [almost 20% of the S&P 500’s value](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4323952-s-and-p-500-five-great-tech-titans-of-america) and have generated [1/5 of S&P 500 returns since 2009](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-15/all-the-ways-stock-market-bulls-have-gone-off-the-rails-again) don’t have much, if any, China exposure on a surface level. However, Apple derived [16.7% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/apple-impact-of-coronavirus-on-china-business.html) from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2019. Not to mention that Foxconn factories are still mostly closed down over there and not producing anything. Additionally, [20% of Amazon’s COGS for private label brands is attributable to China](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/how-much-amazon-wayfair-will-have-to-boost-prices-tariffs-2019-9-1028499095). Due to how prevalent indexing is, I believe that a tech selloff lead by semiconductors and Apple (just like the old trade war selloffs) would drag down all megacap tech stocks and present a good entry point for an eventual recovery.

All of this comes on top of Boeing’s struggles with the 737 Max, which are expected to cut US GDP growth by [20%](https://www.axios.com/boeing-production-freeze-gdp-impact-737-max-d2b3b7c9-9a3b-4a2a-a3a0-a49fb54156d0.html) in 2020. In 2017 and 2018, China accounted for [22%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/boeing-plane-deliveries-china-737-max-crash-comac-airbus-trade-deal-51579101765) of Boeing plane deliveries. In 2019, that number dropped to 12%. These struggles with China’s economy and the self inflicted 737 Max struggles will put even more downward pressure on US GDP growth for this year. The phase one trade deal was expected to help Boeing out, but there are now [questions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/14/china-united-states-trade-deal-commitments-coronavirus-trump-energy-huawei/) as to whether or not China will hold up to their end of it. 

In addition to these Chinese economic struggles, other Asian countries are showing economic woes as well. Singapore just cut their 2020 GDP forecast from 0.5%-2.5% to -0.5%-1.5%. Japan released their Q4 2019 GDP numbers, showing its largest GDP decline since 2014, an annualized rate of [-6.3%](https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en/news-and-analysis/singapore-cuts-2020-growth-forecast-japan-gdp-slumps), coming in way lower than analyst expectations of -2.6%. This was before the coronavirus started sweeping Asia, the Q1 GDP numbers could be worse. While China is responsible for 12.6% of our trade, Japan accounts for 5.4%. A Japanese recession will hurt us too.

To summarize and give some of my personal opinions to go along with this data, I believe the Chinese economy is in a lot more trouble than most people realize. The shadow banking system is massive and their banks are incredibly over leveraged. There are questions as to whether or not banks can perform the economic stimulus that China is demanding from them to keep small and medium sized firms open. I believe that the data shows China is in very dangerous economic territory that could lead to a recession or at least a major drop in growth for at least Q1 and Q2 2020 that cannot be made up in the second half of the year. It appears to me that these China economic troubles will take a lot of Asia and other developing economies down with them. It remains to be seen if it will take the American economy down too, but I believe that semiconductors and Apple should be trading lower than their current valuations to reflect potential lost growth and revenue streams. I also see Boeing’s struggles continuing to weigh on our GDP growth. I believe the market is fundamentally mispricing risk in the technology sector right now and it will overcorrect downwards in the near future.

TL;DR: China’s economy is potentially going down led by an over-leveraged banking system and it may cause our tech stocks, which derive supply and demand from China, to lead a market correction. Comparing this coronavirus situation to SARS is extremely disingenuous due to the state of the Chinese economy in 2003 compared to the state of the Chinese economy now. The downward pressures from China on world GDP growth as well as Boeing’s pressures on our own GDP growth create a significant risk in all world equity markets that is not being priced in. I’m not saying we’re definitely heading towards a US recession or even a global recession, but the risk should not be ignored by world markets, no matter how much liquidity central banks pump in.

It's a sure thing. Here's why: 

Why $WORK? Because $WORK is Slack. Slack is messenger poised to take over communication as we know it. No longer will organizations rely on emails as the chosen method of communication, Slack is an organizational messaging and knowledge base tool which today, has been adopted as the communications model of choice for several fortune 500 companies.

600,DD,Fed Repo Operations - First Draft,0.8411,f6njq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6njq8/fed_repo_operations_first_draft/,38,1582201523.0,"So I've been wanting to do this for a while and finally sat down and did some work on it tonight.

I've been curious about the Fed Repo operations for a while - I initially was operating under the incorrect assumption that each repo amounted to a cash infusion to the market. It's not, and in retrospect it's ridiculous to assume that the fed is giving away 60B in free money every day (in exchange for treasuries and MBS).

What they actually appear to be doing is giving out what amounts to short term loans to banks so those banks can meet liquidity requirements. Each of these 'loans' or repo operations has a deal date (when the deal was struck) and a maturity date (when I'm assuming the Fed needs to get its money back from the banks involved in the deal).

A lot of the repo operations are 1 day deals meaning that repayment is required the next day, but not all of them. Actually a lot are 7 day deals or 14 day deals. This means that the fed has been running a negative balance ever since these repos started.

I decided to try and calculate what that running balance is and below are my results:

https://preview.redd.it/le2jwcl490i41.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f6f9c41f7a1079db5cb5daa016bc7761b82bc88

Numbers are in billions. Red line is total amount submitted (by the banks, meaning how much they requested - see [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-repo-overnight/ny-fed-accepts-all-73-5-bln-bids-submitted-at-overnight-repo-operation-idUSL2N2720IE)), blue line is total amount accepted (by the fed). Note the big discrepancy over the last week and a half.

This is just a first take and doesn't include reverse repos which I believe are when the fed accepts money from banks, overall these don't seem to be as common as regular repos and aren't for as large amounts.

Data source: [https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-search-page](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-search-page)

Analysis:

I'm not going to post my code (yet) but essentially what I did is for every date, calculate which repos were 'active' (meaning they had been agreed upon prior to the date and hadn't reached maturity yet, meaning the fed still hadn't gotten their money back) and add up the values of 'total submit' and 'total accept'.

Again, this is a first analysis and I'm not sure that any of this is accurate so take it with a grain of salt. If there's anyone who has more knowledge about this I'd be happy to discuss this and redo the analysis.

Edit #4:

I know correlation isn't causation... but... for fucks sake

Sad you missed out on the SPCE train? Me too, but get off your ass and stop whining. We have another chance to moon: Rite Aid is our next tendie train. Yes, I’m talking about the glorified liquor store that got fucked in the ass after the failed Walgreens merger a few years ago. 
            But things have changes. The old CEO John Standley who was a boomer douchebag that basically actively sabotaged the company and brought it from $180+ per share to penny stock status. But management had been changed with sexy CEO mommy Heyward Donigan two quarters ago and also a new COO. During Heyward’s first quarter, the company was already showing that it was rebuilding strength. It’s EPS improved and beat expected by 47.33%. Last quarter’s ER, they beat the $0.15 expected EPS by 261.47% with $0.54 actual. The stock price surged from $7-8 a share to $23.88 in a week. However, profit-taking, gay bears and short ers took tanked it, but RAD found a new support level at around $12. 
           Listening to the last earnings call, the company has very good guidance. They are planning to expand their digital platforms and other services. From the ER call: “We’ve seen the benefit of Rite Care in our business, in our third quarter results, which reflect growth in ancillary immunization of more than 47%, which is outpacing the competition.” Also, “digital sales have been growing over the past few quarters, with a 69% increase in Q3, driven by digital refills. They’ve also released Rite Aid branded ice cream, which has been huge success.
           There are going to a couple catalysts coming within the next month and a half. On March 16th, Rite Aid will be hosting an Analyst Day. During the conference call, they’ve repeatedly refused to answer some questions with the reason that they are saving it for Analyst Day. Must be good news. Earnings is on April 9th, which I am expecting to be huge. The sell-off last quarter after the earnings rally was because people were not fully confident that RAD could deliver consistently. But this ER will be bigly for the company. The last few months, the stock was struggling to break the $13 resistance. Last Thursday, it smashed into $15 before falling back to $14. It’s about to smash through $15 again today. RAD to $30 as soon as it gets moving.
*****Alright here comes the fun part.
This stock has a 36% short interest. There is massive potential for a short squeeze. The market cap is fucking tiny, at 743 million. Here is an opportunity for us to pump the fuck out of this company. A market cap thats 5x less than SPCE means 5x more tendies and options are dirt cheap at the moment. Also, coronavirus panic + pharmacy stock = tendies. The daily volume on RAD has been picking up lately. The price spreads on 4/17 calls are enormous. Guess which fucking stock had huge spreads right before it mooned? TESLA. Yes you heard it here first, RAD is the new Tesla.

TLDR: ALL IN ON RAD FOR RADICAL TENDIES. Give it the good ol’ WSB pump, get on the train before it leaves you with only FOMO tendies. 3/20 or 3/27 calls to play Analyst Day on 3/16 and 4/16 calls to play the earnings on 4/9

If the beer virus doesn't tank the market this is freest money you will ever see. Semiconductor stocks are way up, AMD and NVDA are printing like crazy. AAPL is still putting up impressive numbers in spite of the guidance adjustment they just gave. As some of you may know most of the big semiconductors are reliant on three companies. Here's a chart to show where the money goes:

https://i.imgur.com/lSB6Psm.png

Global Foundries is a private fabricator (sorry no tendies on these guys), they focus on the older 14nm process (they tried 7nm and gave up because they found it was unaffordable to outfit a plant to fab the chips. Because of this IBM switched to Samsung for it's next-gen chips). Intel is also famously struggling to get 7nm up and running. Only two companies really have play in the 7nm space, Samsung and TSMC (traded as TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. TSMC is largest dedicated semiconductor foundry in the world. Nvidia, AMD, and Apple all buy chips from TSMC. The more each of these companies is in demand, the more money TSMC makes. Their competition is weak right now, Samsung Semiconductor is huge, but you can't invest in them, and they only really make chips for their phones sold outside the US. Though Samsung did just recently win over Qualcomm, they will be splitting this deal with TSMC. Samsung also sells chips to IBM, but those chips are for supercomputers, servers, and mainframes, not for consumers. Samsung mostly focuses on DRAM and SSDs. TSMC is in a position right now where it is indispensable to a lot of the world's largest corporations (Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon all use TSMC products). Literally can't go tits up. Right now all these companies are on an absolute tear. TSMC announces earnings on April 16th and option prices are ripe. Go get them tendies boiz.

In short, TSMC splitting QCOM 5nm with Samsung. TSMC locked in 5nm A14 Bionic for AAPL, 7nm Big Navi for AMD, and 7nm Ampere for NVDA. They are also expanding rapidly to meet the rising global demand for chips. PS5 and Xbox Series X chips are also produced by them. They are selling chips faster than they can make them.

Edit: Forgot to mention Huawei is about to surpass Apple to become TSMCs biggest customer. Also TSMC and Global Foundries were in a patent feud for a while that was locking both companies up. They have decided to call a patent truce and won't have to worry about any restrictions for the next decade.

After this was announced, KR went from trading at 28.40~ to as high as 30.70 on Tuesday when the market opened. Full transparency, I hold positions at 30C for 2/28 and 30.5C for 3/13 that I purchased at near market cost on Tuesday.

While I could've flipped my 30C calls I purchased on Tuesday for as high as a 1,600% return at one point, that wouldn't be true WSB fashion because I'm here for the huge gains, right? Well, after doubling up on my position today when it dipped to as low as $0.24 for the 30C options, I'm prepped for the rebound after this dip to 29.54 today.

This coupled with their Expected EPS of 0.56 (up from 0.47) to be reported on 3/5 is looking to make some big tendies in the week leading up to EPS pre-market. I'm sure the 2/28 30C will be shooting up pretty high from their current dip in anticipation for that.

I'm feeling good about this because I've held NVDA through the dip to 232 and saw the gains through 290C, not that that has any relation really but the gut hasn't failed me yet. Plus, this is a Wendy's.",2020-02-20 01:18:17

**Fundamental:** Zillow has been following the footsteps of RDFN and the earlier homebuilders of Lennar, KBH and others. This sector tailwind has boosted Zillow’s price nearly 2X in the span of less than 6 month. Zillow’s home flipping segment, while generating additional losses, has completely revitalized the revenue growth story. However, a concern is the revenue recognition method, which calculates the wholly flipped house sold price as revenue, rather than the incremental cash earned. Fishy, but not that fishy, as a secondary margin KPI tracker can be used to supplement this revenue methodology.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish divergence. RSI shows around 75, overbought. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and in open interest. Implied movement of about 11.8% or 6.50$.

**Sentimental**: Redfin recently spiked off a very strong earnings with narrower losses and increased revenue. The stock shot up even after a strong quarter of price growth. Zillow here is expected to follow the same pattern, with potential to short squeeze due to 15% short float. The downside would be missing expectation and lower guidance, though I doubt management will let that narrative happen. December was very strong overall for the home industry and Zillow should follow suit.

**Technical**: Priced above in 20, 50, 200 day moving averages.  MACD shows bearish divergence. RSI shows around 60, moving towards overbought. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and neutral  in open interest. Implied movement of about 5.8% or 17.30$.

**Sentimental**: DPZ has been on a tear, coming from a september low of 230 to almost 300$ before earnings. Going into this quarter, EPS is expecting to show a 10%+ YoY growth. The main concern here is the lackluster performance last 2 quarters and the continued strength of delivery networks eroding DPZ’s delivery strength. Wildcard here would be a special dividend payout that will stabilize the stock price or even send the stock upwards.

**ROI: 18%**

**Risk Level: 4 out of 5, Very Risky**

**Sell 3/6 320 call Buy 3/6 325 call**

616,DD,Autist Car Auction CPRT,0.9998,f6cypj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f6cypj/autist_car_auction_cprt/,35,1582157879.0,"Hello fellow autists,

I know many of you like buying nice cars just like me. I like to buy them at deep discounts. Preferably something that has already depreciated massively. 

Copart has auctions worldwide, a new one is opening in Germany. 

Many of the cars and trucks are salvage, but you can get insane deals on Lambo's Ferrari's and Bentley, if that's your thing. 

I mostly buy cars that are being sold by Insurance companies. It is listed whether its sold by insurance company or not. 

Run and drive, minimal damage so I can fix it myself.

Private citizens can also sell cars on the site. 

They also charge a massive amount in fees. Here's an example of the fee structure of a car I purchased. 

11/14/2019 SALE PRICE 3,250.00

11/20/2019 HAZ MAT COMPLIANCE 10.00

11/14/2019 BUYER FEE 400.00

11/14/2019 INTERNET BID FEE 79.00

11/14/2019 GATE 59.00

11/14/2019 SALES TAX 406.21

11/20/2019 COPART MAILING FEE 20.00 COPART MAILING FEE

11/20/2019 STORAGE 5.00 FROM 11/19/19 - 11/19/19

11/21/2019 LATE PAYMENT 50.00

11/20/2019 STORAGE 10.00 FROM 11/20/19 - 11/20/19

11/20/2019 SALES TAX 16.91- Secured Funds Adjustment

11/21/2019 STORAGE 15.00 FROM 11/21/19 - 11/21/19

11/21/2019 BUYER PAYMENT 15.00-

11/20/2019 BUYER PAYMENT 4,272.30-

NET DUE (USD) .00 Paid Through: 11/21/19

As you can see, I paid almost 20% of the cars value in fees, yet its still worth it. 

They always beat earnings. Insurance companies need a way to get rid of cars in accidents to recoup salvage value. This company will always have business. 

Earnings after close today
